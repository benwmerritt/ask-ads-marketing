Check check check is the mic. Can we make it louder a little bit or we're good. Okay? Yeah, is yours on I already need a mic No time yo, there we go shit y'all can turn me down a little bit So Gary feet he's turning Michael a little bit or I have to do a job just put the mic down Check check check check check check check check check check check check. All right, so Gary V is here Thanks mom a lot of inspiration out there about investing and things of that nature So what should people be looking at right now as far of investments and making some real money or what we should be should we be Looking at well, I think we need to actually this is not going to be as hype and everybody's not gonna be pumped with this answer But I'm pushing practicality. You know, we've got eight years of a good economy Like this world of ours and this is and I mean if you're here, you're ambitious You know what's going on in the new world your height? You've got a lot of energy entrepreneurial your risk-taker the problem is for when I look at this crowd There's so many young people who've never lived through the punch in the mouth. Yeah, you know So after eight, you know after eight great years in our economy I just I want people to pay attention to actually making money, you know users and engagement and followers Those are you know lifetime value Cack all this stuff that people talk about in the startup world is all nice and dandy But if your business is not making money each month and it's losing money You're not gonna be raising money when there's none out there and so I'm pushing practicality. It's boring But it's tried and true now Let me ask you John now jazz a multi-million selling artist. Yeah, you had your ups and downs You would you were locked up you went to jail. Yeah, um, but you never lost a step you you can you know, you been great You know, we never seen you lose a car we never seen any repos So explain to the people what you did to make sure that your fortune was still intact. I mean, you know first thing that happened to me that Was a red flag that went off and it probably was the best thing that happened to me was the beef because I realized that my livelihood was In a business that is subjective You guys don't have to like job. You don't have to like Drake. You don't have to like envy But tech is different, you know, everybody uses Instagram everybody uses Snapchat everybody, you know Uses these things because there are necessity so That was a blessing in disguise for me because I realized that I need to You know get something with a little bit more substance to carry me through my 40s and beyond and so I started looking into getting into you know Tech tech world and invested in based investment in different companies and I've so far invested in about four companies and I Want one just exited so we just got a nice And I found another one which is fire which is doing really well with profitable and I tell the people what fire is if they don't know fire is basically a Booking app for all talent So we basically cut out the middle man. It's a shit show, you know when you're trying to book talent, you know and a lot of you guys out here You know that a young entrepreneurs, you know with nice healthy bank accounts Probably can afford some of the talent but don't know how to get to them and we'd love to have a job rule or somebody at these Type of events or at your corporate, you know Christmas party or Bob Mitzvah So Me and my partner we created this platform People such as yourselves the private sector and then also, you know professional Buyers as well to really cut through all the red tape and get to the artist that they want to get to you know real real seamless So with the app that what makes the app so dope is let's say you want to book Let's say you want to book Gary Vee. Good idea. Good idea So instead of going through a booking agent and going to management you put your offering and it goes directly to Gary Vee's app Gary Vee can decide if he wants to accept that or decline or say I need more money or less money or whatever it may be And it's direct. You don't have to worry about the agents You don't have to worry about booking fees is direct to the consumer, which is dope Now Gary Vee you get a lot of shit sometimes for telling people about themselves and telling people to get off their ass All the time So tell people about why you are so hard on people about getting off their ass and really getting into Invest in doing some of the things that you do Truth is I'm only saying that to people that complain Like the problem is most people are complaining right like my advice is very basic I just don't understand why you would complain versus doing something about it. Everybody's got something You know, everybody's got some issue, you know Minorities the family grew up with the neighborhood you came from Got screwed by this person all the kids that were told to go to college and amass a tremendous amount of debt to get a good job Fucked all of them. Like, you know, so so I think that I think I for me There's a lot of people that have personal brands that put out content that are tricking people and they don't want them to succeed and They want to just get money from them to make money themselves make a couple thousand bucks on their course I want the people that watch me to eventually never watch me again My big thesis is to have less followers not more because I want to give the tools and the blueprint for them to go do Instead of reading another fucking book or going to another fucking conference Like eventually all that shit is just disguised excuses because you don't want to put in the actual work that it takes to win Right, you know one thing about Gary V, you know when I first met Gary V I really wasn't fond of him. I really didn't like him And I'm gonna tell you why because you hit you hit this all the time You know from inspiration speakers or yeah, and they tell you what you should do and it seems like it's a ripoff You should be working harder And I tested Gary V live on air and I said well since you know so much mr. V He did tell the people who listen right now what they need to do and he broke it down What people can do to make money because that's a lot of people's thing. They say well, I have money But I don't know what to invest. I don't know how to read the stock market. I don't know what I can invest in that will make me money I don't want to lose my savings and you came up with some great ideas, which made me love Gary V's like he really about helping people My big thing that I got lucky with is I know how to make money outside of set like the money I've made in my life has been about building businesses. I built a liquor store like I built an agency that goes after fortune 50 companies I'm not trying to get their money like a lot of people that look that part. So for me. It's the other way I'm trying to disproportionately help because that's legacy. I'm gonna get my currency elsewhere. This is about legacy This is about people emailing you and saying fuck you helped my life that shit listen when I get an email from my team of like We want an RFP. I don't give a fuck you get an email from somebody who's like I was on welfare Now I'm not because I watched fucking breakfast come on like fuck. That's some crazy shit You know like that feels better. I've always been able to make money. That's my talent You can make you know art like like people have skills. I'm good at that this now with the communication paths We have it's why I love doing your show a lot of fucking people listen to your show I can go on there and use that Distribution to help somebody and then that builds legacy. That's how you build brand. I'm in for marathon money not sprint money Absolutely Now now what about you as far as investing? What do you look for in the company when you're looking to invest and put money towards something? It depends, you know, I'm a passion guy, you know, I go with things that I'm passionate about that You know, I can actually go out there and promote with my heart if I can't do that then I'm not gonna fuck with it because It's not real to me, you know So I look for things that that I'm interested in that that I think are great companies that have a Future not not just a quick, you know exit strategy, but actually some companies, you know Have a real real plan of how they want to change the world and move things forward and move our culture forward So I love those type of companies now. What about you Gary V? I mean other You know another reason I really didn't like you is because you're a jet fan and I'm a Giants fan You know, you said one of your main goals is to actually buy the jets that I don't know why you want to do that You know, maybe the giant I want to do it because we need a fucking Super Bowl So now when you look into Acquiring something invest. What do you look at in this world in the South by world? I look for the jockey over the horse So I'm looking at does she have the fire to change her business Nine months in when the market changed on her so in startup land It's hard like when you go like when you're building something from zero like in public light Like let me tell you guys how all to make money no joke If you're sitting on money every person here should invest in Facebook And then when the world melts in nine months and the stocks in half and you hate me don't sell it Just hold on because I promise you in nine years that investment's gonna return you a fuckload of money So that's the slow double or triple your money bet But that's kind of better than the fucking zero interest you get in the bank The the way to make crazy money is to only bet on the jockey because they've got a pivot They've got to adjust, you know the operator the pilot She and he is the one that's gonna dominate and win because the reality is These startups are so young and early like Facebook looks nothing like what Facebook looked like nine years ago He made a bunch of adjustments like this shit changes and you've got to be used to that Spotify had to adjust Birchbox has to adjust like like everybody's navigating and just raising capital or looking the part So I'm looking for somebody who can get punched in the mouth spit the blood out and move forward Is anything else that you guys want to tell the people since we have man is sitting here listening jump no I just want to you know get on that what you just said The adjust you know my company fires With eight months in we probably adjusted Twice you know to because when you start a company you realize You know these these things sometimes have legs that they own and they Take on different terms that you didn't expect and you got a kind of going in and attack and tackle those situations So I'm a hundred percent agree to the adjustment. Can we do maybe like two or three questions? Absolutely anybody got questions? Go ahead. You gotta yell out. Hi An alcohol infused cupcake company cool That's Year five Okay Okay Yep Okay So a brand can change all the time right like just because you're called Sin City doesn't mean it won't work somewhere else You just have to execute the bigger question is how does your model? Change when people are not buying $52 cupcakes because they're not drunk as fuck and it's that one weekend They have to escape right so when they're in Dallas now what I would do is I would level it up Mentally into escapism what Vegas really is is escapism. It's a break from your reality So if you're gonna go to New York or LA or Dallas or Miami There's pockets even though the whole city isn't that there's pockets of escapism And so you should reverse engineer the psychology of the people that actually buy your product and then level that up And that's how I would think about second and third locations What replicates the mentality of the decision-maker in those places? Now one thing Gary Vee told me on the breakfast club that that stuff with me is Of course when the breakfast club you have a lot of following on social media and we sell a lot of different things But there's merchandise we own a juice bar or car wash the different things But he said you have to use your social media, right and in the bio of my social media I was sending it to all different places But what he said on the breakfast club is in your bio when people click it make it to where they can go and purchase something Not just randomly click into your podcast not randomly click it And we've seen sales of the juice balls shoot up by just changing that little thing and I wanted to say thank you for that I think the one thing I could tell you and again looking at the demo You have to be the architect and the plumber Right and the Mason and the garbage person like like the thing that I have a lot of pride in is I can come on and talk All high-level and then when somebody calls me to the mat like you did so the reason I love you is I do a lot of shit And I just pontificate and nobody calls me to the mat We run out of time and I leave you called me to the mat I'm like, okay, and but what I'm excited about is that's my best moment because if you want to go into details I'll get so finite into that detail So to me the one thing I would pride myself in as you grow in your business How many people here have a business that has more than five employees? great ten 20 Great so like as I look around this is great There's enough to talk about this as you grow the thing that I have the most pride in is VaynerMedia now has 800 employees not one of them that works for me does as much actual social media as I do I'm still by far and that's what but probably the biggest reason My side hustle is Gary V is because it keeps me grounded in actually the doing of the shit that I'm doing And what happens to a lot of people as they grow they get away from the work and they become a manager And then they don't know what the fuck they're talking about If that's not your actual business Then then that's a different thing if that's part of your business But if it's your actual fucking business the amount of people that roll up on me like Gary I got a social media agency this and I asked them for social media tactical questions and they have no fucking idea I'm like you ain't shit. You're full of shit, dick I Sorry That's what I think any other questions to Gary via job go ahead over here. Oh, there you are I know I love it Jai your your perspective on internship and man, you know, I really like to see interns are easy to me because Your interns should want to grow with the company and want to run through walls and do everything possible to to help you in and to Take their career to the next level. So so for me interns are easy. It's more I look at the employees At my workplace where I feel as though I take on a kind of a new way of Nurturing my employees, you know kind of giving them that five o'clock break to go to fucking Yoga Give them a longer lunch, you know, let them go out Lunch in the office go have a good time with it come on back because it keeps them Focus it keeps them wanting to work for the company keeps them wanting to be great And and I think that those things help, you know, nurture and grow your business I have a pretty similar answer with one little twist to me whether it's interns or Employees you have to reverse engineer them one by one So John's talking about a lot of people who do want to take a break can't keep Concentration and hustle for 14 hours a day Meanwhile somebody else as an intern wants to work 19 hours a day every day because they want you to pay more money I'm pumped that I know that Ben Ben Ruby who's sitting right there came to me You have to be open to him and making him feel safe that when he came into my office six months ago and said yo, bro I don't want to be known just as a snapchat guy. I'm like cool, Ben I get that or Emily in the four different functions She's done at Vayner or Steph Fagley who worked at Vayner But I always knew had other ambitions and I helped her get that next job, right or Kim Garcia Who's so fucking ambitious and monster? I'm always sweating when I have a meeting with her because I know I have to step up and give her more challenges and And our last conversation was do I have something for you? Which I created or was this gonna be the end of our thing? Those are four or five different people who have four or five different things and I'm trying to scale that with 800 people I want to know do you want to make I love when people like millennials like worth like balance and their Millennials want fucking cash, too Like and so and so if you're a millennial that wants cash Then you got a like when people I love when people like Gary I want to be the CEO of this company when I meet with them. I'm like Mazel tov I'm like I'm like you need to work 20 hours a day every day for the next 13 years And then they're like, all right, let me think about that So I I don't want to for an intern. It's super simple. You go right up to her and say Catherine What the fuck do you want out of this? She may say I want a job here You'll tell her how to work on things she may say I know that you know Gary V and I want to work at Vayner Media Then you should email me you can't make the call for them You need to figure out what it is and then put them in that position to succeed one by one by one Alright Questions Yeah Yep I don't I do not I do not have any interest in my employees worrying about I'm the CEO. I mean that. I don't need, I don't need, their headaches are what I just told you, which is my door is open. Most of them don't take me up on it. So then I watch them and I listen. I've got a hundred people internally that give me optics to the other 700. I follow all 800 of them on social and try to pay attention. I created an HR division that is much more in the offense and not about the paperwork, hiring and firing. And I just try the best I can. I mean, you just do the best. I mean, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say you just do the best you can. It's no different than parenting, running a business, putting out. You just do, like everybody's beating themselves up. If you just do the best you can, that's, it's the intent, my man. The intent is what matters. For the most part, eventually they know that's actually what I give a fuck about and then that's what wins it over. It's not the tactics, it's the religion. For me, I wanna answer that too because I have a different thing going on because I'm, you know, jar rule, so. But I say that to say a lot of my employees were kids that listened and grew up to my music. Yeah. And so they're somewhat fans. So I'm not always in the office, you know, because I'm traveling, I got to move around still. But I may get my business to go into the office and see what they're doing. They have because I know at some point they probably think I don't give a fuck. You know what I'm saying? They're like, Jaws busy and Jaws doing Jaws. But I'm making my business to come in and let them know I'm interested in what you're doing. I got my eye on what you're doing. And I want to be a part of, you know, what you guys are doing every day, all day. So if you have any, second thing, if you have any questions, come in my office, my door's open, and I'll come and stop down at their stations too. Just check on them and make them feel wanted and part of the company. The other thing, do you have a company? And how many employees do you have? Great. The biggest key, this is subtle. You can't let your five to six more senior people think they have any more equity with you than your bottom five or six. It's such a big one. Yeah. One of the best things going for Vayner, most people don't know it, a good amount do. And the ones that do love it, I won't take an SVP's word over a community manager. It's just two human beings. And a lot of times the truth is the bigger you get, the more politics you play to keep the people underneath you because you're just trying to hold on to your $200,000 job. So the biggest thing that I would tell you at 40 is make sure those five are on even playing field with the bottom five and everybody fucking knows it. Yeah. You have the questions? What are your thoughts on Puerto Rico becoming the next Silicon Valley tax exemption? Puerto Rico because of the tax exemption? You think it's going to be the next Silicon Valley? There's a lot of companies moving. I'm aware. You think it's going to be the next Silicon Valley? A lot of companies. That's not what I asked you. That's big. You think 4% tax is going to bring all the best tech talent in the world to Puerto Rico? No. Not only that way. But that's what makes Silicon Valley Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley's advantage is that when you graduate, whether you're in Boston or Puerto Rico or Sweden, you want to move to Silicon Valley. That's the advantage. They have the brand game one and they have the engineers and the tech talent. There's a lot of business talent here. As I look around, not a lot of hardcore back end developers chilling with us tonight. To build the biggest companies. Respect my man. Respect my man. Raise your hand again. Give it up for that man. Let's go baby. Yeah. So the thing my man that a lot of people misunderstand is the engineering talent to build the biggest companies in the world. That's where they all go. And until that changes, that's the hard thing for New York or LA or other places to crack. The biggest thing Puerto Rico needs is what's happening in LA. When you start creating millionaires and billionaires off of big exit like Snapchat and then that creates the whole ecosystem, Puerto Rico, much like Boston, New York, Austin needs that monstrous 10, 20, 40, 80 billion dollar exit and it then spits out all those billionaires that stay in Puerto Rico and build up the ecosystem. That's the key to unlock the next Silicon Valley. All right. Another question? Right here. Gary, I have over the years interviewed you five or six times for different things. Yes. Yes. You've obviously now started looking at strategic ways to develop not just an agency but a sports division. Yes. When you look at the VC world. The VC world. Do you see a mass consolidation happening with that industry as people see your model of which is not necessarily investment by dollars per cent but investment by services. Where is the relevancy of VC's long term? I think VC's going to go through a really difficult time soon. I really do. It's a bubble and a half over valuations. So VC's going to do what it's always done in three or four cycles. You know, VC, as you know and we have been jamming for a long time, 2005, 2006, this whole new web 2.0 thing comes and then everybody's a VC. Everybody's an investor and an angel investor and everybody's got a start up. The second we have a macro economic slow down, which we will, we haven't had one since 2008. I think VC is going to consolidate dramatically. Yeah. LPs are going to pour less money in and we'll have a complete reset. All the B and C and D players in here will get exposed and go work at fucking TD Bank. And then the real entrepreneurs will take more. Like the amount of wealth creation. Exactly. The amount of wealth creation that I'm going to have in the next chapter is going to be extraordinary because I'm going to buy up a lot of people's in this room's businesses for a penny on the dollar. So my question is, do you think more companies are going to start seeing that and being more like what you're doing for your main or other? What you're saying is very smart, my friend. Yes. I think smart money will always win. If you take my million dollar check, you have a marketing machine behind you. You have me. And the reason we're going to sports agency world is Rock Nation is great. Jay-Z's busy. Right? Like he's not helping you. He's leveraging his name. And I'm nowhere close to that. But I will use my assets. The guys I have are about to make so much more money off the field than the people that get drafted three rounds ahead of them. I have a funny feeling that's going to work in my favor in the next draft class. You want to be? Choose me. You're chosen. Done. I got you. I'm in. Beth. All the way. Done. Last question. Last question. Anybody? I got one. Go ahead. Right here. All right. Gary and John want both your perspective on this. You said a lot about betting on the jockey, not on the horse. Yeah. So what happens when the jockeys are really, really good salespeople but they haven't figured out how to scale the business yet? Do you still bet on them or do you want them to figure out both before they get to you? John? As a VC? Angel Investor. You know, somebody who's going to help monetarily as well as other reasons? You know, there's so much due diligence that goes into that type of stuff. You know, I don't like to invest in something that I don't think is a home run or I don't think they have their shit all the way together. You know what I mean? And I won't do it just because it's a passion thing for me. I got to believe in it. I got to want to carry this thing on my back too. So certain situations like that I may slide away from. The way I think I heard you ask the question is you feel like you're really great or your team are really great salespeople but you haven't had the ability before to scale a business so you don't know how to do that yet. Not yet. Yeah. So I'm going to say something that I think you'll like which is great. I'm a big fan on betting on salespeople. Sales DNA is a very good idea. Saving money has a funny way of fixing a lot of problems. So if you ask me, I love sales driven CEOs but I have to see what your business is about. If you're a great sales person but your product is jack shit, it's not going to matter. So there's a lot of factors that go into it but if I had my way, the person is the slight thing that I would bet on but I have to believe in their thesis. If you're like, hey, we're selling this detox fucking mushroom soup, I'm like fuck that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Cool. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Now we're closing. We're closing. Closing? It's 2017. Let's go out and get some fucking money. Gary Vee? Gary Vee? I fucked. That was perfect. I would say let's go make some actual money because shit's about to hit the fan and making money is a very good strategy. It's a funny thing to say but this like South by is loaded with people that are building apps and building theses but don't know how to make money. Give it up for Gary Vee and Jerry.
