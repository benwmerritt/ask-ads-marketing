In the early Vaner days, I don't know if you, you know, this happened to you guys, but one of the kind of objections that we get all the time is, you know, we have people who do this, or our kids do this, or we've got people internally who do this, and it's, you know. I tell them that there's a big difference between the way I play basketball and the way LeBron James plays basketball. There's no accident that Ella's the best you've got. Right. You just tell them right to their fucking face that we're better at it. Yeah, yeah. And if they say, well, we don't value the difference between our B player and your A player, then you say Mazel Tov and you go into the next building. Yeah. Don't dwell on that conversation. Tell them right to the face what you believe and move on. Cool. I mean, it's that basic. Yeah. What are you gonna try to convince the unsellable? Right. I don't give a fuck what your excuse is. It's the excuse and I'm leaving. Right, that's a good point. Did you get that when you were talking to me? Constantly, and I was the guy. Yeah, I was like, that's right. I was the fucking guy and I got it. And I said, great, I'll see you in 2015. Yeah, totally. And so the companies that passed on paying me $5,000 a month came in four years later paying me $80,000 a month. They fucked up. And I love it. Because they deserve it. But I didn't dwell on it or waste my time building my business. Get over it, move on and go to the next person. There's unlimited people you can actually get to. Yeah, and we think that space is so much opportunity there. Next. So the next one. You need to really nail that one in your brain. It will be the best thing that happens to your business. Awesome. Sitting in your bed crying about the girl that didn't want to go out with you for a year is not going to let you find the next girl. Yeah, agreed. Next? Agreed. So now one of the things that we're doing as an agency, I think similar to you guys, is we have things that we want to do on the side of we. We're thinking about doing commerce. We have an information newsletter that we're doing. Get big enough that the distractions are worthwhile. But don't kill the mothership. So that was kind of the one question right. Because I've been part of three other startups previous career. Any successful ones? Vault.com, they eventually got to choir. But you were never sitting at the top? No, no, no. Got it. You were part of the joint. Respect. But always at day one or day 30. So you got to see a lot. I helped build three other companies. Yep. I've been a part of that. And that's been really good now. Good for you. My own thing. I feel good about that. So I think I used to call those when those entrepreneurs would go off into those things. I would call them corporate distractions. Yes. Now I want to do what I want to do these other things. When you're an entrepreneur, you have a wavering eye. Yeah, totally. You're unfaithful. That skirt looks cute. I get it. I've never, you know, it's when it comes to entrepreneurship, I'm playing the field hard. I'm super in love with Vayner. But I'm like, who's that? And that happens to me every day. I'm a scumbucket when it comes to entrepreneurship. And I would tell you that you can go and have a little more fun once you've got a little bit of an established situation. So I would say that be very careful of not doing it too early and realize, you know, there's something I said the other day, like, eat shit for 24 months and then eat caviar the rest of your life. It's not that exact. But that's how I think about it here. Build something that gives you the, you know, build something. And then when it's got enough strength, go do it. The reason there was a big gap in me putting out content was I needed 2011, 12, and 13 to build Vayner. It allowed me then to get back into content, do the PureWOW deal. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used to watch, like, on Revision 3. So I used to run video at Good Magazine and Good Back in the Day. You know, in early YouTube days, it was so amazing. Because you're like, if the video was good and the content was good and there was audience for hundreds of thousands, it was super easy. So we used to sit there and watch, you know, it was Revision 3, right? And Techzilla. And we used to sit there and we'd go, who is this guy talking about wine in New Jersey with the jets? You know, the stuff. It was amazing. It seemed so insane, right? Everything was tech. So there was just like, you said it perfectly. New Jersey, wine, and jets. What the? This guy has fit in wine and cold pocket for 20 minutes on TV. It was amazing. Thank you. And finally, I just really wanted to thank you. I said in my note, I had this kind of serious health issue. That's how all this was born. And so I got well through this total fluke situation. And while that was all happening, it was a tremendous rebuilding period. Around the time we were doing jab, jab, jab, right hook. And so I just wanted to also thank you, because all the energy that you were pouring out on those videos was just my inspiration every day to keep doing what I was doing. And I was literally left or dead by mainstream doctors. And it was like a fluke encounter with someone who led to these amazing guys specializing in Crohn's and colitis, as well as pediatric mitochondrial disorders that got me onto this really unique path of wellness that took a year. So I would just sit on my treadmill as part of my P.D. and Waxies Gary Vee videos all day long. So I just wanted to also just first thank you. It's super hard to consume that, because it just means so much to me. I don't know what to say, but thank you so much. I know, thank you. We're living such an amazing time. If I was born 30, 40 years earlier, I just would have been a really well-liked successful businessman in some neighborhood. We're just so lucky to be living in this time where, listen, man, I don't know what it's going to feel like when I buy the jets, but I'm really going to struggle to think it feels any better than the way my heart feels right now. I really mean it. I mean, other human, think about that. And I feel like I'm just getting started. So it's pretty cool. Thank you very much for that. Thank you so much for the time. Last thing, on the side thing that we're working on, if we get a little more baked, would it be OK if we reached out in four or five months? You made me feel really good right now. You bought yourself some leverage. Yeah, yes. That would be great. Cool. Can I get a selfie? Yeah, of course. Sweet. Thank you. Going to go like crap in the back. Yeah, of course. Awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you for everything. It was very kind. I really appreciate it. Thank you. So happy you worked out for your marriage. Yes, you're happier than I am. I'm one lucky guy. That gratitude, brother. Drive with that. Do not let any, like when I give you that first answer to that question now, that should be a foregone conclusion. Comparatively, do never, you know, this is what happens with life-threatening events. You forget. It's like when the cop car goes and then when it drives back by you, you get, and then you start driving fast again. People don't realize this. You do. I understand it. Thank God I've never had it. People forget. Do not forget. It's just a video game for me now. But you know what? Don't say it, live it. Losing that client, somebody saying no, means nothing. Right. Agreed. Real pleasure. Thanks, dude. Appreciate it. Thank you. Stay well. Thanks, Dora. Bye, guys. Bye-bye.
