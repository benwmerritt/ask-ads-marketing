11 years ago, I was a criminal and not going anywhere. Rather, thank you economy. Graduated, got my first internship. When I got my first job, you were given these away. This is the OG swag. It's been on my desk every single day. And as of two hours ago, I just got promoted to managing director of my ad agency. And none of it would have happened without you. I can't thank you enough. My guy. Your words can never, never tell you. I'm so fucking proud of you. Thank you. I did trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life documented. We're expanding this brand. People are coming into the franchise. The game, the game is legit. Characters resonate. I'm excited to look at these videos in 12 years. Imagine watching videos of Pokemons first year. I'd watch it every day. And look, even how big I dream. I understand what Pokemon is. But don't let me do 50% of Pokemon. You know what I mean? Then it's still a fucking monster. So really excited. How proud are you? I don't know if I'm proud. I'm enjoying the process of building. I love that shit. Like I like the bad days in a way that is so fucking crazy. But I know what this is. It's fun to see the evolution. Gas and trash. Pokemon cards. Gas. National exclusives. Gas. Messi to MLS. Gas. Toronto. Gas. St. Louis. Trash. I'm kidding, St. Louis. I fuck with you. Go ahead. Lamont Jordan. Lamont Jordan? Do you understand that Lamont Jordan of the New York Jets number 34 ran a touchdown against the Raiders? And when he scored, his celebration was to go to the goalpost and act like it was a chainsaw. And he was cutting down a fucking tree. That's super gas, motherfucker. Lamont fucking Jordan, you went there? Yeah. That just made me laugh. That just made my fucking morning. Let's go, Lamont. With the visor. Then he went to the Raiders and he was trash. Lou, that got me going. I'm super pumped. I just got a hollow series one, one-of-one raccoon from this remarkably handsome young man. He will go on to regret this sale for the rest of his life. It's going to end up being one of the worst deals of his career. That's amazing. Thank you so much. What are you thinking? Gary B's. Fox Epic up there. Some man is trying to corner the fucking Gary B market. Gary B life. I got the Epic Gary B yesterday. As soon as I bought it, you're like, fuck it, I knew it was under price. Gary B Epic? Whoa. Yeah, it's gone. I'm a little bit upset about that. I was upset about that one. So did. He's curious. Oh. Oh. He got a gold wizard. Two kids are playing. They both know how to play. It's like kid on kid eight. I got to say it. We're hype on that. Kids, game, watch game. Holy crap. Get a different card to sign. You don't want to sign that one. The kids give away is going to be behind here. Name New York Jets. Till someone fucks up. Mark Sanchez. Ryan Fitzpatrick. Jonathan Vilma. Joe Nameth. Brandon Marshall. Aaron Rodgers. Mark Gaston. Breece Hall. James Robinson. Michael Carter, the running back. Antonio Camardi. Joe Cleco. Let's go. Brandon Marshall. You said Brandon Marshall already. Run the film. I fucking won. He said it. He said it. So let's keep going. We'll keep going. Debrick of Shaw Ferguson. I love Debrick. Nick Mangal. Let's go. Guys, I have like 400 jets on the top of my head. I do not. Let's do. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Let's do. I'm not going to do that. Let's do. Woo. I don't know, man. Yo. The next 100 packs are on daps. Woo. They're the packs. Free packs. Free packs. Daps. Daps. Daps. Take one and give them out. Take one and give them out. I love it, bro. You know how many famous carries are under? They're very rare. So when you came up the game, that 89 Brewers rookie card, I was collecting the shit out of it. My god. Oh, I know everything about you. That was my best friend, Brandon. We did shows together coming up. We had a very, very, very famous story between us when we were 14, where we came up with this cockamani game. And if you won, you would get a prize. And the hottest card was when you were going crazy when you got to San Diego. And the upper deck rookie card was fucking fire. And Brandon had a bunch of them. But everybody took it from us for like $2, because our game was so janky. That's really full, sir. What is that, a funny? The quote of the day is, you live one fucking life. So stop fucking around and do what you love. Stop doing it just for the money, because you're all going to fuck it up. Be patient, be nice to each other, and get your fucking grind. What's next? Animation. Thank you, man. I love you. This is fun. So fun. Love you. I miss you already. Kids, listen to me. If you're good enough, ain't nobody taking your paper. There's more than enough for every winning player. Straw. What's up, Gary? What's up, legend? The first baseball card this man bought. Ever. Ever. Ever. One of the ways that I take pressure off of me now failing in front of others is by reminding people. Love you, Herm. It's reminding people in my circles that I'm human and I make mistakes. Thank you so much. You're absolutely the best, brother. You're so long. I'm proud of you. Good, brother. 11 years ago, I was a criminal and not going anywhere. I read the thank you economy. I graduated. Got my first internship. When I got my first job, you were given these away. This is the OG sweat. It's been on my desk every single day. And as of two hours ago, I just got promoted to managing director of my ad agency. And none of it would have happened without you. I can't thank you enough. My guy. Your words can never, never tell you. I'm so fucking proud of you. Thank you. Would you sign the wristband? I would love to. It'd be my honor. Andy. Wait, who brought this? Who brought it? That's nuts. Wow. How old is this? That works, bro. Where's Trout? Trouty. He needs to see it. We're going to call him. Call him. Get him over here. Thank you, brother. Thank you, Gary. Stay well. Stay well. If you can interview Wala, let it go. He got the gold? Let's go. Yes, Gabe. Let's go, my dude. He got a gold. Should we open a pack? Let's go. Let's go. Ooh. People catapult. I got a good one. I got a good one. Forever Phoenix. Where's Andy? Yo. Yo. This is for you. Thank you. It's a good one. Slap it up. This is it for you, though. You've been running a gangster ring here. I skipped work to be here today. I'm glad you're here. Don't worry. Your boss approved. Thanks, Gary. I worked at 9 to 5, so I come home. I eat, I hang out. And then it's like from 11 to 4 in the morning. I'm back working. I sleep for four hours. And I just keep that cycle going. I don't think four hours is the greatest number. Everybody's body's a little bit different. But in a week where you feel a little burnt out, it's OK that you don't do it at all. The world's not going to stop if you don't go that hard. I would also say working 9 to 5 and only starting at 11. Like, I'd rather you spend a couple more hours on sleep and a little less time on hanging out. One, two, three, three. When I put up the five, don't shake my fucking hand. With Gary V at the National, what do you think about my four year vacation in Monterey now? You mean college? Yes. I think it's the last time you can actually do that. Are your parents paying for it? Most of it, yeah. You should kiss the ground they walk on. That's what I'm saying. Thank you, buddy. I'm teaching a college class. Good for you. I have no idea what I'm doing. Yes, you do. I mean, I'm six years younger than these kids. They're older, so it's like. And the way you said it is why I know. You're letting age be a variable. Age has never had an actual variable on most of things besides earned wisdom. Do not have imposter syndrome or moments of insecurity just because you're of age. There's plenty of people 10 years older than you that don't know half the shit you know. Thank you. Well, appreciate it. My brother, I'm going to hook you up with this, too. That's for you. My man, this is for you. My dude, this is for you. This is for you, darling. Thank you. You're welcome. This is for you and your brothers. For you guys. Have a good show. This is for you. Oh, you sure? I'm sure. Thank you. You're welcome, brother. My man, this is for you. My guy, this is for you. This is for you. Enjoy it, man. This is so right. This is for you. Get from me. Got you. What's up, brother? My friend, this is for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good show. You're welcome. Look it up. My guy, this is for you. Oh, thank you. Because you're swaggy, brother. Thank you. You're welcome. What's up, man? What's up, brother? Thank you. What's up, brother? Look at this. Look at this t-shirt card man. Hey, how is it? Want to sell it? Maybe. How much? It's like a fine amount. Can I give you a really good piece of advice? Yeah. Sell most things. Don't ever sell that. Give me at least 10 years on that one. It's the fucking logo. You literally have a tattoo of it. This guy's debating selling this when he actually has the tattoo of it. It's got to keep it. Awesome. All right, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. I really got to shut down. Day two in the bag. By the way, completely engilted into bringing trash talk back. So making the commitment right now. A lot of comments on that. I feel the card hobby is getting a sense of me out there a little bit today. Yes, friend. That's good. It's a good day. Looking forward to tomorrow. It's fucking Thursday. It's still Friday, Saturday, Sunday. See ya.
