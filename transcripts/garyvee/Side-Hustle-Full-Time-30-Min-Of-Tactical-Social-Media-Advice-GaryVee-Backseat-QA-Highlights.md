If you're trying to take your side, hustle full time, thought is that if I focus 90% of my time on sales, I'd be able to go full time and then have hours to create content, brand, et cetera. I'm cool with that. Marketing is better than sales because it's sales that come to you. In this scenario, Kevin needs to get to that paper to be able to leave his job, to be able to go into content. Yeah, I'm cool with that. That being said, for Kevin included one post on TikTok and one post on LinkedIn could go viral and outflank everything he's doing in sales. I'm putting the work in on social media, believing it's not just luck, but an element of skill and consistency required. He thinks it's pure luck. So my question is, is going viral pure luck? No, viral is not 100% skill. Otherwise I'd go viral every day. But it's definitely not pure luck. Otherwise, like what do we talk about here? Like there's a reason Mr. Beast and I and others like are successful and consistently successful. What have I just been lucky for 20 years? So I think both of you are right, but you're more right because you're choosing optimism and he's choosing cynicism. Anybody who weaponizes luck in life is really interesting position where they have to really self reflect and ask themselves why they think that. Now, I don't know the dynamics here. By the way, the brother that's asking the question could be in the wrong. He might be not working that much, not working that hard and is like posting twice a day on social, kind of putting in three hours of real work even though maybe 10 hours are eaten up and other bro might be making the candles, running the ops, running the finance, running the bucket management, like doing like 10 hours of real work and might have some sort of feelings. So let's not jump to conclusions again. As they always say, there's like two sides to the story and then there's the actual truth. But to answer the question directly, not the underlining question that I can smell in the question, virality is not pure luck. It is also not pure skill-ish. You have to have the skill to put yourself in a position to be viral, including if you go viral for something silly, you have to have the skill of humor. Like why do we continue to diminish people's things? I do not judge what the consumer values. If they value attractiveness, I do not judge, I understand. If they value humor, I do not judge, I understand. If they value information, I do not value, I understand. If they value communication delivery capabilities, I do not judge, I understand. Like if you are a human, this is actually a very important moment in the entire thing, if you are a human being that shits on a piece of content or a human being that has gone viral, you are very likely deploying a massive level of jealousy that is suppressing your ability to have the same thing happen. Instead of saying like the hop to a girl is like an idiot and this is fucked up and why don't you understand what it means? Like what does it mean that like sexual inuendo jokes over index and society? What does it mean? I'll give you an example for me. Does it mean that, let me use a good one. Does it mean that sexuality and sex is a foundational human characteristic, animalistic characteristic that is a universal understanding that makes both sexually expressive parts of the world or sexual, I mean, I don't think a lot of Americans realize how sexually prude America is compared to most of the world. Is a lot of the world's problems created in our relationship with sex as human being? I would say there's a lot of deep shit to what I just said. I feel like I got a lot of huzz or aha in this answer. But like my framework when I see stuff go viral is why. And I wanna go deep, not surface, I wanna get in there. Most people are like that's stupid, this is silly, fuck her, this is garbage, that's funny, ha ha, cool, silly, blah. People go into like dumb shit. Never had a moment where something did get popular and you yourself just was like, I don't get it. I don't get a lot of things. I get that part. I get the part that I don't get a lot of things. The audacity and lack of humility, Dustin, of a human being saying I don't get it and thinking that means it's true is one of the most laughable behaviors in society. Who the fuck do you think you are? You're the composition of eight billion people's interests. I get that my opinion doesn't matter. It's so funny because have you heard the term what about ism? What about ism? I have not heard it yet. It's like this phenomenon online where people will see a video and think that it needs to be catered to them. So it's like what about me? Like I didn't get this, but what about me? I don't like when we create new words. Like imposter syndrome is an insecurity. What about ism is fucking audacity and lack of humility? I don't need to make a new term for it. You motherfuckers who are listening and watching almost all of you are deeply grounded. By the way, I'm a human being. Of course I have audacity and insecurity, but my levels, like in the same way some people are just fucking diesel and zero percent, like I'm fucking deep on this one. It's my superpower. I don't need what about ism, point. I know that most people aren't happy because they're audacious and lack humility. And they don't see it in me because they get the version of me that seems convicted, competent. But what makes me behind the scenes, like really operate is my humility and curiosity. Like when I see humble hedgehog, right? And curious crane, like envy friends, I'm much more like attached to that than conviction cockroach and confident cobra. Even though I like those characters too. I'm a mix, but people are lacking humility, which is why they don't have confidence. Tough to get to pure confidence. People call it ego. Ego's insecurity disguises confidence. True confidence's foundation is humility. Why would I care what people think? Of course I'm not the right cup of tea for most. Of course most people don't think I'm the best looking, the smartest. People have different flavors, different tastes. Like what the fuck's the matter with everyone? Your audacity is eating up your life. Almost everything I don't get. I get that's the way it's supposed to be. And I get excited about my curiosity to figure out. I get everything because there's only 13 things. I may not get it in the nuance, but look where I went with the Haktua thing. I went to core depths of humans relationship with sexuality. There's only 10 things. There's only two things. Good and bad. Light and dark. Then underneath there's 10, 15 things that represent that. And that's why everything's easy for me to read. Show me a human. Let me audit their parents where they grew up in what era. And I'll tell you the fuck they are. Simplicity is what's complicated for most. It's just simple out here. You take it all the way to the bottom of like, just care about the health and wellbeing of the people you love. Fuck it. If you can go all the way there, you will skip and whistle through life. Everything you add on top of that will fuck you up. How do you think we got to a place of over-complicating everything? Materialism has really hurt people. We've lost our way with valuing stuff and achievement over family and community. But just people find that I love collecting. I love chatting. But it's like, it's my hobby, not my life. My work is my hobby. I do not get my self-validation for my professional career. I just do not. You see, you know how I play basketball. The fuck does that pickup game mean? Means nothing, right? I go harder in playing a pickup game than I do in running my companies. It means more to me. But why? Like why? Because I'm very passionate about it. I love it and I'm not in control. In business, I'm passionate about it, but I'm in control. That's why I wanna buy the jet. So I can just take control of this thing that's pissing me off. I also believe that if you care about things that are silly, it's actually very healthy. I'm very hot on this thesis. How do you define what's considered silly and not silly? What's not silly is like, politics is not silly. Because it affects people. Yeah. Sports is silly. Does work silly? I think work is, and this is why I'm shredding lightly because you see where I was about to go. Like everybody has to define it. I think living within your means is not silly. Like while I'm on this tangent, let's get to the punchline because we're going pretty deep here. Everybody on earth gets happier if they live within their means. I think the credit card has a chance to go down as one of society's biggest vulnerabilities. Like in history, it's a new invention. I've only been chilling with the credit card for 50 years. Like I think the credit card is, again, it's not the credit card's fault. It actually can be remarkable if you know what you're doing. I just think most people don't know what they're doing. I think people don't live within their means. That's why I always attack the American dream of owning your house. I love it. Fine, it's an asset. I get it. But motherfucker, people don't play it right. Everybody maximizes their deposit, gives them no cash flow. Anything tweaks off, now they're living paycheck to paycheck. This is why I attack fancy cars and watches. Kudos to all the fucking big shout out, big shout out to all the gangster entrepreneurs who've built something sustainable that allows them to afford a $500,000 watch and they don't even think about it. The way most people think about buying a $5 soda. They're worried about the people that bought it that if God forbid something gets fucked up or they get quitshed thing, get quick rich thing gets fucked up. They have to sell that to a pawn shop and lose 80%. Like it's nuanced. Live within your means. Have four lampos. If that's within your means, easy peasy and you like them. I live that. I buy very expensive pieces of cardboard. I would argue most more people universally think that watches and lampos are better than trading cards. Too many people don't live within their means. That's what's killing. So it is a job silly. If you're living deeply within your means, it can be. You got tons of savings. You don't need a job for five years. If you guys, I don't know your situation. Both of you had 10 years worth of salary saved. My intuition is you'd be less concerned about losing your job or stressed about it. Because you would have optionality. I think people do not realize how much money they spend on how many things during the course of a year and how much it is gone. Like people don't think about savings. And everyone's like inflation and we got fucked by the boomers and no accountability. You know what the boomers think? The boomers think like, I didn't go out to eat every day. We cooked at home. You know what the boomers think? They're like, we didn't have seven purses. I had one purse for nine years. I think people, some people would argue life is short. So I'm just gonna do whatever I want. Then stop complaining. You picked your short path, shut your fucking mouth. By the way, on the record, you can do whatever fuck you want. Don't complain. By the way, a lot of people are right for their individual life, right? Like man makes plan, God laughs. Somebody out there decides to live, burn a fuck, burn it to the ground like fucking $100,000 jet, create enjoyment, live their life. And they were destined to get hit by a car and die at 41 and they played a right. Potentially. It also depends if that's where you get your joy. I can tell you that's not where I get my joy. I know a lot of people do and that's awesome. But look, I get my joy of sitting courtside at a Nixki. That requires money. Again, we all are doing it different. I think everybody can do everything if they shut their fucking mouth. Almost all my content is based on people that talk. I would argue my whole framework is about complaining. I think everything's cool if you don't hurt anyone and you don't complain. You can do whatever the fuck you want. And if you're complaining, I'm assuming you're upset. You know what I complain about? I don't wanna go to gym. And guess what? I don't like it. So complaining comes from a place of unhappiness. I was gonna ask like how black or white are you on complaining? I'm black and white, but that's not, I think that's where we're about to go. Listen, I was raised in a household that demonized the fuck out of it to a point where I think it went too far. Then you start getting into not sharing real life shit. So I think there's a fine line here. Like I am concerned about that part. But yeah, I'm visceral to complaining. I think sharing your struggles is healthy therapy. It's how you form a good relationship, real candor. I think that's different than complaining. And I think that's why everybody's so upset because now people think they're not in charge of their lives. They literally think that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are in their life in America. Stock markets collapsed last, right? Several days. Warren Buffett sold all his stocks a couple weeks ago. Remember I mentioned it? I'm like, this is the most historically correct guy of the game. We could have all just followed. I made a reference to Dustin about it. It was on Teewick EveryEek. It was on Teewick EveryEek. Let's clip it. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of indications that the economy might be crashing. Warren Buffett just took all his money into cash. He's usually right. So now back to accountability. Literally right now, do you understand McKens? How many people write this second? Because we're in it as we're filming everyone. This is the Monday after all this tariff stuff. You could have sold all your stock. You would have made a fortune. Warren Buffett can rebuy all the shit he sold for making fortune. You could have. I'm not even following public markets. And I was aware that Warren did that. I'm like, maybe I should do that. Whose fault is that? Self-accountability sets you free. Sets you super free. It's all your fault. And the second you realize that, life becomes phenomenal. And to the counter that, yes, there are things that happen. Like was it your fault that you crossed the street when that truck came? I guess, I mean you crossed the street, but like, I get it. Like some of us are born with genetic. There's somebody who was born right now into the single most povern stricken part of our world. Of course there's things in life. But if you decide that you are fully not capable of getting out of it, well then it's a wrap. And the world's got to change its tune. That's why I get so mad at eighth place trophies because then those kids don't think it matters. And when you don't think it matters, then you don't think you can.
