Gary Vee, I just got into money my first time. I got 200K. What do I do? I'm like, well, if you don't know what to do, invest in T-Bells and get your five points on your money instead of letting sit in the bank with no risk. If you do know what you're doing, I think certain stocks that kick dividends are interesting. Real estate's great. I lived in my own cocoon for 15 years in the wine business. I didn't know shit. I didn't grow up with all this information. There was no fucking Monday, money fucking podcast. Like the dorks on CNBC were not catching my attention. So I didn't know this stuff. And it's why I love putting out information because like I said on stage, my public life is really made for the 15 year old me. I've come to realize. And so it's really cool that all these kids coming up or not even the kids. It's cool right now that a 53 year old who's going through a transition in her, his life, is listening to this podcast for free while she's working out or driving to work. And people are spitting real knowledge. You guys, me, like, and the other 150,000 people. There's a lot of shit. There's a lot of people like looking to do short-term stuff. But anyway, I'm an entrepreneur who, you know, believes that nice guys finish first. I talked about flipping and dupé and garage-shelving. Yeah, I do like that. Walk us through the concept of that as far as listeners are concerned. That's a good one because it's weird. I've been a little bit on a roll on this. And when I say on a roll, I've probably had 10 to 15 people in the street or the airport or a comic on New York where I was for an hour before I flew out here, referenced the garage sale thing. It comes up a lot, but just it's hot right now, the last three, four days. Anyway, for everyone who's listening, in 2017, I just kind of like had this moment. I was like, you know what? Like, I've talked all about like, oh, invest in the next Twitter, next to Facebook. One thing I do well and one thing I recommend everybody who's listening that does content, you need to read your DMs. That's where you get the insights. That's where you know where people's real feelings are. And I was getting a lot of like, and I was starting to get bigger at the time, and I was getting a lot of like, yo, bro, I fuck with you, but like, fuck you. Like who's got 25 bands to fucking put into a startup? I got $93 in my Wells Fargo. And I got enough of that, that I was like, okay, bet. Like I get it. Let me, like I kind of like, you know, I was like, what did I do? You know, my dad paid me five bucks an hour and I wanted money. I was like, fuck, I was doing garage sale. So, and so I just started talking about it. And then I did the 2017 Flip Challenge. You can go Google it right now, 2017 Flip Challenge Gary Vee. And you'll find the premise, which is if you have debt, or if you have less than $10,000 in your bank account, which a lot of people do. I think people that are fortunate kind of lose touch, then buying and selling stuff that you buy at flea markets, garage sales, thrift stores, storage lockers, Facebook marketplace, Craigslist is real money. Like it's real. And what I like about it is people, a lot of people who don't know how to make money any other way really love it. Now that it's been out there for like six years, the amount of people who were like, yo, I've never known how to make money my whole life. I always worked at this or that. Like everybody kind of knows something. So you go to a garage sale. Like I know what toys are worth on, and video games just because I've studied it for so long, but vintage clothes, like records, like here's the reality. 90% of the stuff at a garage sale that is being sold for a dollar or two is 10 bucks on eBay. And then you get crazy hits. So, you know, I would go to Instagram right now or TikTok and put the hashtag garage sale flip or yard sale flip. You'd be stunned, get educated. We're not gonna get to it here. But on the make money side, especially for all the people listening, we've got 87 bucks. That 87 bucks can really be 10K. And the problem is with the way the world, all the free information's good, but on the flip side, all the kids that are listening right now that have 87 bucks, they think they need to make a million. And I'm like, listen, make 10,000 before you make a million. And when you get to 10,000, figure out how to get 100,000. And then you can get to a million, you know, and getting from 87, you're 30, and you've never had any money to a million. It's not gonna happen. You're gonna chase fads. You're gonna chase bullshit scams. And so, you know, I'm really about that flip. I mean, I did it the other day. I literally, because I still film something called Trash Talk on, you know, I've done 10 or 11 episodes where I just go do it. And it's just there. It's there. And I'm really excited about it. I think most people should be able to make $500 in profit. And like, look, if you're listening right now, and here's the other thing, it's fun for certain people. The game is fun. Especially if you have a partner. Like it's a great father, daughter, father, son, brought me and AJ are real tight. We're 11 years apart. I think both of us would say, besides Jets football, that garage sailing, and maybe even garage sailing more, because during Jets football, we're just being maniacs and focusing, but when you wake up at 6.30, and you go to Burger King, get a coffee, and then you drive 25 minutes to the town wide. So by the way, if you wanna find, if you wanna really crush garage sales, Google town-wide garage sale, because you don't wanna spend all morning going to four. A lot of towns around the country will do a town-wide garage sale, and you can hit 100 in four hours. So that's a little hack. Anyway, but you have to drive 40 minutes to get to the town that's doing it. So for me and AJ, when he was 13, 14, 15, 16, and I was 24, 25, 26, those were real moments when we were driving from seven to eight AM, where he's talking about liking girls, and like school, and like life, and like I'm talking about building dad's business, and like it really bonded us. And so for a lot of people, I've gotten emails of like them and their best friend became closer, because you're grinding. And what's funny is, for a lot of people that don't have money, you know this, they also are commonly very cliche, the person that wakes up at 11 AM on a Saturday. Now they're waking up at 6.30, they're getting that discipline, they're getting home by 11, 12, it's kind of the same, they realize they didn't even, you know, sometimes they're like, I don't wanna fuck up my bowling, or my golf, or hanging out with boys, or to college football, and like be home by it. And it gets them going and it changes it. So yeah, I like Flip Life, I like it a lot, because I also, once you get the first hook, one guy, because I'm so into it still, if someone's like, yo Gary Vee, you really put me on like Flip Life, like changed my life, I'm always like, yo what was your first big one? I'm like what was your first big one? They're like, you'll never believe it. I bought fucking 40 bucks for a thousand fucking CDs, and sold them off for, some were rare, and this Pink Floyd one was like 80 bucks, and I was like what the fuck, and I was hooked. And that's like, I'm still about that life. That's so funny. So let's say someone starts making some money, right? I guess, investing. They hit 10 grand, then 20, then 30, and 40. I got a big one on this. I wonder if any of your guests have said this. I really thought a lot about this, because I do a lot of investing wrong, a lot. What I mean by that, I'm not diversified in real estate enough if you're going by the book. I'm not in the stock market enough if you go by the book. Most of my stock is because I invest in companies that went public, and I still have the stock. I do a lot of things wrong. I invest in very high risk early stage companies. I love collectibles, which are very volatile, cards, NFTs, art, things like that. I'm self aware of what I'm trying to accomplish, which is I'm trying to maximize joy, not maximize money making. So you have to know who you are. So for me, I know that yes, I have these lofty goals of buying the jets, but I feel like I'm gonna do that through operating. V-Friends and VaynerX give me that chance. And I get joy. I wouldn't say it's gambling, but it's definitely in between gambling and investing the right way that I like because it makes me happy. And I get Facebook and Twitter, these investments. I mean, it's gonna take me a while to lose enough money to offset how big those wins were. But then you have to know yourself. For example, here's a weird one, like T-Bills. Like if you don't know, do you know that most of the fucking people who are listening should just get five and a half, 6% of their money? Like that didn't exist three, four years ago. Shit's changed money. It's expensive now, so interest rates are up. So a lot of people who are sitting, I mean, all day long, people are like, GaryVee, I just got into money. My first time I got 200K, what do I do? I'm like, well, if you don't know what to do, invest in T-Bills and get your five points on your money instead of letting sit in the bank with no risk. If you do know what you're doing, I think certain stocks that kick dividends are interesting. Like a Pepsi. It's not going away tomorrow. And they're kicking it, you know? And that's kicking dividends. And then real estate's great. Like, I think if you like it, my dad loved it. That's where almost all his investing went into. Almost none of mine has. I'm bored by it. Like I understand I bought a building and people are paying rent, but I'm like, I don't know, like I don't like it, even though it's great. And like, by the way, most of the last generations billionaires came from real estate because all the tax laws written so positive. Real estate's great if you get off on that. And then there's alternative shit. Like, you know what I will say, for sure. And this is what my number one belief is, is that it's the cross section of something you like and something you understand. I hate when people invest in shit they don't understand because someone's smart told them. Please, my friends, do not invest in shit you do not understand. Which is why I like people buy, though I don't do it, I love people buying stocks of their favorite companies. If you're about Starbucks and like, you do a little reading and you're like, they seem normal. Like do you see how everything's chill? Like, that's a good investment. Buy some Starbucks shares. Like, you know, the stock market's a good bet. Like, the stock market will work as long as America's around. So that's a very good bet. So I think it's a game of enjoying it and a game of understanding it. I think that's what people should focus on. Part of my speech I say, raise your hand if you think Apple will be here in five years. What about Netflix? How about Facebook? Walmart. Okay, raise your hands again if you shop at Walmart. Do you buy Netflix? Do you buy Apple? Do you have Facebook? Okay. So how much? You'll spend $1,500 on your iPhone. Why don't you buy $1,500 of stock? That's right. Right? Buy $500 of Walmart. You like Walmart? Buy $500. You don't have to go put in your life savings. Go buy a little bit of these things over the course of your life. What people don't understand is how advantageous it is to invest too, because they don't know rules. I didn't know them. I didn't know that if you lost an investment, you can write that off against an investment. You made money on it and play the arbitrage there. So like, you know, we don't, we were not educated on money. Well, which is why I'm glad. Yeah, I get it. And so look, chat GBT and Google and YouTube, like learn, like the demo that I feel is listening to this right now just moves too fast. When they first hit money, either in buying something, it's okay to reward yourself. You can't, listen, I grew up with only kids that had nothing. Now I grew up in very lower middle class environments. So I get when you finally do something, you go to buy a crazy car or you know, watch. And listen, let's call a spade a spade, 90% of the dudes do that to get girls. Like, like, like, like I get the human psychology of it all. I would just say, slow down a second. Because if you've got 200,000, if you slow down a second, just slow down. You're more likely to have 2 million. Because if you go fast, you're back to zero. And we all know that. Every one of us in this motor home, know people that got into some money and went to zero, straight zero, or because they were insecure and fucked up, it went up their nose, right? Or it went to Vegas. Or like, you know, slow it down everybody. Like, life is long, like, of course have fun. Like when I talk about like, you know this, I've for a long time talked about like, don't buy all this stuff. And a lot, most of the people in these circles are mad at me. I'm not saying don't buy a Lambo. I'm not, I'm saying, and am I like, even that's fine. Do you know why you're buying it? Like if you like have loved cars your whole life, red car magazines, like, I go into a car, there's no enjoyment. There's no, like, I don't, like all my friends who like, I know genuinely like it, like I don't understand like the speed you don't get. I don't like that. And so for me, that's not right. If that's right for you, then that's amazing. But most people buy logos to flex, to close gaps of insecurity. And so that's what worries me. Because if you're just into a little money and you decide to buy a Rolex, because actually you're insecure and you're not confident, and you need that flex to rub elbows with me or to hit on that girl, then you've got other work that you need to do. And that money's not gonna be well spent. It's gonna be a short term high. And then you're gonna be in like a weird place. And so money's a, it's an exposure of your truth. So anyway, back to investing to stay on track. Shit, you understand. I like it. Tarzan, Gary taught you a trick a few weeks ago. And immediately you got like 600,000, I don't even know the number, 600,000 likes or something. This makes me so happy. This was like two weeks ago. And it's like, this feels like very gratifying to me. It's like instant validation to giving good strategy. It's not even a trick. It's like tag me in the screenshot. And he was like, look, 2.6 million views, 18 million views, 12 million views. And it was the same week that you told him. You have a lot of valid points. And the way my brain set up, you break stuff down really well and understand it. And what algorithm junkies. So we try to figure out where, what hits, what unlocks it, what kicks it. Underpriced attention, the arbitrage, the opportunity. Yes. So you kicked off that, you know, front, front space of still photo with the text and then the video that follows. Genius. Yeah, it's funny for everybody to give a clarity. Instagram's tougher now, supply and demand. It's not like it was when we were kicking in 2014, you know? Like there's more, I mean, a lot of the demand went to TikTok and YouTube shorts, but the supply is super up. Yesterday, more people posted on Instagram than ever before. So it gets harder. So you're looking for what I call strategic organic content. Like what are the, what's the organic content move? Meaning, of course there's ads, but what's the respectful proper, back to like getting buff, right? Like there's steroids when there's putting in the work and eating protein in those ratios. And listen, I'm not interested in, I know this makes you so over the fucking place. You know, like, and yeah, I was pumped. You caught me at a good time because it was a revelation for me only 30 days earlier. Like we're constantly testing. We have, what I think I do well, that I want more people to do well is I have the humility for it to bomb. I don't fear somebody coming to Gary V's page and seeing 80,000 views, you've got 14, like you suck. Like I'm like, well, I ain't, you suck too. Like what are we talking about? I don't know. See you tomorrow. Right, so we take a lot of creative risks. Most people can't get out of posting the same shit over and over because they need the same results even though it's declining. So we find shit. And the one we found on this one was instead of just posting the video which everybody's been doing for a while now, first post an image that kind of previews what the video is gonna be as a video. So it's a two post carousel image first video second. And I'm so happy you're seeing results. And the reason I'm saying it out loud here is, and you know this about me Dan, I'm weird when it comes to someone who hacks. I go from finding it to immediately telling everyone. Like all my best buds are like, yo, can't you just sit on this for like a month? Like don't you, and I'm like, nobody's taking from me. Like I'm gonna get mine regardless. And I like that people, it feels nice. Like it feels nice to be admired when you're helping. Going to your last part charity feels nice. Like, you know, when you don't have anything and then you get money. You really like, especially in the beginning, you're like, yo, I'm not sure I can give this away. Like, you know, like I remember being young and hearing like Bill Gates and all those guys were giving away 99%. I was like, yo, that shit's crazy. Now I understand, especially with kids. You know, you don't wanna leave, you know, leaving kids, those characters leaving kids billions of dollars, it's actually gonna make them unhappy. So, but, yeah, you know, before we go into charity, the biggest charity is intellectual generosity. And I know I'm very good at my craft. And I know I'm at the top of the game. And I'm proud. I watch people far less capable than me, hold everything to themselves, scarcity mindset, wanting to pass you or you or me or you and followers. And that's their fucking, I don't see it that way. I get, I looked at someone's account today, who I was like, whoa. And I was like pumped to their exploit. Like, I don't know. Like I don't know how to boo. I don't know how to boo in football. I hate everybody. But you know what's so funny? Actually, I'll make this point before we get to the last part. Do you know that being a Jets fan, this is real talk, actually makes me understand people. Meaning in real life, I have this almost borderline delusion, although I know it's fully grounded in practicality, optimism. I have no envy. I have no jealousy. I have no anger. I have no darkness. I really don't. It's kind of scary. It's a fucking blessing. But in football, I have all that. I'm jealous of Patriot fans. I'm sad that we didn't get Patrick Mahomes when we could have drafted him. And it's all this resentment. 40 years of pain. And it lashes out. Like I'm not... I'm really scared somebody's gonna fill me at a Jets game one day. It's gonna ruin the whole fucking... The whole nice image is finished. I'm not nice. And the people who are listening, I'm really not. There's some inside jokes with my friends. I once yelled at this 80-year-old man. It was really inappropriate. Like I yell at kids. Like I'm un-tilted. I feel that pain. I feel that anger. I wanted... Taylor Swift was sitting right above me at the Jets Chiefs game. I was mad at that box. I adore Ryan Reynolds. But he was there. I was like, fuck you, Ryan. But for real though. And he's the fucking best. But for those three hours, I want to rip his face off. And it's a pretty face. So I'm like, man, that's how people feel in real life. I treat Jets football, but that's a silly thing. That's football. That's entertainment. That's escapism. People treat shit like that in real life. The world is trying to make us more tribal, which makes us hate each other more. I'm kind of very team human. Like color, skin, race, gender, religion. I struggle with that shit. I don't want to hate anybody. Why? Especially when I don't know you. And if I know you and you're a bad person, I don't hate you. I feel bad for you. I have compassion. I have empathy. So anyway, I think about that shit. So two parts on the charity side of it. Yes. And then you mentioned, Gary Vee is going to keep building companies. You've already got like 2,500 employees for main and media and all that stuff. And all these investments, like, you ended up becoming a multi, multi, multi billionaire. And who knows, maybe even crazier or more. What happens for the kids? I don't know. The truth is, I don't know. Meaning, I definitely, as I've done, started doing estate planning in the last decade and not where I thought I was going to be 10 years ago. Meaning, I do feel uncomfortable leaving tons of money for two children. I think it's a little scary. Of course. I really do. But then you're, especially from an immigrant, like where I'm from, it's real family doubt. So then you get into like, is that, it's a very complex thing. Here's what I would say, a couple things. Real talk, everyone. You earned it, you decide. Don't let me, this whole like judging each other shit. Like, just tune out everyone. You earned it. You wanna burn it? You burn it. You wanna give it to dolphins? Give it to dolphins. Not the Miami dolphins. The animals, right? You wanna give all of it just to your kid and not a dollar to charity. Mazel tov. To me, I really think that people are, I think we're really bad at judging and I think we need to be accountable. So to answer you directly, I'm not sure. I definitely have come to realize, especially if I'm keep on this trajectory. Look, my point of view is this. Do you know what it's like to get a million dollars? Right. That's insane. Like if I had that at, like at 18, I would have been like, it would have been over. I might have the jets and the nicks by now. So if your kids are capable, they're not gonna need a whole lot. Plus, for a lot of kids, it fucks them up. I've met a lot of rich kids now because of my life the last 15 years. Man, I'm not sure who's worse. Like I actually genuinely believe if you could be born with little, but have a happy house, or born with a lot and have an unhappy house, that's not even a fight. But I think it's even scarier. I think if you've got a lot and you're in a happy house and you got a little and you're in a happy house, the little and happy house person won because they've been taught from the get that money doesn't buy happiness. Whereas the rich kid might not know. They might just think, well, we're happy because we got a driver and a private plane. And so the answer is I don't know. The answer is I'm sure it will ebb and flow. The other thing I don't know is when am I going? What's happening in my life? Let me talk about things that people don't talk enough about. Let me give you a scenario while people are listening and judging. What if one of my grandchildren has special needs? You know, like I don't think we do enough of this. Like, do you know real talk why I don't judge anyone? Like really, like actually, I just don't know what the fuck's going on in life. I'm watching everybody walk around the internet and society just throwing nothing but judgment. I wish we, like, you know, people like, fuck this guy, he throws shade. Shades easy, judgment's crazy. Telling people what they should be doing. You know nothing. You know nothing. You should post about this. Do you know that if a person posts about that, they have death threats? You should do this with your money. Okay, well, you should do this with it. Like, I don't understand. So, you know, I think for me, I don't feel, I mean, I have a will and it's split up at this point to kids and charity, but I may change it and like, cause things will change and we'll see. But I do, let me say one thing. Charity, most of my life, so I would say 97 cents on the dollar of everything I've done in my life has been incredibly private. Because I think that's how it's taught. Like, you know, it's funny, like, probably one of the reasons I don't flex a lot is the same reason I don't really make a lot of my charity work public. I think there's something in the way that my parents saw the world that became my framework, right? It's like, keep quiet in some ways. But I don't judge. You know, let me phrase, I think there was a time a decade ago that I was a little cynical to people that were overly loud about donating. You know, my Jersey Street bullshit radar would go off. But I've come to realize like, I don't wanna be a judge either. And you know, if you know, you know. You're like, okay, they're using that as a disguise for the bad shit, that happens. But there are just other people that like, get real pride in that. And more importantly, they're motivating others to do it. And so, yeah, I mean, I think- I'm very public, but I don't say amounts. I say, I show them how they can do charity. Yeah, and honestly, even like amounts, like, you know, I think it goes, I've started to change my point of view on that. And this is what's fun about, let me say something real quick to the kids, which by the way is everyone, if a 99 year old grandma is watching your kid, you get to change your mind. Right? You like that one, right? Right, cause you've changed your mind on shit. I've changed my, like, you get to change your mind. And so, I'm glad I'm so happy kids have like, by the way, maybe if I was 14 and listened to this podcast, maybe I wouldn't have had that point of view as a 20 and 30 year old about charity, right? And maybe I did leave an opportunity to bring awareness to charity, water and pencils of promise and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation and reform. Maybe I've left too much attention on the table by maybe having too much pride in the humility in the class that comes along with not flexing it. You know, like, so it's, I mean this to everybody, like give yourself the grace to change your mind. I want people, the reason I post about toy drives and tipping dinners and homeless backpacks is so people can replicate it and thousand, thousand, thousand people replicate it. And so when you talk about, I even heard about pencil of promise because you weren't posting about it, but I just heard about it. And then all of a sudden I became obsessed with it because of that. And that was a fun one for me, cause I was a bad student and I'm a famously bad student, but I think about friction. In Ghana, it's not like America with the education system where we all go and it doesn't work for half of us cause we are creative or entrepreneurial. When you look at the math that if you build a school, one of those places, like what the trajectory of that, people here talk about generational wealth, they are, you put a school, it's generational wealth. They go from living a life of a dollar a day to like, fuck, in Haiti it's a dollar a day. People are living on. Yeah, bro, we're lost out here. We're worried about all sorts of dumb shit. We grew up thinking it's rude to talk about money. Obviously here at the podcast, we think it's rude to not talk about money because we need your friends, family, followers to know about taxes, salary, loans, rent, how to make money, invest money, save money, 401ks and everything between. We just need to have these discussions. So talk to your friends, family, followers about money, ask questions, research it. By the way, real quick on that, chat GPT everyone. Google changed the world. Chat GPT, you can ask that bot. Very, very specific questions. Hey, I'm a plumber. I make 39,000 a year. I get to save $1,000 a year. What should I do? Enter. You would be blown away what AI can do. You can be very specific. You can't do that on Google. Hey, I have $18,000 in debt from this credit card company. I'm paying 7.3, like, did, did, did, did, did, like, get, start using AI for your advantage. Not something you heard about or demonized or don't understand. Don't understand is unacceptable. I don't get it. Okay, Google it. YouTube it. If you're like me and can't read for shit and listen. Like, so, you know, for a lot of people wanting to learn about money, could you imagine having real info? Like, could you imagine sitting down with somebody that knew most things? It's not a cool way to think about, hey, like, imagine sitting down with fucking Yoda and getting all the answers. Like, just, just, just literally type in shit. Be super specific. You'll learn how to start using AI, which may change your trajectory, and you can start answering shit for yourself. ["Side Story"]
