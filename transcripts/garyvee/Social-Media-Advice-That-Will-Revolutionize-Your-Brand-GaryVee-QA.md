The thing that I'm most worried about is that you are all talking yourselves out of doing what you feel in your stomach because you think there's a better way. Today I just want to do something like bubbly and good. Do that. And then when you do something that you feel in your stomach, what I'm scared about is it doesn't do as well as your other content and you give up after one post and you archive it and try to act like it didn't happen. I think you should do things you want to do. You're in your 90, you're gonna be sad if you didn't do the thing that's in your stomach. A lot of you are scared to do new things because you won't get as many likes or you're scared to lose your audience instead of realizing you're gonna gain a bigger audience. Do your thing. I have a good following on my personal page and I there are two separate pages. So do you think I should be putting them into one? No. How do I go about it? Good news everyone. The algorithm change of the last three years has taken this completely out of the equation. No more thinking. It's individual pieces of content. You could start a third one and post a good piece of content there. And I mean I have big pages too. And literally, I think everyone here knows this because you see other people with like 500 followers and you're like how do they get 13 million on that view? The whole game changed. And so I wouldn't overthink that. The following is now a vanity thing more than, I believe in the next 24 months they're gonna eliminate even your followers as a reason for the content to be seen. It's crazy how this is all going. And so I would just focus on making very good content depending on what page. You can even create a third page. You create another page called Gratitude, Gratitude, Gratitude and post there for learnings and testings. I do that with different pages. So it's now down to the individual content, not the page. My question for you is on threads. Okay. So threads is this hot new spot I've been growing like super organically. It's been fun and refreshing as a creator honestly. You just get out there and just feel what I guess it used to be like. Yeah. Y'all like create. And so my question for you is I feel like I have a good rhythm now on really kind of maximizing what my posting schedule will be using chat, GVT and I'm getting really good engagement. But now what? Like how are people monetizing it? Like I keep seeing like these spreads bonuses, but to me that seems like smoke and mirror. Yeah. So I think monetizing comes in so many shapes and sizes, everyone. Obviously, I think you all are aware of this. The size and scale that you need to be at in views to actually make your monetization from the platforms giving you a share of ad revenue is very large. Like, you know, there's a lot of strong people here, me included, but all of us combined, we don't have the reach of, you know, a tenth of what Mr. Beast is getting to be able to get those kind of real dollars. I think monetization comes outside of the platforms. So you're building reputation. You're building brand. And then you're able to create monetization outside of it. So if you're getting a cadence of organic growth through threads while everybody's looking elsewhere, I think you double down on that because the attention is the most valuable thing. And then there's a million ways, books and clothes and product and consulting and speaking. And I mean, you could literally go on forever. And I think all of you are educated enough to know that and new things will pop up of ways to monetize. But I think, Tina, if you've got a pattern going and it's working, especially with something like threads where you're basically outflanking people, not realizing that there's action there, I would go hard. Okay. My thought is anytime that my wife and I have had success, we've been super laser focused. When is it time to just focus on one thing? And when is the time to have more ideas and go out? Because I'm always ideas. She's always focused and... Makes you guys a good team. There's a lot of answers to this first. And this is I'm really glad we're doing this. First, you need to decide what's successes. Let me be very clear. One of the reasons I'm challenging to follow if you don't get this kind of time with me is I am not trying to maximize fame or money. I'm trying to maximize me being happy. And so when I do things that fail miserably and I lose money, time, and effort, I'm not sad. I'm happy because I did it. That is not what most people do. It's also the luxury after doing it well for 25 years. So to your wife's point, Josh, I focused on just building Wine Library for my dad the first 12 years of my career. Right? And then when I was building VaynerMedia, I mean, there's something for the hardest core Gary Vee fans. They know this one very nerdy fact about my career. There's almost no content from me in 2006 to today. Literally 18 years. There's almost daily content from me. Except from 2012 to 14, there's very little. There's very little. Some public speeches here and there. I was so laser focused on building the foundation of VaynerMedia, I put Gary Vee on the shelf. And that's because I sensed that it was time to focus because I wanted to build a foundation that would allow me to do more. So by the time I popped back up in 2014 with the Ask Gary Vee show, I had a couple of people able to help me that worked at VaynerMedia. Prior to that, 2006 to 2012, I did everything myself. So, you know, I think for all of you, this is going to make sense. There's moments when you have to hit while the iron is hot, whether you're growing, whether you're growing your fan space, whether your deals are coming in. What I do, Josh, is I respond to what I'm feeling. So if I feel like there's something, and look, how do you tell somebody like Josh, like what the feeling is? It's hard to say that. But I will say this, and I'm saying this for everyone, you also have to know what you're doing this for. I literally today on the elevator coming into my office was reminiscing about early wine library when my life was simple. I was making $48,000 a year. It was simple. I was opening a store and closing a store every day. That's what I did. And it was awesome. And I love what I do now, but I love that too. And so, you know, I think one thing that I hope all of you, because all of you have gotten to some place of public success, I hope you have the humility and the kindness for yourself to know when you don't need to grow. As a matter of fact, this has been a year like that for me. I've not really grown the Gary Vee thing as much. I've been very focused on VFRIENDS and VaynerX. And my personal life, to be honest. Kids, my personal life. And I'm okay with that. I saw today somebody post how many views they got this last month on Instagram. It was their post. And it was 20% more than I got this last month. And this is somebody that I know for a fact, like learned from me seven years ago. I was happy for them, not sad for me. And so I think eliminating envy, eliminating jealousy, realizing that nobody else's life has anything to do with yours, saying things like they caught, like I hope none, I hope all of you can get out of your vocabulary, things like, oh, they copied me and now they're growing. Or they got like all these things that I know slip into the mindset of like what we all do for a living. Nobody's taking away from you. And if you're not growing, it's okay to take a breath. Some days, some weeks, some months, and even some years are just a reset. Or you're focused on something else. I am very professionally obsessed. I am super ambitious. I'm super into this. I love what I do. But having grace for yourself is also important. And so for example, if she's the straight man and you're the creative force, as long as you guys are over communicating and not creating resentment or tension, just keep communicating and it will, and you know this, it probably already has. It ebbs and flows. It ebbs and flows. Some days, some weeks, some months, and some years are better than others. But being, here's a big one, but being comfortable with being uncomfortable is a real talent. Like right? Like not being able to figure out how to grow for six months and being okay with that and enjoying the challenge or at least being neutral while you go through the muckery. It's important. Sweet, thank you so much Gary. I'm very new to the parenting world. My little baby is five weeks old. Wow. Very new. Congrats. I started in music and built a lot of my audience that way and that's still part of my life. But I've moved into more of the lifestyle and travel space and obviously now this whole new world. And just letting my audience into this process, the good and the bad so far has really connected with a lot of them. And I was just curious what you've learned in this space. And if you see a lane here, because I feel like everything was super curated and then it was super stripped down and like raw. Yeah, I think that, I'm sorry, go ahead Maddie. I just, I feel like there's a balance in that and I don't want to just be focusing on negative things. We'll also include people in on the process. So I'm just curious if you've seen any sort of need. I watch it all the time. The answer is everything works and everything doesn't work. This is real, right? Like, and I've watched people go through the ebbs and flows, right? Like right now there's so much data that supports that people that are over curate are not doing as well as they used to. But then everybody who loves curating and making everything look polished and the grid look good. See somebody explode who only does that and then they want to gravitate towards it because they like the aesthetics. Then, you know, like, and so I need everyone to hear this nice and slow. There's no right answer. There's right answers for you at right times. And so if you wake up and be like, man, I love even the way you asked the question. Man, I've let people into a lot of the challenges. Today, I just want to do something like bubbly and good. Do that. The thing that I'm most worried about is that you are all talking yourselves out of doing what you feel in your stomach. Because you think there's a better way. And then when you do something that you feel in your stomach, what I'm scared about is it doesn't do as well as your other content and you give up after one post and you archive it and try to act like it didn't happen. The level of insecurity. Please watch what I'm doing. I think you should do things you want to do. I think when you're 90, you're going to be upset. Every one of you, I just saw, I just saw Adrian just shake his head like, do your thing. Because I'm telling you when you're 90, you're going to be sad if you didn't do the thing that's in your stomach. I know a lot of you from afar. I know a lot of you have built a foundation to be able to do more things. But a lot of you are scared to do new things because you won't get as many likes or you're scared to lose your audience instead of realizing you're going to gain a bigger audience. I was the biggest wine personality in America in 2011. But I wanted to talk about business and mindset too. I keep putting out all sorts of stuff. I'm me and I happily leave shit that doesn't do well on my page. Please remember that you're not in high school anymore. Here's how I'll say this. You know how like 100 years ago people didn't know a lot of things we now know? I mean like real stuff like penicillin and like don't smoke and like just real shit, right? I always think about what in 50 years are people going to know that we sit here today and don't know? Some things are obvious like drinking out of plastic bottles is like pretty obviously going to end up being like no, you shouldn't do that. You know that I can like wrap my head around. I'll give you one that I don't think people have figured out yet. In 75 years it will be common knowledge that your gut is the primary brain and your brain is secondary. I think we've all been taught to not listen to our gut, our intuition. I actually think intuition is the answer to every quiz. So Maddie what I would say is like if you feel it, don't use your secondary brain to talk you out of it. It does that a lot. I would argue that it does that a lot for almost everybody. And I will tell you not that I've been right or all the time, but the reason I am so calm always in the scheme of things is because I listen to it. And I think, especially with math around social, all of you are all of you. I promise you are overthinking it. Remember how you got here was by not overthinking it. Most people don't realize the thing that's going to make you grow more is the thing that got you here. But then you get to somewhere and you start to overanalyze. So intuition, okay? Some days are good, some days are bad. Don't hold it back. And also don't share something you don't want to share. I think again some of you followed me for a long time. I think you know this. I don't share my personal life. I don't want to. But I don't judge other people that do. I think it's awesome if that's right for them. But like don't do what you think you need to do. Right? Do what is good for you and also be thinking about the future. You know I think again since a lot of you do a lot with kids, pay attention to your child. There may be a time pretty early on before five or six where you get a sense of should they be public? Some kids rock with it. Other kids you may decide even though your kid is the one that the audience likes the most, it's your kid and you can tell they shouldn't be out and about. So like be strong. My question is kind of based around what you came on kind of suggesting too is it has to do with getting brand deals and just kind of how how do you what suggestions do you have to get noticed or to really start firing some of those off? I see at times like certain content creators will just start booming with a bunch of them. We know one after another and it's just like we have a pretty large following but it's just been more difficult trying to figure out brand deals. I don't know if it's style. Is it harder to figure out how to get them incoming or harder to figure out when they get to you what to do that works for both of you. Incoming. We don't get offers for brand deals like we hear other people saying that they get all these offers from people and that's just not something we get very often. Yep and do you ever reach out? We've been starting to do a little more how reach. Yeah Dan I think honestly brother I think it's a layup for you. Do either one of you like the idea of spending 30 minutes to an hour listening to music and DMing brands and being like hey if you ever want to check us out let us know? Yeah I think I think I can settle into that. Yeah brother I think it's I mean for me it's the most fun. I'm aware that it's not fun for everyone but I'm telling you right now it's pretty like I don't know it's like therapy for me it's like having an hour where I like and by the way it's what I do when I say hello to some of you like the reason you hear from me is like I literally am on a flight and I'm just like you know what this is like more fun for me I don't do it for brand deals but it's what I tell everyone to do and it works and Tina's right you can use chat gbt but believe it or not that's like the next step in my opinion literally you DMing every single product that's in your house and saying hey Twizzlers just wanted you know me and the fam love your stuff hey head and shoulders just want you to know like you would be stunned stunned if you literally just started with everything your family uses and just say like big fans if you want to get real fancy like if you pour yourself a bowl of fucking Cheerios and take a photo and DM them like you have 700,000 followers on Instagram it's going to catch the attention of brand managers and agencies so I just I just think this is one of those scenarios where you got to go out and take it and I think again like working out like like like meditating like watching tv like reading a book like everybody here has different things they like to do if god willing you can get into a place where you enjoy that hour a day you will see unlimited deals in six months oh man I appreciate it you're welcome thank you Dan real quick like that fun photo you had with you guys drinking the icy right like if you just DM that to them and be like we love your stuff but you could also take that photo and be like you know we love we're an ice cream family and you could just literally go from top you know literally from jerry's all the way down like you could just hit them all okay like you had that line like we need to do it act on it you're just talking about like DMing on Instagram yeah like literally DMing like 40 different ice cream brands one night like and like and it's like you could literally go into chat you have you used chat gbt yet yes good you can literally go in there and be like can you give me the instagram handles to the top 25 ice cream brands in america they'll give it to you boom you're off and running it's really it's I mean again I love business development so it's the most fun and it is literally literally back to like crafting a message when you walk when you're fortunate enough like you are to have this many followers literally just a DM that says we love your products over here keep it up literally that you said something maybe a year and a half ago online and we were I was dealing with you know just a lot of just people you know you don't ask for you know a lot of followers you know they kind of just like gravitate towards your page and then I was dealing with like you were saying posting what I want to post versus what they want to see and then I found out the balance of the two and now I'm leaning more so towards what I want to post because one thing you said a while back was um don't be afraid to take a break for two weeks or two months because you'll always come back stronger and you know I took a break for a while because my brain needed it good for you we came back and then it was kind of like okay they people missed people will miss your presence um but what is your taking that I'm knowing that that was a year and a half ago what is your take on disappearing for a while I believe in it the most I mean somebody wants I have a very viral clip from in my world where kid comes up to me at a Super Bowl radio row and he goes what's your take on health and business and I'm like well if you're dead you're out of business and people just you know and so similarly if you're burnt out right if you're just like and everyone gets there I brother when I tell you there are very few people row on in life that like working the way I like it and even I seven 12 days a year wake up and I'm like I don't want to do this anymore right like so and I'm very aware that I'm in like outer space fortunate and I know many more people struggle I'm this I mean my podcast the Ask Gary V show T with Gary V daily V Wine Library TV I've stopped things I don't want to do all the time regardless of how well they do and if you don't want to post for a day or a year then that's going to be important because it like play it out I always say this to my friends and like people in these moments play it out so the worst downside is you're out for so long you lost your moment right I know what everyone's worried about but like no level of money because that's you know forget about silly things like vanity there's no level of money that's worth the alternative that you stayed the course and you really hit rock bottom I don't think people understand the capacity of a human when they become unhappy like when you get to real unhappiness you start to do silly things to cope and those things are very damaging and less money is not very damaging you just live a less bougie lifestyle you know like I don't think people get it and so I'm pumped that you've been able to taste that the fact that you've been able to get off the treadmill and are on the other side you should be golden really even though you like any other human are still going to be worried about the momentum loss but you've got to do you because those two right there they're not going to care about how much is in your bank account in 15 years they're going to care about your relationship with them they I promise people have it super twisted I've unlimited trust fund baby friends they're not that happy like you know and we have to focus on that for real so being able to be busy and in real world stuff and making content and being blessed to be able to be consistent with all of that also being a father yes how have you navigated being so busy yeah ever since 2014 even working as much yeah and still being present still being by I'll tell you how by not beating myself up like work-life balance by who's standard who gets to the side I guarantee if we do a survey right now everyone's got a different answer and oh by the way I know plenty of parents that come home at five o'clock every night and don't pay attention for shit about their like what are you deciding so Nate I think it's about effort by holding myself accountable by not being delusional that I'm choosing work over the kids and I'm making up some excuse and by living a mantra if I can I will right like like we're all living different lives and sometimes and by the way let me go fully you're also allowed to be a human being you're allowed to this is real for every parent you're allowed to miss a recital or a game or a class thing for something that is either a fire at your work or even let me blow your mind here you just chose to do something for yourself you're allowed it is not a hundred zero game I love my dad the most we have a crazy good relationship he showed up for nothing in my entire life not one thing not one video game not one parent teacher conference he didn't know anything about my childhood nothing there's no perfect system you got to just do the best you can and you've got to react to the truth of the situation in fact I would argue that a lot of kids are incredibly depressed and insecure today because their parents did go to everything and they over coddled everything I think a little adversity I think little Johnny not having his dad come to the big game is a shockingly good thing for little Johnny not always can't feel neglected but I think a little balance in the force would be nice so I think Nate by knowing that you're trying and caring about your family and doing the best you can appreciate that thank you as building my speaking career how to just get on those bigger stages by by filming your talks on smaller stages and posting them on youtube in full form and as many pieces of content for social from those talks on social period end of story keep it going all right I spoke for free at scale just to get the content yeah like as a better I'm going to say something even crazier most of what I say yes to today ironically I did as Dustin's filming right now we know like one of our problems in Gary Vee land right now is I'm busy building v-friends and VaynerMedia so I'm not speaking as much I'm not doing tea with Gary Vee I'm not doing the podcast as much as original it's clips you guys know you get a sense so I literally went to Orlando yesterday I said yes to a speech strictly to see if I could get some new stuff out of me for content think about that that's the value for you yeah and for you the value will be more people will see you the reason I got to the biggest stages is people found my speeches on the internet in short and long form and then decided we need Gary that will be the same for you based on the merit of your and the quality of your speeches and clips awesome my question today Gary is that so a year and a half ago I started my social media account at the listening team tell us to share what we love for so long so I did that and I focused on just providing value nothing else not asking for anything and then a month ago I launched a course that's doing really well but I struggle with the fine line between um embedding talking about my course into my content but doing so in a peaceful way I try to do it naturally but I don't want to turn off all of my followers that I gained from I I mean get your profile perfect here's what I mean by that your bio should be your selling engine and your content should be leading into it right so Jenna what's your Instagram? ABA naturally right so already you're doing the right thing video course with the link down but you've got four you've got four you're selling five different things uh just one there's two courses just on two courses I'm sorry when I say selling you're sending me to five different things your amazon store your youtube channel right okay right so when I look at this what I'm trying to think about is and I'll make this for everyone what I'm trying to figure out is like how this bio the more you can make your bio remarkable to sell the thing of the moment that you most want to sell the more you don't have to sell in your content okay so Dustin maybe doesn't even know why I always do this Dustin knows on my team a lot of I'm always trying to get down to only having one link and the team always wants to have three because I have 97 things that are going on and like sometimes I rarely like control the controllers I just tell them to but sometimes they'll wake up and like I'll take down the link like I will take it down yeah it's because if I want people to know about my cartoon I want them to know for this month about the cartoon and I don't even want them to have to click right you all know what I'm saying right like you've got to click that extra link let me do it here so it's easier right this extra link to scroll down I just want it there because there's friction think about how I think about friction because you have to click that to then get the other things and click that that's two clicks whereas if you just have it here it's one click think about the nerdom I'm going with on all of you right now so getting your bio or you know what else you can do that crushes that you will love put out your content like your good content that you're putting out but then at the like in this design or oh I'm sorry in this design either in the bottom or at the end of this clip I'm going to let this clip play out because obviously I'm answering for everyone at the end of that clip or on the loop you can add your ps like literally at the bottom you can have like a banner like right where your name is right now on the screen that could just say ps link in bio to my course now it's just making people aware but you don't have to say it okay is it okay to do that in like most of my videos yeah I mean I think you can do the end card like at the end if you're like learn about my new course or ps check out my bio or click the link in my bio if you want to learn more like people will accept that you have something to sell to your point if you do it with tact and taste there's little maneuvers versus just like every fucking video and be like son up for you know you don't want to be qvc I get perfect does that make sense little tweaks yes yes very much thank you you're welcome the other thing you can do is go on a podcast or where you're allowed to plug it they'll set you up for that okay there's also that like investing more to go to other places do you know what I mean we're that audience like you know smaller and it's okay if it's smaller podcasts I back to soul's thing I prefer it because you can get clips from it too right like it's smaller like listen you're not going to wake up out of bed and go right to Joe Rogan's show you know what I mean like it's just yeah and I know you don't I know you don't and so like when people ask me they're like so what do I do I'm like start going on smaller shows Joe Rogan's first stand up had three people in the audience you know so anyway all right Johnson fam what's your favorite movie my favorite movie is Star Wars Star Wars yeah yeah but we like the same movie that's awesome so we've been on youtube we're going on like nine years now I know that you I want us that day to go and VidCon like I remember brother so that was super cool to like be invited to super thankful one of the things that we have a question on is we've been on youtube and since youtube switched over a couple years ago when they started not paying as much for youtube kids I'm curious as why how you're monetizing this show on youtube kids because we currently do roughly like 40 to 50 million views and a lot of those come from youtube kids and our assets season out of that yeah I uh I don't view this as a monetizable asset within the youtube environment I view it as a brand building exercise for all the things that are going to happen outside of youtube okay great and I think for you I think for you and as you know like I know your journey from a far well and I know the journey very well because I'm in this business this is why what you're seeing from Logan Paul and Charlie D'Amelio and like you you have as much permission as anybody to make a kid's toothpaste that could be a hundred million dollar business now that's a totally different business but to remind the two of you you didn't do family video vlogging 10 years ago either and you figured it out and so yeah this is why you're going to see a lot of people go into product look I think you already know the answer right your ability to post-produce creative from the long form cartoon and produce original creative to social that takes advantage of the algorithms creating awareness is the whole game as far as AI you know I think of it as a thinking partner right now more so than making the actual creative though that will continue to advance and so and the most important AI right now in the world for everyone here is the AI that powers how the algorithms actually work understanding human behavior and like understanding that's becoming more and more of the game so there's nothing too out of the ordinary on that Garrett other than for me where are the opportunities I'll give you an example one of the biggest opportunities for every family and every individual here is Snapchat spotlight so Snapchat spotlight is TikTok is YouTube shorts is Instagram and I have a funny feeling almost no one here is taking it very serious and I would argue many of the people here and let's remember what this room is this is a winner's room there are people are winning in this room I would I'm pretty sure many of the people in this room aren't even posting on it or have an account on it so to remind all of you of how you won you went on a platform that had a lot of attention whether you started on YouTube and then went somewhere else or you started on tiktok and went to YouTube you went on a platform that had attention you figured out how to make content so people for free saw it and then you refined your skills and then if you were smart you started to try to do that on more than one platform my question to you is are you dominant on all of them what makes me wildly unique many people here have way more views than me more subscribers on different platform but nobody here has two million followers or more on every platform and when I say every platform I mean LinkedIn I have five million I probably I'm going to guess this I have more LinkedIn followers than everybody in this call combined times a multiple yet everybody on this platform can literally post the same I know I'm a businessman I get it I know where LinkedIn started LinkedIn is you it LinkedIn is Facebook friends every one of you and I know what you all do can post your actual videos on LinkedIn and slightly change the copy just a copy that supports it by knowing it's a business environment like literally at its most Kelly M can just say need two minutes away from your shitty job watch this that's it that's already contextualized what she does for LinkedIn so the biggest thing I want from you Garrett honestly is to keep doing what you're doing but I would want to know which like I'll give you one that actually is even more serious where's everybody out on Facebook in here actually I want everybody to do me a favor because it's going to help everybody from a one to ten going hard making content trying to figure out the algorithm like giving a fuck where are you one to ten right now on Facebook proper put a number in put your number in the chat so you know it's fun to see all the different numbers right I'm sure for some of the people that are two they're looking at an 11 now obviously Jenna with going after parents like there's a lot of logic like Brittany I could see it but I'm telling you I understand a lot of these numbers every one of you have to understand that Facebook is Instagram is YouTube they're all kind of the same you think they're not but you're wrong I don't know what else to tell you like I'll give you an example my fastest growing audience on Facebook right now is 20 to 30 year olds it baffles me I don't need I've never found a kid 20 to 30 on earth who's on Facebook but they are they just go once a week or they're using Facebook marketplace to get a free couch or they're part of a Facebook group that's mental health issues for 27 year olds like but then they consume a little bit of the algorithm so Garrett obviously as you can tell I'm answering you but I'm answering everybody here the by far the thing I would do because you know what to do I know that from afar it's just and I want you to dominate every platform yeah yeah I'm going to answer Johnson's fam's question because it's going to help a lot of people and then we'll go if our Facebook created years ago but it seems to be dead should we create a new one here's the wildest shit of all and I think all of you're going to resonate with this the answer is sure yes no maybe but here's the actual answer I believe all these platforms are dangerously close within the next three years to get to a place where it won't matter how many followers you have every individual piece of creative has its own algorithm like all it is is now the single piece of content so I would probably test it to be honest with you Johnson fam on that one start another one with a tweak maybe you decide I'm sure the two of you have like some creative ideas the kids have gotten older you've evolved like there might be like a little spin-off the behind this the bts of what you do on YouTube or maybe a vet you know I'm not close enough to your content to not know there might be a meme going on in your world right now around eating cereal maybe you just do cereal content there and on YouTube you're like all our deep or cereal like there's a lot you can be very it's creativity you can see what I just came up with in two seconds right so live shopping I have no idea how many of you have started selling on TikTok shop or whatnot I'm talking QVC live shopping if this is not on your radar like for real for real I'm telling you right now live shopping is where social media was in 2012 meaning people knew it I'm sure everyone here knows what TikTok shop is or whatnot like or like Amazon live or eBay like I'm sure it's sure you've heard of it or you might even like fully know that it's the biggest thing in China like I'm sure it's on your radar you've seen a viral TikTok video of the woman that just does the purses and made 40 trillion like but I'm telling all of you you will love some of you really did start your careers by something I said or a book I wrote you already like me this might really be where you really love me and build like a statue in your house live shopping is a huge deal so that's different than what I told the Johnson fam to be the product this is more being Walmart being Amazon like selling stuff like I believe the Johnson fam if they live sold for four hours a day could do eight figures selling stuff to buy in your house shampoo it's coming so I want you to get educated okay just wanted to tell everybody like live shopping if I would the one that I think will really catch your attention does everybody know what whatnot is please download what not jack put the URL as a matter of fact oh this is even better I've been doing the trading cards so some of you know that the big thing going on in v-friends is the Pokemon cards of it all like just to give you context we sold $100,000 worth of trading cards in six hours on what not the other day but ironically this Monday upcoming I'm doing a conference room clearance sale for like hoodies and t-shirts so it'll be perfect for you to watch because it's more broad I'll have jack send you an email to the bookmark tune in to learn because you know it's always like watch what I do not what I say you'll get a feel but honestly even I I'm just getting going and I'm innovating I'm built for it watch what's going on on what not on some of the other channels you've got to I need you all to understand social shop live shopping live shopping all right not affiliate not tick tock affiliate live shopping qvc you win it all right Michelle we feature creators influence or celebrities we do red carpet events too and I also own a marketing agency vented marketing for 23 years always been known in the Hudson Valley the kipsey area as like the guru of marketing and I've always followed your footsteps so everyone's like hey Michelle how do you know this I'm like I can't tell you but it's my little secret thank you Gary for all these years and being my go-to guy but truly you know looking to branch out of this area I'm looking to branch out of this area I've been doing red carpets and been out there and I feel like my personality is electric you know every time I'm with other hosts and interviewers I feel like I stand out and I didn't know if I could ever compete in that world now that I have some confidence and I'm ready to do it we've been doing a lot more on social following throwing a lot came to be con and met so many people so thank you so much and you know I'm really looking to how to become the Oprah the Ryan Seacrest and build that real brand online with the podcast with iHeart Media so they've given me a lot of leverage to knock on doors and you know being able to have that backup just to get out there has been huge and got me into the VMAs the Grammy Super Bowl things like that but I want to really take my brand to the next level and become that go-to interviewer how much how much how much content are you putting out on social a week right now we're doing about five videos a week of clips from the podcast and two or three from red carpets and and so if you're so you're doing about eight original piece of content five to eight and when you say per week right per week and what platforms are you posting that on instagram, tiktok, youtube and mostly youtube shorts but the longer episodes on youtube like the regular all right so I want you to expand into LinkedIn, Facebook, Snapchat, Spotlight, ASAP, ASAP, Twitter too everybody Twitter's about to take a hard turn into like all these two okay I know that Twitter's a nigmund a lot of ways but Twitter video and Twitter algorithm and like Twitter's gonna be they all Snapchat Spotlight's gonna wake up in the next two to three years and start acting even more like tiktok and Instagram Twitter's about to so I really just need you to put all that content on every platform here's the key though you've got to get great at what to do slightly different on every platform to maximize reach I'm sure everyone here can agree that there's a platform of all the platforms that they feel the most confident in yes right that is your biggest vulnerability everybody yeah and it gets worse you know how like when you get older you become like a worse version of yourself in some ways you become like less curious like obviously wisdom and there's some good things but I think everybody understands what I'm about to say like I bet you a lot of you have been on other platforms even back to the Johnson fam saying what about our Facebook that you said like a lot of you've been on other platforms but because you took off on Instagram or tiktok or youtube you're like oh that's where I feel good about myself I need I need you to fucking work on this you know how you don't like who works out here raise your hand you know like some of you like don't want to work out on legs even though you know you're supposed to this shit's about leg workouts cardio workouts like no shit you like doing yoga so you do yoga seven days a week but how about fucking building up your ass muscles or this or that you know like so basically that that's yeah exactly like by the way me too like I can only do cardio if I'm playing basketball because running against myself is fucking boring like everyone's got their shit so listen to me there's seven platforms that matter if you want to get famous you need to win on all of them because you never know which one what how what where what you can't post the same exact thing on every bit you can post the same video but you need to make the thumbnail different the first three seconds different the copy there this is the reason I wrote day trading attention please if you haven't read it or listened to it I don't want your two bucks that I get from my publishing deal you can pirate it on pirate bay I don't give a shit just read it seven platforms platform excellence on all of them will lead to everything all of you want how am I going to do that the answer is figure it out like I know the next question well how easy reinvest some of the money you're making how stop wasting your time on dumb shit and spend more time and getting good at it yourself and doing it yourself there's nothing more important there just to clarify the reason you're changing the text on the thumbnail is it an algorithm thing or is it because the audience is a little different both both yeah I mean I don't think it's gonna be complicated to everybody every one of us does our thing I know most of your things you're gonna think that the LinkedIn audience is different than the TikTok audience why wouldn't you change the thumbnail to like things you can do while you're at work or having a tough day with your boss let me make you smile for an hour you put that on LinkedIn you're not gonna put that on fucking TikTok weirdly what you'll learn is you might put that on TikTok and you never would have thought of it like the game becomes incredible when you're a Swiss army knife instead of just being a fucking fork most of you are just fucking forks right now you're so fucking good at being a fork that all your dreams and hopes have happened but if you're a fucking Swiss army knife I like it and what are the seven platforms that you're talking about Facebook Twitter YouTube YouTube shorts Instagram right Snapchat spotlight LinkedIn here let everybody I'm gonna write it in the chat to you Snapchat spotlight no one's thinking about LinkedIn no one's thinking about right those those are the two curveballs the one that blows my mind is everybody just went away from Facebook because they thought it was like not important when it's like the biggest one of them all you know obviously YouTube's a juggernaut especially for a lot of people here there's obviously YouTube and YouTube shorts then there's the people in here that give a fuck about their Instagram aesthetic and their grid that drive me crazy that I need to get to post on reels only so there's a lot of nuances this is why I need you to read the book there's like a lot to go into if you worry about your grid then you can post reels only and it doesn't show up and you can get to the volume that I'm looking for that I want you to do so there's just a lot to this all right somebody being intentional about creating content for four kids because I think not only would like somebody who loves fashion but loves loves intentionality behind a lot of things sometimes it feels like this world is kind of broad and not for everyone so finding this is really cool to see I can maybe show my kid this as he grows and as he kind of develops those habits and as I'm kind of understanding what who I am and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to find as well as I can be cool to see how I'm gonna think. Thank you brother yeah man the books you know I have a book I think most of you know this but meet me in the middle like I really think that nobody's out here there's not enough that's not there's not enough kids programming under eight that's intent is selfless and then selfish the reason I'm going to win is because I always win like I desperately want to help parents and then of course if everyone's like oh shit this is good like this is helping me like all of us as parents are trying to find the middle now right the far left and the far right parenting thing is not working so everyone's trying to go purple instead of red and blue so if I bring that value especially as parents are figuring it out of course good things will happen for me I don't know how people don't get that like we're all talking about things that we want for ourselves right now but when you make the content make it for them and then this stuff will happen. My question on that the one I asked you this is my last one is really for someone who is really known in that in such a specific space and in marketing and all these like and what you are known for taking a dive into something else like a few friends or content for children my struggle for me personally is being known for one thing creating content out being a part of it bro you see this right above me you know what that is can you see it yeah it's wine it's the only thing people knew me for for seven years of my career I was America's wine guy how do you how do you get through that mental like I'm by not giving a fuck of what people want from me by having the humility to lose views how about that do you know why most of you aren't taking risks because you're so attached to the range of views you normally get don't live for the algorithm live for yourself yep I want you to know how to maximize the algorithm but what you fill it with must fill you oh shit I like that I need to clip that was a good that was that I have never said that before that was a good one that was a good one I like that one yeah it one thing about being a man as a father for Joe when he's all right Joe I got four kids I got three girls but I got a boy he's 15 and I will tell you for me I found the most difficult thing about raising a man is being a man myself so one of the greatest things you can ever get your son it's not just your time because Gary told us his father didn't give his time you know what his father gave him he showed him what a man does you know where Gary's work ever comes from his father 100% where it's time to become a man and by the way until I'm starting to interrupt we're jamming out my father taught me more than any person on earth what not to be and I thank him for that this is about what what my father taught me what my mother taught me what my circumstance taught me what my era taught me was I'm accountable think about this nice moment my poor dad just got fucking dragged through the ringer like rather this nice moment and I decided to jump in to tell you my dad taught me what not to be like we've got to understand that we're trying to parent functional humans you know so there's just no balance there's no right and you all know this I saw the Johnson family like heading out on this when I said my sister is like that means that that connected because you all know this you have siblings what your siblings are the same as you like there's different DNA and that's the fucked up thing with this you think that there's a right way it might work for one kid and it might be the total opposite for the other that's why I put my mom on a pedestal she parented all three of us very differently and it still turned out different it didn't even matter she did it right there's still other variables friends matter life matters like the era you grow up matters I don't think I would be this fat ass if I was growing up right now the world's telling me to be the soft you it feels like such a inventory father you're rediscovering yourself which is interesting as you're creating content I'm like I'm feeling unsure about things so I think it's cool to I think it's about talking real with kids like I'm trying out here but like it's love like the number one thing I believe that we should teach our kids is to be comfortable with being uncomfortable the number one that's that's real like I think we can all agree with it deep down if you melt it at all down that's life I'm leaving you with this all of you because I know all of you somewhat all of you have the capacity to be much bigger in your goals and ambition there's a direct correlation to your ability to be good on all seven platforms you leave with that today shit will change you know this because being good at one platform changes your whole life figure that that's where I want you to put in work all right we'll talk more soon thank you so much
