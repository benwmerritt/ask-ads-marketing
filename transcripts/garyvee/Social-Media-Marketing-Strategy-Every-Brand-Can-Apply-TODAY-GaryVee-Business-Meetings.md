Being remarkable at organic to then amplify with influencers or paid media on what actually works as organic is the entire game. These pieces of content aren't to get you to the three high production ads. These pieces of content are individual ads themselves. Every one of them. This is not throw against the wall and see what sticks. These are fucking every day we're fucking marketing and like we want this video to do well. Even if it's lo-fi, like this is our ad. Not it. Run it. For the day. Don't spend media on it. Go organic. Then see how it goes. Then spend media on it. Attention is the number one asset. I wanted to give you a little just quick context first and then so basically like as you know, eight years ago with the help of you guys, you know, the main vision. Yeah, the main vision of the company was distribution and go e-com direct. I have a very good memory. Go ahead. Absolutely. So we did that with your help accomplished it. 3x the company like fantastic. So now the mission today is so we've analyzed our customer base and it is it's pro and prosumer. Very, you know, that's like 99%. I want to go consumer. This is the vision of the company. Everybody in the company is aware of this vision to go consumer where we are putting things in motion to do that. But I wanted to run this by you and are we on the right track? What am I missing? Can you fill in the blanks? You know, for me in this process because I mean, it's gnarly. It's a whole different ballgame going pro to consumer because there's there's a lot of forgiveness in pro. The consumer. Yeah, it's like it's going from high school football to the national football league. Yeah, exactly. You're going to the big boy world now. That's what I want to do. That's exactly right. And it's I mean, I realize how hard it is. Yeah, the biggest things is humility at the core of every decision. Okay. Like it's going to be harder. Oh my God. I told so I got that check. I honestly have that. I swear to God, I have that. I'm like, this is so difficult. Like I realize how hard it is. Look, I think it's going to be we have to check all the boxes like what's going on with your tech stack for your retail site. What's your allocation for marketing? How do we not waste the dollar on it? What's best? What's the you know, organic social is going to be the most important thing. So, so just on that really quick. So I read the book twice. It was humongous. Obviously, I'm sure you know that for me. It was massive. So we have our cohorts in development right now. And as a matter of fact, James and Andrea were kind enough to have me send them to Rima. I think over at Sasha, she has analyzed them. She came back with amazing feedback. So that's happening. I guess my thing is trick is the vibe concept. Oh, it's insane. Dude, the vibe concept has changed everything. It was the ignition for me to like have these moments of these light bulb moments, Gary of like, oh my God, oh my God. This is what I need to do. Like it honestly, I was telling this to Andrea and James to huge ignition for me massive. But like so we're also going back and just kind of redoing our brand book so that it is more consumer facing because it's always been pro facing. So we're elevating that. We're getting on our cohorts. We're really developing that. We're going to have all different types of content basically ranging from with direct to consumer. Are we going into retail? Are we doing everything DTC DTC to start and then use the leverage of that? Yes. That is exactly because I've had the experience already of distribution where they had all the control and yeah. So I want to build it direct first. And how good do we feel about the product? So product assortment is we're redoing everything. So packaging, everything is getting redone. The consumer section. Let me rephrase this. Rephrase this. The consumer product section of our company is all getting redone the packaging. It's getting a full refresh because it has to how much money in marketing are you going to have for the first year? Um, I mean, our current budget is is about. Dollars a year. So that's for pro consumer. Yeah. Yeah. That's like that's Amazon Instagram Google advertising. How much of that is working media? Uh, what do you mean? How much of that is money that you spend as ads versus the money you spend on people or the creation? That's sorry. That's that's working media. Got it. That's not taking you account salaries or anything else. And not what about the salaries of the people that make the videos and the pictures and all that is what? No, no, no. Yeah, correct. It's not including that. This is this is just on paid media. Um, okay. And but that's all for pro. It's all for pro. Correct. What's your and what's your plan now that you're adding consumer? So I want to basically I want to have 80% of our content over the next few years. I want to transition our content to be 80% consumer and 20% pro right now. It's 100% pro, but I want to transition it in that even in the media too and probably we'll need to up depending. I mean, as we scale, I know the budget has to go up. Um, Okay. And so where are you at right now? Where we haven't started yet? No, uh, in the beginning phases, we're developing brand book cohorts. All that's in development. I'm looking at 2025 probably for like a proper launch. And how many people make organic social now for the pro? Uh, in house, we've got, um, there's we have a team of eight. Awesome. Uh, that right there is the whole game. Those people and what they do and the book, new book and cohorts and like being remarkable at organic to then amplify with influencers or paid media on what actually works as organic is the entire game. Okay. Okay. So, so the way that you with that budget will be able to get it going. By hitting paid dirt organically to hit what? I'm sorry to hit strike oil. Oh, got you. Right. Right. I got you. Okay. Um, on that. So I wanted to kind of run this by you too. So like we're looking at kind of a blend of content ranging from low production, fast turnaround, high volume that we can do in house with the new book. And then basically taking, um, taking our cohorts that we develop, mixing them into the different content pillars and then have different qualities from like low production, fast moving, high volume, all the way to even take crying storytelling, longer, high production pieces. Maybe two, three times a year, but having this blend is that. That's right. But I would only make the high production stuff after you have affirmation from the lo fi. Oh, I see. Got it. Okay. I see. Yeah. Like telling a story of a mother and a daughter in Toronto. I mean, I'm not sure if you're going to be able to tell me about that. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. And I think it's a story of a mother and a daughter in Toronto will then pound social organic, see if there's something there, there and then use the affirmation from the algorithm on the creative testing to make your bigger bets. I see. You see, don't spend money. Don't spend money if you don't have to. Okay. And then totally got it makes perfect sense. On influencers. So right now we work with VaynerSports and we partnered on the Twitch side with a phenomenal influencer. She's amazing. I feel like on our end, we were maybe a little early because we're such, we're pro, pro, pro and she's very consumer-facing. I realize this now. Honestly, after meeting with a lot of people on your team and reading the book, I was like, Oh my God, I was too early. I was too early. Once we have the cohorts developed and we start creating content, matching that up with the right influencer, is that kind of the right way? That's right. Okay. Yeah. Or sometimes using an influencer that's left field just to see if it creates the cohort. It could go in both ways. Right. Right. Right. And then it's like, oh, wow, that's an area that we need to go. We should be crushing. I'll give you one because of my family dynamic, the Persian explosion in Canada is enormous. The amount of people from Iran into Canada is in Toronto. Huge. The Persian community is exploding. Well, that would be like, for instance, be saying that I would say to that like, hey, we should try to do a couple of these Persian young female influencers and see if it could catch pay dirt in that community because we know it's exploding. Got it. And then we're like, let's stand up 20 to 30 year old Persian girls who immigrated from Iran to Canada who use this as a little because they're still immigrants as a little escapism. This is the thing that's for John. Gotcha. Okay. I got it. No, you're making half Persian, half English, half French content. You know, right, right, right, right. No, dude. Wow. Okay. I mean, the good thing, I'm sorry. We're going to say something? No, no, no. I was laughing because I'm like, it is pretty cool. Like the wall is changing. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's insane. I mean, we're like, we brought on this amazing company that I'm working with. And I mean, he's very familiar in the consumer world. I know I needed that. And also he works with the desires specific in the consumer world. And so like for situations like what you're describing, I can come to him. He's a phenomenal network where he can tap in and find exactly what we need to create that type of content. I guess my last question, Gary, is I want to be conscious of your time is creating it to scale. So what I'm understanding is make the based on the cohorts and everything that we, you know, once we have that finalized, which we're getting very close, make the content, turn it around quick, whatever's working, then go the higher production. Yeah. And you can get, you may want to decide how you do that, meaning one video, you might be getting 300 views and then one video gets a million. You're like, this is it. Or you might have 300 views on everything and then one gets 10,000. You make another one around the same genre. It gets 10,000. Another one, it gets 20,000. Like, wait a minute, this over index for us. Got it. Okay. And remember another thing, very important. These pieces of content aren't to get you to the three high production ads. These pieces of content are individual ads themselves. Every one of them is fun. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. We're not throwing through spray and pray. This is not throw against the wall and see what sticks. These are fucking every day. We're fucking marketing. And like we want this video to do well or this, even if it's lo-fi, like this is our ad. Run it. Run it. Yeah. So run it and don't spend media on it. Go organic. Yeah. Then the algo does then spend media on it. I got you. And then maybe if we wanted to go deeper into the higher production. Individual ads organically become the brief to the higher brouh stuff. Okay. Okay. I got it. Dude, completely makes sense. It's so logical. It's insane how logical it is. It's beautiful. Well, it got even more logical when the algorithms, yes, did the creative affirmation. Right. Right. The whole thing you talked about in the book, the tip-talk vacation has, it's beautiful. I mean, it was like, oh my God, that's what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. That's what one's like, what's going on? Yeah. That's what's going on. And it totally clarifies it. And then even if our content is all pro right now, like we can start peppering in the storytelling BC. Yeah. That's the best part. Yeah. Totally. Back in the day, you had to have different accounts all this. Like now it's just like eat it. Right. Right. Like your next organic post should be for the mail, mail, nail polish movement. Post it. Right. Right. Right. See what happens. Perfect. Awesome, man.
