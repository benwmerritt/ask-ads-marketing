What would I do on TikTok? You would do whatever you want. Give Sean a lookie. That would probably get at least 100,000 views. There you go, Mwede. That's at least a million. A million? I bet. A comic. Attention is the number one asset. What would you go as if you had a costume at Comic-Con? If that 30% turned into 70%, what would you dress up as? I'd go Batman for sure. Like I said, the other one that I would play out is the flash is very big for me. Like when I think about comics, I was never really fast. You understand that, right? Right, right. I get it. And so I think the flash would probably be in consideration as well. No doubt. You're very big in the digital world. Yeah. In-person events like that, they're still very important to you? Yeah, I think even hearing as I was about to come on, talking about it's nice to be back in studio, I think COVID did a lot of things, changed the world in a lot of ways. But I think for a lot of people, I think it makes people appreciate being together as well. I think it's great that we now know how to use Zoom and Hangouts. And I'm sure for both of you, it's saved some travel. I used to travel literally every week for my businesses pre-COVID, now not having to because you can have the meetings virtually. But going to things, Comic-Con, coming to the stadium was funny. I was working with my trainers, a big Vikings fan. And we were talking. Like I hadn't brought this up in a while. We talked about the season when they played without fans. And you know what I mean? And it's crazy. And so I think I love people, like even all this incredible crew that you have behind you. If it was less, if it was just us recording with a camera, my energy would be lower. I like people. I like that part. And yeah, so even though I'm all about digital, really I look at digital as a gateway to in-person. Like a lot of people talk about, these kids don't have relationships anymore. They're all so introverted. I'm like, no they're not. They make the relationships on Twitch, on Xbox, on social. And then they meet those people in real life. They have more friends than we did. We had the friends that we grew up with in the neighborhood. And so I don't demonize digital. And I definitely don't demonize in-person. I think the world is both. And I like them both. I like it. All right, now we got to do this. You're a Jets fan. Big time. Big part of your life. I have not missed a snap. I need you to hear this. When you were you born? 81. This is amazing. The 1982 season is my first Jets season. They went to the AFC Championship game, by the way, they tricked me. But I've literally not missed a snap of a New York Jets football game on TV or physically since. No DVR, no Tebow, no unfortunate thing. Thank God in my life of a funeral or a good thing like a wedding. Nothing. Zero. Missed none of them. So I'm not a Jets fan. There is levels to it. Just like you guys were all time players, there's levels to being a player, there's levels to being a fan. I've not missed a snap since basically your whole life. That's impressive. I think Mike Greenberg would be impressed by that. I agree. Mike might be impressed by that. You're above both of them as far as accountability. Yeah, I mean it is disproportionately my biggest passion. I'm an overall big sports fan. There's other things I like. I grew up in the wine business. I like that world. But Jets football can't do it. For sure. Well, it's not easy being green. No, not in this town. And by the way, the way I became a Jets fan was I moved to Edison, New Jersey when I was seven. I went outside. Bunch of kids were throwing the Nerf football. And again, like I said earlier, I just moved to the country. I'm just learning the ways. And they're like, what's your favorite team? I'm like, I have no idea. And if Eric Godfrey, if you're watching Eric, I'm still upset about this. All he had to do was say Giants. And I would have four Super Bowls. But he said Jets and I have no appearances. And so, yes, it is definitely a challenging journey. But you know what's interesting? It worked out for me. I grew up a big Yankees and Rangers fan. But when the Rangers won the Cup in 94 and the Yankees won in 96, it took everything out of it. I'm now disproportionately Jets' Nicks with those two teams. Because they're very one. Celebrated that. Like, hey, done that. Check the box. I want it. It's funny. I know it's not the normal way for a lot of fans. A lot of my friends are like, that's so stupid. What is that? That's crazy. I just can't help the way I feel. Something about this as a fan is about the climb. And then when you reach it, it becomes different for me. And so... It's probably like your businesses. So you kind of grow them. You want to get them early, grow them, grow them, grow them. All right, hey, we accomplished it. Get out. Let's start to know what. It's very common for entrepreneurs to do that. My two core businesses, the wine business in Jersey Wine Library and this main or media business some building, they're like forever family businesses. But to your point, it is very common for entrepreneurs to only like the beginning. That when it hits scale and you have to worry about, yeah, when you have to manage 100 people, like it changes. And so, yeah, that's how my sports fandom has worked. I want the climb. I like the pain. I like the heartbreak at some level. So the Jets have been good to me in some ways. You like the pain. Take the pain soldier. Let's talk about the good. Okay, yes. Your favorite Jets player. Well, so just to context, seven years ago, my brother, who was my partner in the marketing company, decided that he wanted to be an NFL agent. So we rep, sauce and DJ Reed, both corners. So as you can imagine, they're gonna play out a certain way. But I'm a funny fan. Like I'm deep, like Chad Sarat, who's like a special teams linebacker who I love that North Carolina is like a player I literally genuinely like. And I think number 82, Gibson, I think Gibson is the X factor this week. My deep gut feel is that it's gonna be his, he's someone to look out for this week. Cause I think it's gonna be a tough game to your point. I think both the, the Giants defense is making me nervous. The last two weeks, they look really strong. And we're not an offensive juggernaut. But, you know, it tends to be like, you know, players, Tony Adams, the safety I'm obsessed with. He had obviously a monster, most jet fans that are casual got to know who he was last week cause of the pick on hurts. And so there's a lot of guys on the team. And plus I'm so fortunate at this point, I'm such a big fan. We're in the business. I've recruited a lot of these kids at this point. I know a lot of the guys. And so it gets hard when, you know, about seven or eight years ago, it started to cross over into like, I wasn't just watching it on TV. I started to get to know them personally. Even like, like for example, last year, Brax and Barrios was one of my favorite players. And Brax is like the best dude. I love Brax, but I hate Brax now. Cause he's a dolphin and watching him last night. Like I want nothing. Every time he like took a ponder or kickoff last night, I'm like, do not run this back cause I'm mad now. And so, you know, it gets complex. I'm sure for you guys as well, like you guys played the game. You know the guys in the locker room. Like, you know, I'm not sure for either one of you two if when and if it ever crosses over into, you can be a normal fan. There's no normal fan experience for you guys, especially with you doing this for a living. But you know the guys and you have players that you definitely appreciate the way they play cause you understand it deeper. And I think, you know, it all goes into all that, right? Justin Hardy, who won't play this week cause he's hurt, which is a big blow to the judge. Like I love him because I actually am at the point in my fandom where I like really appreciate the gunner. And I understand what it means and I understand like how that could be a factor. Yeah, I'm impressed. In fact, you know what a gunner is. You got Chad. I could learn. I don't know what a gunner. I have no idea what you're talking about. What are you talking about? What is that? That's not a punty. You got a joke. I'm aware you know. I love that. So it sounds almost like you're like kind of want to get into ownership with the judge. Is that? You've done your homework. I haven't talked to Woody Johnson about this. I haven't because I think it's super inappropriate that if you can't afford it, then you're just a poser and like a clown and I have no interest in embarrassing myself or wasting his time. But yeah, I mean, you know, and I'm proud of this. Like in my sixth grade, I don't know why my sixth grade asked everyone to like predict what they were going to do when they grew up. But like literally in the little fake yearbook, cause it wasn't even like a real yearbook, but in our end of the year picture in sixth grade in John Adams middle school and Edison in Jersey, like everyone's like an astronaut or an architect was big in the 80s. I don't know if anybody, everyone was going to be an architect in my was owner of the New York Jets. So somewhere around, so in first, second, third grade, I was like you guys, I dominated in football. I heard. I had great, you heard about it, right? It was huge. We're still talking about these. Yeah, your dad was like sending me messages like I was coming. I have very, very good hand-eye coordination. And so first, second and third grade were remarkable for me. Around fourth grade, that's when speed, strength, athleticism, size, things started to like come into play that did not go in my favor. So somewhere around fifth or sixth grade, I'm like, I'm probably not going to play for the Jets. And so, but at that point, I was already doing the baseball cards thing. I was doing lemonade. I was very entrepreneurial before that was a word. And so I decided that I wanted to own the Jets. And you know, as I sit here today, like even walking in here and like, like I continue to have that dream. I'm aware that it's going to require a lot of things to go incredibly well over the next three decades, but I'm here for it. If you were an owner, you know, it's a couple of decades owner or hey, next year you become owner, what are some things you'd change within the NFL? Within the NFL, you know, I think if I was in committees and like, and we're talking about things, I think the subjectiveness of roughing the passer is a real pain in the ass. You review that, reviewable, you think? I would like that. I think that would make us fans. And like, I think that is probably the most needed reviewable play. I think they should ask the quarterback, you know, and some is like, hey, was that passer? Like, no, no, no, he like barely brushed my leg. They're not dramatic. Yeah, like there's some that are like, yeah, that guy, like, I was asking for an appellate. They're like, he hit my face, but he touched my face. It was like, it was a gentle brush. I'm gonna say they call it, you could like quarter, some quarterbacks, it's like the honor system. Like basketball? Yeah, you should be like, shake it off. Like, no, no, no, that's not what, no. I get it, I get it. You're calling that off. That was the ball. No, but I think, look, I think the fact that we, if we're making pass interference a reviewable play, I think roughing the passer is a heart, right now, and you went through this, I'm sure in your career, and I think in your era, it was obviously different than it is now, but I'm sure you even felt consciously or subconsciously that at some point, you started earning the respect of the league and the refs and just the vibe. And that it would then be more likely that you would get a call than not. I mean, you know, and maybe you see a different, that's actually in question form. I'm curious if you think that. I can tell you, as a Jets fan, we're tired of the NFL finding a player for hitting Zach and not getting a flag. We are now by far the longest-tenured team in the league without a roughing the passer, and I think a lot of it has to do with Zach not earning his, you know, I look at what Jalen got, you know, what Watkins got called for yesterday on Jalen, Zach's not getting that call. And that might be a delusional die-hard fan saying that, but the data supports it, and so I think a reviewable play for that would be big. You know, I think that stands out tremendously to me as one of the things that is a little bit of like an anxiety for fan bases and the league, and I think it would make it a good product. I think the other thing I would do, I really like what's going on with this flag football thing. I don't want our football to become flag football. Listen, you know, and I get that, and look, look, safety, I get it, I'm for it. Like, I miss the kickoffs, I miss that a lot. The returns used to be such a factor. Back them up to the 15-yard line. Yeah, and by the way, I mean, for all the die-hard Jets fans or the people. The kicker kicks it from the 15, but everybody else can start at the 30, you know? Like just get the ball, like they can come up, they're at the 50. I think something. The kickoff thing, have them start up there. Something, I could tell you for the, for the probably small group of die-hard Jets fans that are watching this right now, the Rex Ryan years, if we don't have Brad Smith returning, I mean, the Jets, that Sanchez offense was bleak. Our special teams, I mean, we beat the Steelers in a game that mattered because of a Brad Smith kickoff, the Colts, like these were, they were essential for the Jets back then. And I missed that part of the NFL. So that's another rule that I am curious to look at. But I, you know, the league has done a really good job in a lot of ways. And I think a lot of the rule changes, the crackback blocks that are now being thrown a lot. I think that's good. Like guys, you know what it is, you guys know this. These guys are getting so big and fast. Like when people get into real conversations with me about this, I'm like, guys, do you understand the average guy, what his speed and strength compared to 30, 40 years ago when we were growing up? Like these guys are so big and fast. Like we've had, these are appropriate adjustments. We're trying to make the game safer, no doubt. I want to go back to something real quick. Please. Remember has it that your Jets fandom started because your mom made you a sweater. It's probably the same color as the one you're wearing right now. Yeah, it is actually. Take us back to that sweater. Thank you for bringing that up. I'm gonna try not to cry on the land manning show. So, it was, so the store, I can. Come on, I'm on the top. The story is pretty quickly after the story I told you about Eric Godfrey and Robbie Turnick making me a Jet fan instead of a giant fan. So now they're like, you're a Jet fan. This is right before school starts, late August. The season starts. This is a Jets team that goes to the AFC championship game. It was a strike season, which is interesting. So it was kind of, I didn't get to see our real players for a little while. Nonetheless, everybody in my town has those old raggedy 1980s jerseys. Not the stuff we all wear now, like the half t-shirt. Like your dad, St. Jersey, like that style. Like the t-shirt, it's Jersey. So everybody had a 24 or an 85 for Jets fans. That was Freeman McNeil and Wesley Walker. And I wanted one, because we would play every day. Every day, we'd go to school, we'd come home. And as soon as we got off the bus, the green and white Nerf ball, backyard pickup football, every day, every day. And so I wanted one, but we were like pretty poor in that. We were just starting to get out of like poverty. Like we moved to America. I lived in a studio apartment in Queens with eight family members. Dead poverty, like a hundred bucks to our name. And now we're heading into like a little bit of like lower middle class. My parents were not gonna buy a $25 Jets t-shirt. So my mom at night knitted me a Jets sweater that I would wear with the number five on it. Cause that was my favorite number. That was also Pat Lachey's number. He was our kicker. But it is my prized possession. And it's always been my dream to buy this team. And in a stadium like this, whether it's this one, or that's, cause I anticipate to buy in 20 or 30 years, if I have to build a new one, to put the sweater in the front when people walk in. And I wanted to say, you know, you can literally do anything that, you know, from not being able to buy a Jersey to owning the whole darn team. I have that ambition. And it's, my mom is my hero. My mom is my foundation. My dad's unbelievable. But like I was an eighties kid. My mom was home. My dad worked all the time. And the level of self-esteem she built without delusion. And she's my hero. And that Jersey is the most important physical thing I have. All right. Obviously, Jets Giants this weekend. I'm feeling a friendly wager or non-friendly. Either way. Non-friendly. Non-friendly. You remember on the Giants side, by the way, I'm confused when Giants fans don't like the Jets. You've won four Super Holes, we've won nothing. You're clearly the more popular team in the air. Like what's the problem? Jets fans, it makes sense. I don't think there's a lot of beef. I mean, you only play every four years. It's a little bitter. Yeah. Who runs the, yeah. To pseudo, please. You gotta like, people ask you about it. So you gotta, you gotta say, though this one timed out to be a monster game for both teams. No, yeah. Like the team that loses this week is not going to feel great about their season. So what about something where maybe if Giants win, you wear a Giants jersey? No shot. Or not happy. Not happy anywhere. I would have heard Jets. I've never worn a, I came on Tibido because he's number five. I would wear a Oregon Tibido because it's a five, but like not, not a, Ole Miss, Ole Miss I would wear. Okay. What is your college? Mount Ida College. There is no Jersey. See if there's no Jersey. That sounds like a good bit for you. Yeah. You'd have to drink a 40 and play CeeLo. You know, like if you want to do my college spades, like if you want to do my college. Media hit, you gotta say great win by the Giants this weekend. I can't do that. I can't do that. Like what about, what about wine? I know you like wine. I could put up a great case of wine from Wine Library. That I could do. All right. And for me, maybe some of these Panini cards. I like cards. You like Panini. All right. I'll give you some. Panini. Sounds a little bit off. Indy card. Yeah. And some wine. There we go. Deal. That's a bet. It's a bet. So I'll get in here. All right, Gary. We know you're a big social media influencer. Eli is kind of new to the social media aspect until he was retired to open up the social media accounts, which I think was wise. He didn't want to blow up. He could hear the feelings in the stadium. He didn't need to see it on the internet. You hear the booze in line. That's the only way to come out your phone. Just give Eli some tips. Since he's new to this, what can he do to grow his influence following? I think the thing that a lot of us loved to learn about Eli, especially post-career, but you can even see it when he was playing, is the sense of humor thing is there. And so for me, TikTok is something that is a real worthwhile venture for you. I think so. Like dance moves? No, not the dance. That's what everybody thought like six, seven years ago. TikTok is now the predominant social network. And it is very conducive to humor. What would I do on TikTok? You would do whatever you want, right? And so like literally even like a- If you have Sean and Nuggy. That would probably get at least 100,000 views. There you go, Tim, a wedgie? That's at least a million. A million? I think a comic. That's around over the head. That's Tim, though. But I really think TikTok's one place to look. I think the other place, one thing I've also observed from afar, we haven't really chopped it up, but your business ambitions are real. And so LinkedIn has actually become a monster social network. And I think people still think of it as like a recruiting tool, but using LinkedIn as a social network to talk about your business observations, the things you're thinking about, the kind of businesses you're interested in, business advice that you've learned, things you've learned about, entrepreneurship that's similar to the athletic realm. I think LinkedIn would be another place to really think about it. I think those two stand out. If as a third, I do think, and I continue to believe this, we talked about it earlier about the gunner, or like things that, when you guys watch football, you see different things than the casual fan. I still believe on Twitter, breaking down something that people don't see, and you guys do this anyway, but on social, breaking down something that people don't understand, I think is very, very valuable. Because what we see, and you guys know this, I've always been fascinated by the film room the next day, because I've seen players through the years. I understand football enough to know that there's certain people in the secondary who don't want to take the blame for a mistake, and will literally react to get the crowd to think it wasn't their fault. And I'm like, but that guy has to go in, yeah. And they're pointing and they're like, no, no, that was your assignment, right? The guy, the defensive guy comes over and he goes, that was my fault. I messed up that coverage. I can't believe I've done that. It's not you. And everybody thinks that he's yelling at the other guy. And so I think jumping in Twitter, social commentating of like, what happened there was, two guys ran the wrong route. That's what happened last night. The reason Sleigh got that pick was, two guys ended up in the same place. Clearly something went wrong. Those kind of observations in real time on social are wildly valuable. So basically what I'm gathering is, on TikTok, Eli should break down the butt fumble. Yes, I think you should break down the butt fumble. Actually, you know what's so funny? Sean, the butt fumble doesn't hurt me. I'm just trying to get out of here without talking about Victor Cruz's touch down against the Jets to this day. And Eric Smith, if you're watching, I loved you number 33 for the Jets. Great player, nice hit hard, almost ended Anquan Bolin's career here. But that play, like literally I will go into this Sunday, thinking about that praying to God. Blaming Eric Smith or you blame it? I'm blaming Eric Smith. It's a great throw. I know, I know, I know, I know. It's like a dive. It's like a dive. Yeah, great throw. Great throw. A great throw. Blown up Victor. Yes, I understand, but I still have a lot of feelings. I understand. That started this also. That was like crazy right there. What really is crazy, you know what's crazy about Victor's career? I was here for that preseason game. I was like, who's this guy? You Matt. I think he was four. People always just like the same thing. No, no, no. That was, yep, yep. But it, you know, and I remember, and we were just coming off of Corbett coming out of left field, you know, four or five years, seven years earlier. At a Hofstra. And I was like, man, I hope this Cruz character isn't a real player. He ended up being a very real player. I'm just curious, were you here when Eli bled during the Jets preseason game? I sure did. I could be blue. I remember. I was scary. I've been here for every, I was here for October 94 or three. I was here for the Brandon Marshall in the corner. Like that was the big one for us. But we didn't make the playoffs in 15. But the game we won here, it was, I mean, that's why I'm excited for this Sunday. It's gonna be the second time I'm in this stadium as a road visitor. And so we'll do it again. All right, Gary, we got our Panini cards here. Pack breaking? Let's pack break. Box breaks? What do we call them? What do we call them? When they're in a box, it's a box, but these are packed, packed. Hold on, Eli, what about this? Yeah, look at that. Let's talk about your signature. That's pretty good, don't you think? I'm pretty impressed. This feels like this was the first one in this sitting. No. Cause you know, you're a quarterback, so your hand probably doesn't get tough. Yeah, you never. It's hard to screw up like Eli. You can't shorten that that much. Actually, it's like a big pet peeve of mine. Autographs, like we have some ball, you get like a ball of a bunch of people signing, you're looking through it, you're like, I don't know. Who that is? I can't tell you one autograph of this whole ball. It's like a symbol of, I'm like, so I take a lot of time. I sign a autograph. That was a very nice guy thing to say. Very observant of you, because like, once you get to like the hundredth autograph, sometimes it's not so quick. Oh, a hundred percent. I like that it says retro. That just kind of lets you know. Means you're old. Yeah, right. Got you. All right, what are we thinking about here? Who we got here? Chase Brown. We keep going. Is he a gunner? Ooh, Spears. I'm a gunner. Tadze Spears. Yeah, he's got some breasts. Rookie Kark, he's got some breasts. He's got some breasts. He's got some breasts. Look at that little, oh, I got a big one here, three out of five. Okay, this is very exciting. Because Des Ritter is rep by VaynerSports. We signed him out of Cincinnati. He had a really challenging play this weekend, fumbled out the goal line. I don't know if you saw it, but he played pretty well. So that's three out of five. Three out of five and auto. It was in his autograph. Oh, you guys, wait a minute. Did you guys load this pack? No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, you guys loaded this pack. Guys, who is that? I got all excited about the Des. I thought it was actually natural. Is that a rookie of the year? I look very good in this photo. Is that a rookie? What year is that? I'm very old in this photo. Nothing on the back. It's just a play. No stats. Thank you guys. What's the hand? What do you think that's worth? Five. Oh, there you go. So this is probably worth at least six to seven million dollars, you know. That's what I'm thinking. Oh, what a one. You could buy the Jets. That five. I don't like my home. Okay, so you guys loaded this pack. I appreciate it. You're very sweet. You just scanned over my homes? Yeah, man. I want to see what you naturally got. All right, Jake, the rookie and the Saints. You know. Okay, you got the card. Ooh, this is a nice little card. What do you need here with the? Look at this. Mark is out. Whoa, wait, it's like went back. Legend. Legend. So you can go, it can get throwback. It's a really cool card. See, this is called night lights. And this is, I mean, It's a pretty card. It's a very, Panini day, nice job. They do nice work. Will Leviss, right? Oh, okay. There you go. You never know. That's what you hold in your mouth. See what happens. That's what a quarterback's arms should look like right there. You see that bicep? Actually, this was like a big part of his draft. Do you remember? The sleeves were just long. They covered him up. This gets playing well, by the way. What is that? The spoon. Yeah, spoon. The spoon's playing well. I think he actually had a little interest against the Giants here. Did you put that up on purpose? No, I did not. But I hope we get one. All right, what do we got here? All right, here we go. Cam, he's a nice little player. Here we go. We got a little drink here. He had a nice kid. By the way, there's the auto. Look at this auto. He's like, RR. RR, what is that? He's more strategic than you. He's trying to get his work done quickly. And he signed it in silver. You can even see it. I think that's Richie Rich. Right? He's a nice little player. Take your time, sign the autograph. Ooh, here we go. Let's see if I can analyze that. Sharon Hill, Hall, excuse me. Backup quarterback. I want you to. I think you see another one with the autograph and like cover the name. I want to see if you can read it. Deuce? Deuce Vaughn, here we go. For the Cowboys, yeah. That was absolutely cool. What happened in that Cowboys game here? What happened? The first game of the year. What happened to Giant's here? No, okay, we'll just skip it. We don't talk about Bruno. And Dree, nice little player. Five again. Dree, he's a nice player. Does he want to see one of your clients? No. If there was a back, everyone look at the stats here. Yes. All right, so it's gonna kind of look to, so maybe your birthday, November 14th, 75. 1975, correct. Born Soviet Union. Belarus. You don't see that very often. That's not from the back of the video. Definitely not in the NFL. Maybe a couple of offensive linemen. Obviously, everybody lies about their heights. Yes. It might say five nine on there. But it's really funny. Don't show anyone, please. Favorite team jets. Yes. Favorite drink, wine. Yes. Skills. What's your skill? Social media, talking. I think my skills, my true greatest skill, is taking on stress and converting it to not be stressed for the people underneath me. What about your big, Do you think that's a big thing in your guys game, right? That's a good leadership quality, absolutely. I really think that that is the most obvious variable to me in leadership. Someone who doesn't magnify the stress on everyone, but is able to be the diffuser underneath their team. Sounds like a quarterback, right? It's a lot of quarterbacks. When you lose, hey, you take the blame, I got the shoulders, put it on me, you win, then you disperse all the credit to the receivers, all line, offensive line, you let, you know, you kind of take it on. Eli, let me ask you, go back. It could be a lineman, because we're taking all the stress on, I'm trying to make their job easy. Yeah, you're doing all the hard work and they get all the glory. Exactly. Yeah. I actually always wanted to ask you this. You're overall demeanor, very cerebral. Like, did you develop that, or was that your natural personality, or did you develop that? I think that's my natural personality. I always pretty quiet, kind of watching the room, analyzing, you know, don't say anything unless something truly needs to be said. You know, just kind of let, you know, show up, work hard, do all those things, really let your action speak more than your words. But would you, yeah, I think so, just with you. When something needs to be said, you say it and people listen to it. They're like, hey, he's saying something here. He hasn't said much already. He hasn't said much, like, we got it. Is that how the locker room received it? Yeah, yeah, we had enough guys on defense that were talking, they were talking nonstop. It's like, all right already. But yeah, I think it means a lot more when it's, you know, it's coming from your peers, and when it's, you know, hey look, not somebody that raises their voice, like he never really yelled at guys. Yeah. So, but if he got, like, fired up, like you knew, this is important. I went on a big pregame. I never felt that a pregame speech has ever won a game before. You know, like, that's like the defense, hey, get everybody riled up. Like, I'm not gonna get guys riled up. I'm trying to stay calm. I can't like get you fired up when I'm trying to stay calm. So, you know, leave that spray hand, let them stomp it out. Yeah, I, you know, I've been running businesses my whole life and was the oldest brother in my family and just in general, really pride my, I'm very loud and I'm over the top and I'm an extrovert. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I see it. But I was very, very proud that like, when bad stuff's happening, I always wanted to be the person that stopped it and reformulated it for everyone below me. And I think that service is me well as a CEO, as a parent. And I think that's a real thing that people can work on. It's working, no doubt. Thank you for that. Thank you guys. Working in the February success. Thank you. Excited for the game this weekend. I'm excited, you guys. Thank you so much for coming on. Such a pleasure. Congrats on everything. Of course, guys. Gary, I know you're a big garage sale guy. Like here's our garage sale. You walk up like, what's the first thing that pops up in your eye that? The Leonard Gloves. Leonard Gloves. I'm a big boxing guy, you know, cause you know, I love UFC now, but I grew up in that 80s, 70s, 90s boxing. And I don't think people understand how much of a beast Sugar Ray was. Cause he was such a pretty boy. I don't think people, and they think he was smooth, but he was nasty. And some of his wins in his career, especially the Hernes win, I think are special. So that caught my eye. Quite a bit. I saw that, the Havill Jack. Sandy Kofax. And how? And Pistol Pete, who was like, Rookies, both rookie cars. I know, these are gorgeous. Gorgeous. Look at that. People, Kofax was great, but honestly, besides the gloves, the Boston Garden original bench. Like, yeah, yeah, this is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. You wore that? I didn't wear this. No. You're rocking some jeans. So he had these drawers right there. My version of the homemade sweater, like your homemade sweater. So it looks like I've never worn a pair of Jordans in my life, because I'm such a Knicks fan, and I hate Michael Jordan so much that I've never, ever worn a pair of Jordans in my life. I'm wearing Air Force Ones or Dunks, but no Jordans. I don't think any real Knicks fan over the age of 40 should ever wear a pair of Jordans. If you're 25, you weren't affected by it. You're not mad at it. It's cool. Good Cedar series. Those were heated. Heated. Heated. Sauce. And Quinnen. Look at those. What are you like? No, no, no. This is the key to Sunday. This is the key. Did you bring your own stuff to the garage? Oh, there's a giant in there. Saquan. And this is Quinnen. Tackle Saquan. Yes. That's what I want for Sunday. Yes. This little van. What is that, Eli? Is that what you take in the summer? You guys go over and trade. Family trip. Family trip. This is Shaggy. I love it. The Wheaties boxes were huge in the 80s and 90s. Yeah. I'm all about it. Yeah. Breakfast of champions. There's food in there, Shawn. You can still eat the Wheaties. They're probably good. Yeah, I don't think there's a shame. Are you a Sauggy? How do you eat cereal? Sauggy or just like crisp? I like it crisp. I haven't had cereal in a while, but I like it soggy. I don't like it soggy. Yeah, I like it soggy. I'm super soggy. I'm super soggy. So you pour the milk and then you sit for a while. Either grape nuts or Captain Crunch. Two very extreme cereals, but both do so well with soggy. I like need it. It's almost like not even cereal. It's like a kasha. I need to be like, that's how I eat it. Grape nuts you can eat. You can break it. Grape nuts right away, it's like eating rocks. Rocks. Rocks. You gotta let that soak a little bit. Rocks. A little bit of a little honey. Yeah. Gary, if this were a real garage sale, what would be the most valuable thing on the table? You think? Definitely not. The Kofaks rookie or, but the garden seats really, you know, can have a huge variable. Those would be the two that I would negotiate down. That bobblehead doll. Is that working? Oh, this one, yeah, I saw this on eBay the other day. I think it was like 80 cents. 80 cents. You know, with free shipping. Yeah. That's what, I own 100,000. Now you're talking about that. Now I got real money. Yeah. That's not enough to you. No, this is real. Real. Physical. There you go.
