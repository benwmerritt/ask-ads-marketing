## Transcript
Do you guys even see commercials? Who watches regular TV? I'm giving a talk right now. I've got all your attention, but if I was talking nothing interesting and nothing good and you were bored, then the ad didn't do well. This is what I tell my big clients. I can get you in front of people with paid advertising. They're like, we wanna spend $10 million on this. I'm like, this video sucks. I can get $10 million worth of people to see it, but nobody's gonna buy shit because this video is a fucking commercial. You have to become remarkable at organic because it's free and it will grow your business anyway. But when you hit pay dirt and you've got something that's remarkable and you're into advertising, well, that's what you put your money against it, which means you're saving a lot of money on the thing that was always the hardest thing about advertising, which was the creative, was the variable of the risk. Attention is the number one asset. You're not at this event if you don't have a level of ambition and hunger or want for something to happen. This is a business conference, right? And so I think the thing that most excites me is what was just said prior to here, and then watching him execute this community over the last five years from afar, what I've always known is I don't think what I talk about is so profound. I don't think it's that complex. I actually equate how I see business and brand and marketing and sales and career growth similar to the health and fitness space. I don't think anyone here is confused. The way you get healthier and more muscle is not so complicated. There's a protein situation, there's a carb situation, there's working out, there's eating and working out properly. It is a very simple system, but if you're like me, it's incredibly hard for you to do it. I've been working out for the last 10 years of my life, and when I tell you, I hate it every fucking day, I hate it. On the flip side, many of you in this room love, how many people here love to wake up or in the evening, like genuinely enjoy working out, they get a lot of love for it, they can't wait to do it. Raise your hands, raise them high. All right, a lot. Now, who's more like me and fucking hates this shit? 50, 50. That's what I think is happening here. I can sit here and tell you exactly what to do to grow your business. The only thing that business relies on is attention. Before you can sell someone something, you have to have their attention to sell to them. Attention changed in our society over the last decade, and it made it easier for small entrepreneurs and individuals like us to compete with the biggest companies in the world. You no longer need $30 million in marketing budget to build a $100 million company. There are many companies in different sectors that have built 5, 10, 30, 50, $100 million companies on the back of 100% free, organic social media. That exists. Now, less in mortgage and real estate, more, you know, t-shirts, sodas, things that nature, but no one here is confused. There are plenty of people who've built their entire business on the back of free, organic social media. Many. No one's confused. When I wrote my first book in 2009, people made fun of me for this philosophy. Some of us were there in those events. I remember when I was there, when you were at those bookstores, when I had 30 people showing up in 2009, people thought it was crazy. If you go read the Amazon reviews of my first book, Crush It, in 2009, literally one of the comments is like, they gave you a one star. This snake oil salesman is trying to tell you that people are gonna make $100,000 a year on YouTube. What a fucking joke. Now I personally know thousands of 14 year olds who make $100,000 a month on YouTube. The big, you know, I gave a lot of thought to like, okay, like this crew here talks about personal brand building and content. Like, what am I gonna be able to do that actually brings value? What I'm trying to really do today is really a macro and micro execution. On the macro, I'm just asking all of you, like, do you truly, like what I'm trying to shake someone who's half in? Like, I don't care that it hasn't worked yet. Like that's my favorite one, Gary, you know, at the airport, I always get rolled up on. Gary, I love you, you're a nice guy, but this fucking shit doesn't work. I'm like, cause you suck at it. How many people here are really pot committed and getting substantial success from organic social media for their business? Raise your hands, cool. Now who's not, raise your hands. Yeah, by the way, 90% of the hands that didn't get raised in the first part did not raise their hands in the second part. And I think about that stuff, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. To me, the entire part of that second group is yet. And the only thing that's required is you understanding that the first group that raised their hands are just better at it than you are. Not lucky. Not, this is my favorite one that you fuckers love. They're in a different market. All right. You love that fucking excuse. Gary, you don't get it, I'm in the outskirts of Detroit. No, I fucking get it. There are human beings that consume social media in the outskirts of Detroit. So for me, it's like, okay, if I can get half this group to just get done with excuses, they came here, this was my opening line. You came here, you're here. So it means you want. So if you want, why not do the thing, even if you don't like the thing? I want to live longer. That's why I wake up and work out. I hate it the most. You want more money for your business. Thus, you have to take organic social media extremely seriously. The end. I don't care what your politics are. If you're mad at China, let that shit play out in the macro. It doesn't fucking really actually affect you until it does. And if it does, you're dead anyway, so who gives a fuck? So don't tell me you're not on it because you're mad at China. No politics allowed for why you're being fucking lazy. Yeah, clap that up, Johnny. This is a room full of winners, of which many of you have excuses to why you're not doing this. Just like I have excuses in parts of my life, even though I'm a winner. This is excuses. So let me make this very clear to all of you. For fucking free or a little bit of money, hiring someone in the scheme of a business, the opportunity to make videos, and this is the next most important part that's gonna unlock some of you. It's not just video. Videos, pictures, written words, or audio clippings. The opportunity to do those four things, to build your business at an extremely low cost by posting them on the seven platforms that matter, and we'll get into that in a minute, but obviously you know Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube and YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, especially if you're a B2B in here and do commercial, Snap, Snapchat Spotlight does exactly what Instagram and TikTok does, but nobody pays attention to it, so it's easier to get attention there. And Twitter. If you don't understand that those seven free platforms, you know how many people come up to me in a business context like Gary, but fuck Facebook zucks, fuck zucks. Like the algorithm's screwing me. This is bullshit, I'm shadow banned, they're screwing me. I'm like, this is the worst, I'm like, it's free. My friends, social media marketing, if you do it organically, is free. There's, you don't get a billboard put up on the highway in your town for free. You don't get a full page ad in the newspaper for free. Google doesn't give you those search results of you showing up first for free, it's free. And something changed my friends in the last three years that was not the social media that I built on. The social media I built on was more like email marketing. You would post a lot to get as many followers as you can and a percentage of them would see your content every time. So I, when I outflanked most in 2009, 10, 11, 12, so when I was giving this talk in 2016, many in the room felt defeated, because like fuck Gary, you've got seven million followers, I've got none, and I could understand why people in the room would be like shit, two years before any payoff, that's a level of patience that most people don't have in their stomach in this room. But that world doesn't exist anymore. I hope everybody's been paying attention to what's happened in the last 24 to 36 months. If you've been sitting here completely punting social for 15 years, good news, unlike most things in life, you don't have to pay the piper, because what happened with the tick-tockification of social media in the last three years is now every social network doesn't go based on how many followers you have, it goes on the merit of the creative itself. There are people in this room, I have 15 million followers on TikTok. There's somebody in this room that's gonna get motivated today, create a TikTok, make their first video tomorrow, and that video will get more views than the post that I will post that same day. That's fucked up and I'm pissed. But I can't be pissed, because that's how the game is now. If that doesn't motivate you in this room, I have no idea what they do well. The part that's most interesting to me is that I'm aware that a lot of you are self lack the self esteem and have too much insecurity of going on video. And I'm empathetic to that. You're stuck in seventh grade, like most adults. You are literally not building your business because you can't handle someone going to your social media post named Johnny Pants 13 and saying that you're ugly or stupid. I'm just gonna say that one again, because this is really scary. I believe over 30% of this room is not all in because they are literally stuck in high school because they fear or are too affected by a stranger coming on their social network page on a post and making fun of their appearance, their weight, or the words that came out of their mouth. Their age, their look, their politics, I get it. I don't want that for you. Especially when you shouldn't feel bad for you when that happens, you should feel bad for the person that's leaving that comment. Could you imagine how shitty of a life it is to go around the internet and try to hurt other people's feelings? I would like to show you the visualization of what's going on in that person's heart. It's sad, I feel bad. The only people that do that on earth are ones that are hurting. So please get your self-esteem up. Let me tell you what I also see with this crew. Some of you are actually big players in your market. You've got kids that are much smaller. You're a much bigger mortgage, much bigger real estate, but you've got youngsters or new people, they don't even have to be youngsters, who have more followers, even though their book of business is much smaller than you. And you don't like the way it looks of you only having 113 followers, but they have 8,000. So you keep staying off while they keep growing market share. My friends, there's a lot of reasons why you don't do it. None of them are valid. This is the greatest opportunity in the history of small business. All of you are small business. I am small business. We can compete with the biggest brands in the world with no cost by just becoming remarkable at the craft at being great at social media. I spend, I have a team that does, my content, the first 11 years of my career, I did all my content myself. Today, I have a team that team costs me between four and $5 million a year. Just for my social media content team, non ads, just the creative. That isn't to discourage you, because guess what? Plenty of times I look at the team like, fuck it, I could do this all by myself better. It's the reason I'm articulating it to you is I need you to understand how serious this is. I'm not doing that for my health. That wasn't fun. That's not me bragging. It is me operating where I know the business opportunity is. This is the most significant channel to grow your business in branding. This room is in sales. Sales and branding are different. I need people to understand this. Knocking on doors, cold calling, sales. Good, I'm a fan. I mean, I love selling, but selling is what you do when you don't know how to do brand. I'm glad that one hit. Selling is what you do when you don't know how to build brand. And what I mean by that is really at the end of the day you're gonna do both. Selling and branding are both great. But Nike doesn't do door to door sales. Lexus doesn't do door to door sales. Coca-Cola doesn't do door to door sales. And by the way, the characters in your world that get on Netflix and have shows, the business comes to them because that's branding. Branding. And what I want everyone here to do is actually be self aware that they are wasting an enormous amount of time every single day, all of you. Me included. All of us in this room spend an enormous amount of time on dumb shit every day that can be allocated to making content to grow your business. That is my favorite one of all. The people who've been sitting for the first 10 minutes of this and saying, I don't have time to make the content. You sure do. Because that two hour lunch you take every day, it's straight bullshit. Right? And so what I am passionate about and what I'm trying to articulate here and what I'm pushing hard on is do you understand how big of an opportunity this is? And I feel like if you did, literally nothing would stop you. That's a health and wellness. I luckily got ahead of it 10 years ago and I was like, you know what? I just know this is not gonna work out. Just like I know the people that aren't working hard on their businesses always go out of business. But normally a guy like me or the hands that just went up that it doesn't come easy to, the time they get serious is when they have, you know, a heart attack and luckily survive or they go to the doctor and they tell them that they're gonna die in two years or they're diabetic or whatever. I think it's scared to address it. What I'm concerned about in this room, very frankly, is right now I'm asking you to do it out of offense and I believe over the next decade that I'm gonna ask you to do it out of defense. This is a very important part. How many people in this room are retiring within the next seven years? Hold on, and I don't mean you're gonna fucking crush it and buy a jet. I mean, you're fucking old and you're finished. Next seven years, raise your hand, who's wrapping up? Raise it? Two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine. Great, so for the 14 of you, you might, you know, with you two, like, you might be able to hold off this wave that's coming and just see it through. But for the rest of you that didn't raise your hand, for instance, Zillow is going to create is going to create 50,000 virtual influencers who are gonna be their real estate agents. How many people here are familiar with AI virtual influencers? Raise your hands. So this is disproportionately one of the biggest vulnerabilities for this room. In the next year or two, three, everybody in this room will raise their hand when I ask the question, do you know what a virtual AI influencer is? Some of you have already seen them. Usually right now, they're very attractive women on Instagram that if you look carefully, you're like, oh shit, that's not a real person. In the next two to three, four years, it's just gonna be everybody and you will not be able to tell the difference if the person in the video is an AI influencer or a real person. And of course they will do bikinis and all that stuff and only fans, but they will do everything. They will sell sneakers, they will sell wine, they will sell books, and they will sell real estate. And they will sell mortgages, and they will sell everything. My friends, I believe what technology is doing is eliminating everybody except the people that can build brand. I really mean this. And I beg you to take this conversation serious at the bare minimum, at the bare minimum. If you do not have brand building content on social for you, do it for your business. If you're such an introvert and it's a small office, create a fake character, create a mascot. The Geico Lizard does the work for Geico, not Johnny Geico. You've got to figure it out. And on a personal level, I just skipped over it, I wanna come back, it's not just video. If you're a great writer, write. Writing content does well, especially right now. What my latest book that came out a couple weeks ago is called Day Trading Attention. That's what I do for a living, I day trade. Today, on the flight here from LA to Vegas, my team sent me that, my post from two days ago, did incredibly well on Instagram, and our running thesis right now is cause the copy was extremely long. Audio, some of you have great gift of gab, but you genuinely are insecure on video. You cripple, it's okay, you're allowed. I don't wanna take roller coasters, I get it. We have different things that we like and don't like. But if you're a great talker, but you're very weird, I'm video and you don't like it, then take out your phone, hit record and talk, and then post the audio clip on all these platforms. What I'm basically saying right now, and a lot of you know each other, there's a lot of pairs in two, three feet. If I could ask for anything, can we just be accountable? Can we just be accountable to understand how substantial this is? I don't wanna hear that you didn't grow up with it. I'm tired of 54 year olds like, Gary, I didn't grow up with it. I'm like, no shit, you didn't grow up driving and you figured it out. You didn't grow up being a parent, and then you had a kid and you became a fucking parent. I don't care that you didn't grow up with it. And AI is coming and you know it's coming. Like, what you, a lot of you with AI and TikTok have become your parents. It's sad. Tell them again. I'm gonna tell them again. Remember when you made fun of mom and dad for not wanting to do email or get a smartphone? Your dad was good with his fucking flip. Hey, man, you had the iPhone, you're like, dad, or they didn't wanna do AOL instant messenger and you shit on your parents and your teens and twenties? Now you're your fucking parents. If you say no to AI, and if you say no to TikTok, and if you say no to all this shit, you're your fucking mom. Doe is right. And by the way, in real life, this is important. In real life, you do you. In real life. Meaning in your personal life, how you want a parent, how you want to roll, how you want to do, you do you. You can have a beeper, I don't care. But you came to a conference to grow your business and you're willing to deploy your business strategy based on your subjective opinions about shit you don't know. Let me say that one more time. You came to a business conference to grow your business and you're executing currently on social media on a subjective opinion that you have on some shit you don't know. That is the essence of my talk. That how many people here have been following me for more than 10 years? Raise your hand, raise it high. My friends, you guys know I've been on, this is right, you've been with me on this. One more time, I wanna see how many, I just wanna get a sense. A lot of you, which I want you to explain to everyone else here, you've been with me on this for a long time. I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, I don't know if you can see the goosebumps on my arm because I'm feeling it that much. We're kind of in the fourth quarter of this going from the nice to have that can explode you to the, if you do not do this, your business is gonna go out of business. And out of business is extreme because you're still gonna have your relationships and your reputation, but dent it as fuck, is not fun either. You are going to get outflanked, it's happening. There is, like, how many people here get business from Google AdWords, raise your hands, raise them high. Very few, shit, a lot of you should be doing that. I thought most of you were gonna do that. So by the way, real quick for the next 24 to 36 months, a lot of you need to figure out how to fucking do Google AdWords locally. But my point was gonna be, what the hell happens to Google AdWords advertising when everybody uses chat GPT to do search? Shit changes. People used to dominate something called the yellow pages. Who's under 30, raise your hands, under 30? Kids, let me tell you a crazy ass fucking story. You're gonna love this shit. You know how sometimes you drive and you see, like, a van go by and it says triple A cleaners or like triple A fucking insect repellents or triple A stuff like this? Do you know why all those companies were called triple A? Because the yellow pages dominated how people did things and when you would go to the services, they would do it by alphabetical order. So whatever fucker got the triple A first, showed up first and got most of the business. Stuff always changes. We're in a really deep place with this social media thing where it's becoming the oxygen. The business and it's free. It's free. It's the only thing it requires is for you to actually get great at it, which takes a lot of time, which is not free. And then once you understand how important it is, you're gonna hire people to help you make content. But a lot of you have already done that and have gotten video people and things of that nature, but here comes the AI and it's gonna lower the cost of these people. Poor Dustin sitting there so beautifully filming me right now. AI's gonna fucking fire him. You're dead, Dustin. You're fucking dead. I'll find you a better job because I love you, but good news for the people that haven't started paying for creative, you're gonna be able to use things like mid-journey and all these other advancements that are gonna be built. Every social network, in fact, by default for free, will have AI capabilities in it before you post and you'll just have to do the raw video, upload it, and you can post, produce that shit like you're Stephen fucking Spielberg. My friends, you're lally gagging. If you are not posting three to four original pieces of video, written word, audio, pictures, a day, a day, then you are leaving money on the table. You're allowed to do whatever you want. You're not my sister, I don't give a shit, but I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, if you're not doing it, somebody else is gonna do it. And at this point in 2024, I know a lot of you have started to see that truth. A lot of you know there's a bunch of people selling houses in your markets that don't know shit about real estate because they're two years in, but they do know social media, yes? So what the fuck? We gonna let these punk motherfucking kids get all this shit? And by the way, I knew that would get a clap. Now let me give you something that's gonna be quieter. They deserve it because they're out flanking you. You're the punk. Oh, we got real quiet there. You're the punk. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I know. Stand up, give it some room. Give it some room. Give it some room. Give it some room. Give it some room. Give it some room. Thank you. Thank you. So. I didn't tell you what I wanted to do. But that was exactly what I wanted to do. Why? Because I'm frustrated that so many people, I talk to some of the people that's in this event and it's just this fraction of people who are consistent on social, but everybody else agrees with me. They're not arguing with me. They're not saying no, Neil, you're a liar. Well, that's, it's similar to the framework. Nobody's gonna be like, no, doctor, you're an idiot. I should continue to gain weight and drink alcohol. And like, nobody's gonna say that. I'm being very empathetic to this. I got very lucky that health and wellness come so hard to me and I didn't do it for the first 40 years of my life and then I've done it for the last 10. Like, I really mean this. It's really hard for me. Like, I, you know, like, meaning, like every morning I wake up, I'm like, I don't wanna do this. But, you know, it gets easier, right? Like anything and like, I know a lot of you are like, Gary, I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna post a video and get two views. I don't wanna spend an hour to post a video, get three views and I get no business from it. And I'm like, I get it. But what happens when you do that for a year and one of those videos gets you seven clients? Yeah. Right? And my other point is you're wasting other time on dumb shit. So give me that hour. Give me your worst fucking hour every day. Give it to me to give it back to you to make fucking content for social media. Yeah, that's it. That's the strategy. And I think what Gary says, three or four, is to constantly be like, oh my God, I can barely do one. Well, one a week. These fuckers are doing one a week. Yeah. There's a video that just went viral on Gary and the lady says she wants to change the world. And he says, how much are you posting? I don't know, I think the comment are you posting and she said once a week. She said once a month. Once a month. I said, motherfucker, you're trying to change the world? You guys are just trying to sell some more shit, a couple of houses, some more. Like, you know, like. But it's crazy because the one video was like, I need to get a story with them on stage or walking over here, a quick thing. Some of it's like a video that you sat down and produced but other things are like a quick thought and I tweeted out. It's not that complicated when you think about it. So one of the things I just want to get real with Gary is I got questions that you all submitted and I put these into what I think it would benefit the most. Okay. So I'm hearing these questions. Okay. Because sometimes people ask a question and they take up like. I get it. It's a pitch, not a question. Yeah. No, I don't want to buy a house from you. Yeah, they're a pitch area. So let's be real. Okay. Right at the function point. I think I saw this content here recently and it said it's no longer just post content. You need to level up and create it. So the science around art, what do people know? What are you seeing right now? Because all of us are getting less views than ones who are posting. Then we did last year. That's right. And it will continue to happen because it's supplying demand of attention. Right? If everybody listens to me and everybody posts four times a day, and there's only still the same amount of hours of people on the other side, everyone's going to get less views. Right? So you're right. So many of you have heard, especially with all those hands for 10 years, I'm so on this three, four times a day, but to your point, I'm starting to change the message a little bit. This is why I love Q and A because I didn't do it on stage. And you've got to be great at it. It'd be like me telling you you have to shoot 100 basketball shots a day. I'm right for you to get better at basketball, but that doesn't mean you're going to be in the NBA. Right? And so talent matters. Some of you are just going to be more talented at this. That's just real life. But I think you can all agree with me on this. No matter what it is, basketball, skiing, cooking, public speaking, running, all of us have different levels where we start naturally with our DNA and skill sets, but all of us can get better at it. I have a sports agency, NFL, UFC, baseball. We have 150 professional athletes and the biggest sports in the world. Do you know what the most, the number one story at dinner when I get to know them? All of them, not all of them, but so many of them are like, I can't believe I'm in a league. There were so many kids I grew up with that were so much more talented than me, but everyone's the same sentence next. I just outworked them. I had more discipline than them. So many of you in this room, I know will really resonate with what I'm just saying. Many of you sit here today because you outworked everyone. I just want you to get more upside. And so I want you to work better and hard. And I think the better move for this industry is content around your services, around your neighborhoods. Like that's the thing that everyone's about to say, right? What do I post? You put out the best content you can that you think will bring value to people and it will grow, bless you. And so Sally and Vegas needs to constantly talk about the Vegas market on a daily basis. She needs to talk about if she's a real estate agent, the school system on a constant basis. She needs to interview the principal. She needs to talk about the best locations. She needs to educate people why the price was six years ago this much, what she thinks, but she has to hedge and follow legal rules of what she sees. Sally needs to be creative and think and talk. Sally needs to interview former people that she sold homes to to ask them how they like the neighborhood and what they like about it. Not for that person to give an infomercial for Sally. No, just to have a conversation. So another human being whose husband or wife just got relocated to Vegas stumbles upon that video and like those two people seem nice and Sally's the agent, let me DM her. Business. The same reason all you fuckers went to the fucking, like the little link shit and the chamber of commerce and you're like, honey, we gotta go to this thing cause I might get a client from it. You know the real life stuff you did for networking? That's the internet. And good news, you don't have to put clothes on. Like think about all the networking all of you have done. Charity events, little league, like all the stuff. That is social and it scales more. What I'm noticing now here is a lot of the people who are winning, who have been following you like myself for many years now and who are winning more on social is. You said like, good for finding a voice you got the voice already. But what I found in reality was I was not comfortable. So you said, hey, you're the guy that isn't comfortable. So maybe you should be writing. I was terrified, I was like, if you saw these videos, they're cringe. But what I found was at some point I got comfortable being myself. So I think right now a lot of people who are winning are just, they just said fuck it. I'm just gonna be me. And then for some reason, I think the audience can tell very quickly right now that Google is not. Of course, of course. And like by the way, when people are always like, but Gary you have to be more professional. I'm like in real professionalism, the real business is done when you lose to the tie at dinner anyway. You have the professional meeting and then you actually do real business over the steak dinner. In professionalism you have the meeting but then actually like getting to know someone on the golf course is when you really, you're not wearing a suit and tie on the golf course. Like and so it's funny, it's a very meta thing for me. When I started my public speaking career in 2007, eight, nine and then I started popping off in 2009, 10, CAA was my representation at the time for public speaking and they would hound me every six months. Gary you can't wear jeans and a hat and a t-shirt. Gary, you can't curse. This is gonna kill your speaking career. But the world went in my direction. We're more casual. We just are, sorry. And so this is what's working. The most. And so I find this. By the way the point of the stat story is because I want you all to hear this. By the way, what if you're on the other side? The world's gone more casual and you love to suit it up, then suit it up. That's you. You understand? Like you will not trick the audience. You friends, actually this is life advice that I really believe in. Do you know who you trick? Other losers. You don't trick the audience. You can trick them for a few minutes. They're not who you wanna win with anyway. Just be you. For the youngsters that raise their hand, the under 30 crew, for you, don't, like a lot of under 30 in this space will dress up and will get the watch and the cause, because they feel like they need those things because they're young. People know you're young. Even if you wear a fucking suit. Like, there's a lot of people in this room that will outflank you because they have more experience. But you have other shit. And like, don't fake it. Like, you've been in it for two years. This is what you got. But I'm sure you could tell them like, look, I'm not gonna, I cross every T and I. I'm good at detail. I'm this and some people go with you and some won't. And news alert, you're gonna be old one day too. So you're gonna be able to play that card one day. So the reality is like too many people fake it, brother. And so this is the thing that's working right now is the, like for so many people here, you're looking at how many fathers you have or somebody who's in this room who's a couple years ahead of the end of the game and they said, I can't do that. Well, you know, rewind, period, it's all based on the individual merit of a single piece of paper. It's crazy. It's crazy. And you see so many people get started and they blow up and other people, not so much. And so I'm wondering if they create it, it's just based on how good the piece of paper is. That's it. And part of that is like, what you guys spend a lot of money on your team obviously you do that personally, but then also across all the brands that Vayner works with. Yeah, so for an update. Yeah, what's actually working with that? So just for context for everybody, a lot of people, even the ones that have been following me for 10 years don't know this. I'm the active CEO of one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. So VaynerMedia and VaynerX, we have 2,700 employees in the US, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Japan, Sydney, Australia. So these guys come to you and they're like, hey, we don't want to let these partners eat our lunch. What do we do? How are you inviting them? What's working in their objective sales? They're problem with the Fortune 500 companies that I work with, the Pepsi's, the Procter & Gamble's, the Ford's, they still believe in commercials over everything. So they're getting outflanked because they come to me and I tell them what to do, but they want it to look good. I'm like, do you want it to look good and nobody sees it? Or do you want it to look authentic and everyone sees it? They're like, number one. What about the Zillow's? For example, Zillow has a TBI and they're known as a quality company, but I don't really see them on social. But like this is a really, really something. Zillow won because they outflanked everybody on Google. They outspent everybody on Google and they did what OpenTable did to restaurants. They sat on top of all of you and became the toll booth to all of you. They won the Google era. If Zillow doesn't adjust to the era we're now, they will slowly decline, especially in an AI world where why do you think the biggest tech companies are all in on AI? Once all of you, how many people here now use an AI bot instead of Google to search stuff? Raise your hands. Stand up. I apologize. Please stand up. That really, Dustin, I need you to stand up and come on stage with me. I need this, please, please come here. I apologize everyone. Dustin, come on. No, not you, the camera. No, no, I need you to capture this. You can come up here. I want you to get this. This is remarkable. This is actually, this is actual, I'll do it. I got this shit. Thank you, Dustin. This, please stand, I apologize, I know, but please stand back up. Everybody who does it now. Everyone who's sitting, look at this, because it might shock you. Some of you have never been on chat, GPD or Proplexity or anything. Look how many people are standing right now. Just to remind everybody, as I'm looking around, let me just make sure, yep, these are not 20 year olds. And look how many people in this room are now using AI, chat, GPD, Proplexity, other things to look up stuff, not Google. That should scare the fuck out of Zilla. And that's a good thing for us, isn't it? This is, this is, this is, again, this is fun because having so many people that have been following me for a long time, I know you can tell my energy's a little bit, I'm always hyper and excited. There's an urgency in my voice that I hope you hear. This is this room's moment. There's many people here, and again, because I'm looking at everyone's face, especially for people that want like a 10 to 15 year window of prosperity, because of where they are in their life, I want this so bad for you. Like sitting here, like again, if I was a medical doctor, it would really devastate me because you would have patients like please lose this weight, please eat better, please get off alcohol, and then they die, and you're devastated. That's this, I'm the business version of this, I'm looking here and I'm like, they don't understand that if they don't take this serious, the next two, four, six, 10 years is gonna be challenging, and that just sucks. It sucks to have a long career, to do your thing, put in all those deposits, and then lose half your market share because you didn't advance with technology. But to remind you, you're not special. This happened to bookstore owners. You didn't cry for bookstore, like if you're sitting here and saying impossible, that's what bookstore owners said when they heard about the internet, because it was a fad, and then Jeff Bezos picked on them first. I spoke at a conference just like this, three months after Uber came out in Washington, DC, called the Taxi and Black Limo Association. I know some of you've heard the story, I'll never forget it, and I told them, I'm like, this Uber thing, I'm telling you, and they sat here laughing at me until they started crying. They thought they had a moat. One of the guys, even in Q and A, said, Gary, you don't get it. He goes, I have a medallion in New York City. There's nothing they can do about it. We own City Hall. I'm like, do you know Silicon Valley? He goes, no. I go, do you know how much money Silicon Valley has? You think you own City Hall? My friends, I don't care how good your reputation is, and you've been doing it for 15 years, convenience is king. So, when you talk about making better videos, and the authentic ones are doing better, you guys spend a lot of money on paid media. Yes. Some of us here are trying to get old history, but then there's a lot of people in this room who are not down on their paid media. Love that. Love that. Is it the same thing? Is it the paid media? Because you talked about this, I'm primarily organic just now getting me to pay, but I noticed that when we do pay, it gets way cheaper if the video's better. Can you explain this to us? Yeah, so the game was always make ads, run paid against it, see how it does, customer acquisition costs, tweak it. Now the game is go organic, and when something does remarkable, put paid behind it, because you've already seen, that because the AI algorithms have gotten so good. When I used to have seven, you know, five million followers on Instagram, four years, seven years ago, and I would post every day, they would all get 500,000 views roughly. Remember, I told you earlier, it was like email marketing, a certain percentage would see it. So I didn't really know which one of those to put paid against because it wasn't validated by the numbers of which video was hitting more. Occasionally something would go viral. Now the variable, when you leave, if you go to my TikTok, if you go to my Instagram, you'll see the numbers are all over the place. Some are doing great, some are doing atrocious. So what's great about the algorithm now is when the video does well, the AI technology, the algorithm, the artificial intelligence is so good, it knows that people like this video, that gives you complete affirmation to spend more on the ad. So the game is flipped. So is the strategy would be organic? This is why I'm obsessed, think about where I'm going. You have to become remarkable at organic because it's free, and it will grow your business anyway. But when you hit pay dirt, and you've got something that's remarkable, and you're into advertising, well that's what you put your money against it, which means you're saving a lot of money on the thing that was always the hardest thing about advertising, which was the creative, was the variable of the risk. You can get in front of, by the way, I'm giving a talk right now, I've got all your attention, but if I was talking nothing interesting, and nothing good, and you were bored, then the ad didn't do well. So I can get you in front of people with paid advertising, this is what I tell my big clients, they're like, we wanna spend $10 million on this, I'm like, this video sucks. I can get $10 million worth of people to see it, but nobody's gonna buy shit because this video is a fucking commercial. Do you guys even see commercials anyway? Who watches regular TV? What are we doing here? Yeah, so when you think about the comic I care or the gallery, I post 10 videos, one of the 10 videos did 8x videos, what do I do with that video? I think there's two things that depends what you want, if you just wanna keep building brand, then you just spend media on it against the demo you want. So if you wanna grow in California, or you can run it just to people in California. I'm gonna do the same video, or you'll be shooting that video. Same video, but if you wanna sell something, then you take that video and you tweak it a little bit with a call to action, maybe a banner overlay at the bottom of it that says go to, you change the copy, maybe the video, you add something to the end of the video that says 20% off or first consultation for free, or what I think a lot of you should be, I've got a big one for a lot of you, most of you should be running social media ads or start with organic and then ads to host dinners in your town that people submit for. Let me break it fully down. If I'm you, if I did what you do for a living and I'm trying to either get real estate agents from B2B mortgage side, or I'm a real estate agent and trying to sell homes, it's kinda hard to go right in for the kill, right? Those ads don't do as well. If I'm you, I go make a relationship with a restaurant in town and tell them I can bring really good people to this restaurant, I just need a little bit of a discount, either give me the private room for free or hook me up with some, you know, BizDev, a little local BizDev, and then you're running ads to your website or to your social where you're telling people doing a free business dinner, not a real estate agent, doing a free business get together, business people in a 20 mile radius, please go to this forum and fill out who you are if you're interested for a free dinner and some good wine, and that's it. You will get six to eight people all the time, people are always trying to network. Those people are trying to sell some shit to you too, right? And, but then you're gonna have them submit the form so you can see everybody what's your social, and literally you're now hosting really smart six to eight person dinners, plus you're being seen by everybody in the general area. That's a good spend of a hundred bucks. Because by the way, a hundred dollars on Facebook or Instagram in a 10 mile radius will get you fucking good shit. That's what these fucking people do. You know, this isn't my Pepsi client, they're trying to sell to everybody everywhere. The best part about all of you is you're local. You don't need to run ads to everyone. That's another thing that everybody here worries about. Gary, even though I got a thousand views, they're all North Dakota and I'm fucking Jamaica. I'm like, yes, that happens, but less and less now. And by the way, back to the motto, I'm telling you, but we know that people liked it, so now take that and run $50 worth of media in Oklahoma or California or this, got it? Organic gives you the creative affirmation and then you go on the offense. Awesome, and I want to give you the many examples. So this is what I love about Jamaica is it gets you into something you didn't think about, it gets you so excited. So Gary's talking about this right now. Recently, bro, I posted this video on social media. It was about the crazy things that were happening in Las Vegas. All of a sudden, I don't know why it took off like three weeks after I posted it, and all the people who were commenting and sharing it are people who worked with Las Vegas. Why didn't you say it was an app? It showed it to people. You've been in the game long enough to know this is the phenomenon I'm trying to explain to everyone. Social media three years ago looked very different than social media today. And with the advancements of AI, I'm about to blow your mind. Ready for this one? This one I'm very excited about. The image recognition software capabilities that Facebook and TikTok and Google are working with, now you're literally, literally going to make a video. This gentleman's wearing a really rad shirt, right? Yeah, you bro, you should know that. It's crazy shirt. This Hawaii shirt, right? He's gonna make a video. That video, based on what he just said about Las Vegas, which was impossible four years ago, the platforms, when it starts going to whomever, some of his followers, random people, if it gets going, do you know that that video is gonna start hitting people that actually bought that same t-shirt? Because it's gonna recognize what it is, and especially this why Amazon can build the biggest company in the world, they have all that data. Wait till you see what Amazon Prime does. You think your phone and Alexa follow you around, wait till you watch TV in three years. You're gonna be watching TV, you bought some shit four minutes ago, and the commercial's gonna be right there, like they've got it all stacked. Well, what's a favorite? I can tell people, hey, here, they're the biggest Las Vegas Raiders fan, just simply wear the jersey or hat on your videos. And then all of a sudden they get more deals in Las Vegas. So is this why, like it's actually picking up the thing here and it's putting that out to the people about the same interest? Yes, my friend. I can't even tell if the platform's- It's just starting. My friends, please, the opportunity is substantial. It's free. It's free. I need all of you who've been lally gagging, who did it four years ago and said, didn't work for me, or the ones that have just like, do it a little bit. I need you to allocate a hundred hours of learning. Before you start posting, go learn. You have to be good at it. The first second matters. The thumbnail matters. The copy matters. What time you post matters. Are you posting a carousel or a regular post? There's a, for a lot of you, there's a lot to learn. Even the ones that have been doing it for a while, there's a lot to learn. And then it's platform by platform. People have no clue how big Facebook is right now. Facebook is a monster. But every good young marketer thinks it's old school, so they're focused on TikTok and Instagram. That's your opportunity. Like, it's a big deal. And so I think to wrap up your question, this is totally off topic. Okay. I want to be able to, you know, in the beginning of your content, what I really liked about it was that the hustle and bustle was like the culture, I was working on it, it was work hard. I needed it as you work. Yep. And you put in the hours. Yes. And then the thing that I found in my journey about entrepreneurship is I said I was doing this for my family. Yep. And then I started doing it for myself as well. But then my family told me we were single. Where are you? I was like, fuck, are you? Yeah. Straight up. Yeah, because every workaholic does it for their family, but what they're really doing is because they fucking love the game. But your family met it, it's my opportunity. No shit! Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But that doesn't mean that it's still true that you're doing it for your family. You're doing it for yourself because you can't, I don't know, but for a lot of you I'm sure because it's what you do for a living, so a lot of you are very entrepreneurial and entrepreneurs. When you're a purebred entrepreneur, you don't know how to breathe if you're not doing it. Yeah, I was. And so, So this is, I've had to struggle that I'm not on this, you guys have the same struggle. Of course. And so a lot of us have this thing in reaction. Many people when I talk to them one-to-one in our groups, they're going through it right now. Yeah, yeah. And so, how do you? Easy. Stop being full of shit. And be accountable. If you're worried that you're missing time with little Susie or your wife or husband or Johnny, then don't skip Johnny's fucking baseball game to go close a deal. Go to the fucking baseball game. I've done it. I've done it by doing both. I can only give you a focus group of one. I've done it by doing both. I'm not one of these people that put the ideology of not missing a single thing that my kids ever do on a pedestal. And I'm not someone who wants to wake up in 10 years and see my kids look at me and be like, who the fuck are you? So I do the best I can. I try very hard to choose family over everything. I have real boundaries like weekends and families and birthdays. And I'm sure just like every parent on earth, my kids are still gonna shit on me when they're under 20s and 30s about it. But I'm gonna know when they're shitting on me that I really did the best that I could. I also tried to change along the way. I'm dealing with that marketing, day trading attention. I'm also day trading the truth of my family. Things change. Different moments need different time. But I think where we lost in the world, politically, parenting, ideology, is we've become too extreme. You've got people like, I've got friends who are like, I don't miss a single thing. I'm like, okay. Like they walk around like it's a huge, it's wonderful. I'm like, but you're going out of business over here. So it's gonna be a problem. And then there's other people who miss everything and they're like, I'm doing it for my family. And they're like, mm, you know, when your kids shit on you, when they're older and you know, I'm 48 now. So I've got friends who got 15, 16, 19 year olds and they're starting to hear things. The best part about life is you have to sleep in the bed that you made. And so what would I say when you all get into circles and cry about it? Stop crying. And either you're posturing to look good in front of everybody, but you don't really mean it. Because if you mean it, then fucking change. That's a great question. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
