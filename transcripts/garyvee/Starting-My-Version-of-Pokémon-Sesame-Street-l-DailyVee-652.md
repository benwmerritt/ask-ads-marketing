Could you sponsor me? How? Give you money? Shout me out. Like why? Because I need money. Maybe I could just give you money. Sure. There's 10 bucks. There's another 10 bucks. There's 100 bucks. Thank you. Can I tell you something? Yeah. Earning shit feels a lot better than just being given it. How old are you? 10. Like that $120 at 10, you're excited. But I promise you, when you get 15, you get 20, you'll feel better that you actually made it yourself versus some random guy gave it to you. If you get into the habit of just trying to get it quick and short without you actually earning it, you're never gonna get what the fuck you want. I day trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Like documented. The V-Friends booth has been popping for the last three days with tonight being the night of the Big C and C Tournament. But before showing you more of the game, here's Gary to explain how this all started. Let's start from the top. In 2018, I was gonna make a toy called Workplace Warriors because I got so many DMs from people that were miserable at work and they hate their boss, they hate their coworkers, they hate their job. I said, this is fucked up. Then I noticed when I would go to the bathroom in the office, like every single desk had fucking Simpsons toys, marble toys, Disney toys. I've always been fascinated by IP and pop culture. You know what? I'm gonna make some toys called Workplace Warriors to cheer people up. I got busy and then COVID hit. So it's sad on the show. Then NFTs come out. I'm like, fuck, you know what? I'm gonna bring back that Workplace Warriors idea. Got to work, started thinking. And then I came up with the V-Friends concept, which is strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends. Friends become family. I'm really a Sesame Street meets Pokemon if I'm being to the point as I can be. So I launched this two years ago, created these characters. Originally I drew them. Now they've been converted into this character form that you see, created a TCG, doing animation. I'm trying to build a really cool non-sports card brand. And I'm really enjoying it. Now back to the show. ["Dustin'"] Dustin, see this? It's kid's talented. He made me a little pudgy. I'm a little bit upset about that, but I do fluctuate. All right, all right, all right. Here we go. This is for Chad. Chad, come on. Holy shit, that's the best core to core back to back. The best three colors I've ever seen. Let's go! Ever, ever. We just launched the official rules running our first beta tournament tonight. 52 competitors, we're excited about it. These are a character for you that doesn't really speaks to you the most. Accountable aunt. I think accountability is the biggest issue in our society right now. We've gotten very good at pointing fingers that it's everybody else's fault. And so I think if I can make people fall in love with the countable aunt, then I can make people fall in love with the countability. And I think a lot of people can get out of dark places once they realize they're in control. That guy's not showing up tomorrow. He went to fish and he's known a long time. He says, you want the booth. First said, I'll take it. But then the fish came to me and said, you take it. He said, six tables. We're going to do the game. Wow, let's go. Tonight. There's 52 contestants. There's Kabine collecting tonight. And they're all getting this. Who ever wins tonight's tournament is going to own the single most valuable de-friends card of all times. This is the other one we're going to destroy. I'm going to eat it. Do it. That's what I was going to say. Or review it. You're going to eat it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, come on. I had some very dark times. And when I started listening to you, I got a whole different mindset of, how lucky I am to just be here. Period. And I needed you to tell me, Pace, what do I need to do to keep growing my YouTube channel? Because I have a YouTube channel. But I still haven't gotten. How much effort do you put in your thumbnails, your titles, your first three seconds? There's crap to this. I need to do more studies of how I can. Now go do the push-ups. I just needed you to tell me. You got it, brother. Thank you. Stay well. Can you sign my candle? Of course. It's the thumb it does. Makes me happy. And then. Do you have full circle that is for me? Yeah. Do you know that the original V Friends was going to be called Workplace Warriors? And it was to have people put these characters on their desk. So you look at it and you think about, I need to give you an impression with that person right now. Right. So I love that it sits on your desk. That means a lot to me. Okay. Hello. What's up? She doesn't know who you are. No worries. I know. I just know you have 3.5 million subscribers. On YouTube? That's right. Could he sponsor me? Sponsor you? Yeah, I have a YouTube channel. How? Give you money? Shout. Like, why? Because I need money. Maybe I could just give you money. Sure. Here's 10 bucks. Here's another 10 bucks. Here's 100 bucks. Thank you. Can I tell you something? Yeah. Earning shit feels a lot better than just being given it. How old are you? 10. Like that $120 at 10 you're excited. But I promise you when you get 15 you get 20. You'll feel better that you actually made it yourself versus some random guy gave it to you. You need to go out and earn your subscribers instead of somebody just giving it to you. If you get into the habit of just trying to get it quick and short without you actually earning it, you're never gonna get what the fuck you want. You understand? Yes. So now you need to start thinking about how do you make videos that are actually good that people want to watch? Instead of hoping Mr. Beast or Clicks gives you a shout out and you win a lottery ticket. Go out and fucking earn it, my man. It will taste better. You're gonna waste that $120 because it came easy. But if you earned it, you would have bought smarter. Give me a hug. Get in here. You understand that? Learn that lesson, my dude. What's your YouTube channel? It's Gary Vaynerchuk. I know you won't remember that. Yeah, I won't. But don't worry. One day you will know. Thank you. You're welcome. Man, let's shut it down. Guys, we gotta shut it down. We gotta tournament tonight. We gotta go. Good luck. Here we are, man. Here we are. I'm dying to see who's gonna win. Killing you not to play? Killing me. I wanna play so fucking bad. Welcome to the inaugural compete and collect tournament. I just wanna thank all of you. This feels incredibly special. At night, I think we will all remember. I'm extremely excited for the winner, especially with what they're getting. But we're going into a tournament now. This is serious. And good luck. Thank you. You guys are asking. I came in here confident. And you've got annihilated. It wasn't even close. Wow. That means you're gonna get more into it. But how are you feeling right now? Confident or concerned? Confident. How are you feeling? Double confidence. I like it. Rips, early into the tournament, what are you feeling? Right now, people are strategic. It's not so simple when you gotta cut your hearts. It's about getting into the bluff. First time ever people playing in the market, you've seen a group of a lot of eye contact. Well, speaking of eye contact, somebody came prepared. There will be no seeing the eyes of this man. People are learning a lot of people that lost have already realized their mistakes and they're chomping to play again. That's a good sign for a game. Absolutely. I think we're having a good first tournament with a lot of our original OG family members which makes me happy. I'm excited for the winner. We've got some good players. Dalton, you were the worst player even though you were an elite eight. That is true. He's very upset. That is the face of a man who was in the elite eight and feels like he should be in the final four. Get to it. Oh no! The first. Oh shit. Let's clap it up for the finals. Let's clap it up for the finals. Oh shit. What are we gonna talk about? We'll talk about two different items we have here. How many people here have been part of the Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Dragon Balls, and you can raise your hands. So, most of you are pretty aware what tournament winning cards and things of that nature. Trophy cards. Trophy cards. We're so thrilled to be able to make this for you. Graded. I'm just so excited all of you have this and I hope you hold onto it and cherish it. 52 of those were made. What we're about to tell you, there was only one made up. The biggest moment in the history of V-Friends trading cards happened today when this card came back to us. Graded in a manner that we did not expect. The first ever champion of the Pokemon for V-Friends competing to let us start none other than the perfect card you have. One created. And it's a TTC black label. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's time to play rock, paper, scissors. Wow, it's a top of the player. Five minutes later. Oh my God. Stopping. Game over. Come on, let's go. I didn't get enough of that. What happened there in the finals? It was pretty quick. When I saw that Phoenix, when I saw that Phoenix, I was like, odds are it didn't have over a 108. So I was like, I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. So, but I tell you what, every one of these, I thought I was gonna lose. Every single one of these coming into it. How many boxes of competing collect did you open? I'm a journey to the set. Yep. 107. Wow. How many autos did you get in the 107? Zero. Actually, actually, hold on. One. I have good news for you, my friend. You didn't pull that auto. That auto was earned. We just started this. This was the first tournament. Let's fucking go. This game is that new. We have a first champion. Let's touch up for Rahul! Rahul! What a day. We did a tournament, our first ever, in Series 2 V Friends with the NFT. Just like in Series 1, where I did V-Con, I wanted to have a physical item. Something real, tangible. Mixing the Web 3 world and the Web 2 for the analog world. We gave people cards. Here we are 15 months later or so, and we've now really started the process of the vision we had back then, of turning that card not only to be a collectible, but to be a TCG, a trading card game. We threw our first beta tournament today. It went extremely well. We're documenting the building of a brand. From scratch. One that millions and millions of millions of people will know about. And so it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm going to speak to my 85-year-old self right now. He's going to be watching this. These were fun days. You love the dirt. You're from the dirt. I hope you're at a flea market right now in the VR environment, finding a $3 item from V Friends to sell $9 on whatever is the eBay of the day. I know you won't change. When people say to you, don't change. They don't know you. You're not putting them on change. And I'm proud of you. That was neat. Was that neat? That was cool.
