Over 90% of followers come from the feed. The feed to follow. More than 50% of people now don't follow at all anyway. Followers are done. Content now comes to you. No, your grid does not need to be perfect. Jesus Christ with this grid. The fuck is a perfect grid? Making great content that brings value to people that has a good thumbnail and a good first three seconds, good copy and you getting in the comments and building a community answering all your DMs. How about all you fuckers answer all your DMs first? I still struggle to like decide or like choose what to do with my passion. Like I love cooking. I love eating. I've been thinking for so long to like do something around that. And I took so much content. Do you post it? I really want to do things like in regards to that, but also in all the things, but I'm not sure. You're scared that if you post food content that that locks you in and then you can't do skiing and you can't do the friends cards. Do you understand who the fuck I am? I made a thousand wine videos. I was literally referenced as the wine guy. When I started VaynerMedia people like the fucking wine guy thinks he knows marketing. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Nobody even references me as a wine guy anymore. Fuck man. Yeah. Fuck man is right man. Post your food content brother. I want to open up my coffee cart and I want to make like grow gourmet mushrooms and show people like the power that gourmet mushrooms have. Do I need to have like some plan with my content or something? No, go for it. Go for it. You want to show them mushrooms and share your fucking fungus my dude. Fuck yeah. Bro, if you don't post something in the next hour, I'm going to literally get Russian hackers to destroy your life. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to send them the fucking nice. I know you will follow up on it. I will definitely follow up with you. Fuck. You understand? You need to post a video in your main feed right now. Everybody here just said they want to follow you. What is your Instagram? Lost Icelander. Oh, fucking hell. Okay. Yeah, good news brother. Brother, good news. You've been found. Daniel? Daniel, you've been found. You are no longer the lost Icelander. You're the found Daniel. Bro, you've been fucking found. Alex says, I know you say perfect doesn't matter, but my- Cause there's no perfect. Mackenzie, who decides perfect? Of course perfect doesn't matter. It's fake. Do you know that perfect is just like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus? Do you know that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and perfect are all the same? It's fake. There is no perfect. You make it up, but go ahead, finish your question, Mackenzie. But doesn't my grid still need to look good for me to get followers? Your grid? No. You know what's better than perfect? Being smart and knowing shit. Followers are done. Content now comes to you. No, your grid does not need to be perfect. Jesus Christ, with this grid, shit. The fuck is a perfect grid? Making great fucking content that brings value to people that has a good thumbnail and a good first three seconds, good copy and you getting in the comments and building a community, answering all your DMs. How about all you fuckers answer all your DMs first? People got like 13 fans, trying to get a million and don't give a fuck about their 13 fans. Oh, oh now we're hitting hard. That just hurt a lot of people's fucking feeling. I didn't say feelings, I said singular feeling. You have 13, you motherfuckers have 13 fucking followers dreaming of a million and don't have time to reply to DMs or comments in your posts. I feel like I can make a difference by getting a doctorate or master's degree, but I'm also a creative person and don't like feeling tied down. What should I do? Oh, Toby B, is that you? It's me, yeah. Throw her up. Are you collecting debt to be in college? It's dumb. It's mostly my mom paying it off, but I'm okay. Understood. No bullshit. What percentage of 100% of why you're in college is deep down honestly, truthfully, because you know your mom is so proud because you didn't get the opportunity and you're fulfilling that. 20%. Okay, not bad, not bad. So not incurring huge debt, right? So okay, so you're not collecting debt, you're only 20% in because you're mom. Is that 20% enough to ask this question? Are you not enjoying it? You're a junior now. Listen, I fully believe more than half the kids on earth should not go to college. I believe that with my entire soul. I know that people get upset about that. I believe I'll be historically correct. I think 10 years ago when I was saying this, Tyler Sid, you know, 10 years ago when I was saying this, I got shit on. Now people are like, wait a minute. And I think in 10 years people are like, how the fuck did he know? I'm telling you, I really don't think it works for a lot of people. If you're creative, it's a real fuck show. This whole concept of like, well, you learn how to be social. You can learn how to be social, not at fucking college. Or you can go fucking tour Europe or go to South America, go to Thailand and learn to be social. I want everybody here to be nice and slow. For some people, college is remarkable. Remarkable from the education thing, need the degree to go into the field that is their destiny. I do not believe college is bad for everyone. I just don't think college is for everyone the way we were taught in the 70s and 80s. Now that we have the internet, social media, the blockchain and all these technologies. The thing that I'm most interested in is, why did you even ask the question? I'm at that point where I have to start thinking about what my next step is. And so that's really where it's coming from. So you think it's more of a strategic, like what am I supposed to do? And like maybe quitting college is one of the things I'm supposed to do? Possibly. I thought about quitting college almost every year, but now I'm thinking I may just finish it because it'll make my mom proud. I get it, you're close. Maybe if I again, if I'm going. But I honestly, like I enjoy some of it, but I feel like this is not it for me. Again, but when I practice, I practice like later on, it's different than studying it, so I don't know. Look, I think you're so close that there's a part of me that says like, if you're only 20% in for your mom and you're not collecting debt, you could go into vacation mode and milk it, because it's the last vacation of your life. The second you go into the real world, it's real world. No sleeping through classes, no bullshitting, no partying. Like you can party or all that, but you know what I mean? So who won? Frodo! Frodo with a massive win! And OG with a massive win! Congrats Frodo, that's unbelievably exciting. Toby, thank you, go enjoy your vacation and then go live life. See ya. How do I better reach my local market so I can get more leads? By taking the videos that do well and then converting it into an ad and running it on a 10 mile radius. Pablo! Get over here. He's on Team Gary and he runs my ads. And I will say, and I could see the pride in Sid's eyes, because we've done a lot of different people with paid and people have done nice jobs, but this man has come in and worked. I'm proud of you. And he's doing a great job. And I can tell you the variable of his skills, the ads will work better the better you are. Like it's a simple zap, Pablo's good at it and he's going in and he's not just taking general direction from me and Sid and J-Mo and Will Taylor. He's going in deeper. He's making his own observations. He's using his fucking brain, which oh by the way, if you're fucking scared of AI, I've got great news to you. If you use your fucking brain, you'll be fine. If you don't, AI will fucking destroy you and pierce through your heart. But if you use your fucking brain, you're good. Pablo's using his fucking brain and he knows how to run ads in a 10 mile radius and he takes the content that does well and that's what Greg needs to do. Thank you Pablo. Pablo will not get killed by AI. Other people in my company will. The simple as that, I'm dead fucking serious. Everyone who's scared of AI, do not be scared if you use your brain. If you use your brain, if you're creative, if you're strategic, if you think AI is not a problem. In fact, it's going to be your enhancer, it's gonna be your best friend. If you don't use your fucking brain and you're still a student as a grown up, memorizing shit, parroting things that are said, but you have no fucking idea what is being said, lally gagging, cutting fucking corners. AI is coming. You're mad at your boss. You're scared of bosses catching you. You don't have to worry about bosses ever again, my friends. AI is gonna kill you. Good news, no more trying to trick bosses. It doesn't matter anymore. In the next decade, AI is just gonna kill you. So that's that, that's the fucking answer. We started YouTube in sub-sec, but where do you see the future of search traffic going? Declining heavily. Guys, search is in trouble. It's called fucking AI chat. Is anyone confused in here? Is there anyone confused in here? In the chat, tell me if you've now used chat, gpt or perplexity or something else for searching something or even a social networks AI instead of going to Google. Have you done that? JJ is the only no I've seen. Everybody now does both. It's not like search, don't get it twisted. Search engines are not dead, they're dented and they'll continue to dent. When I told everybody to get on search engines in 99, 2000, it was do that and have a yellow pages listing. But by 2005, it was like, you don't need a fucking yellow pages listing. I was with a bunch of residents yesterday. More than half the room had never heard of the yellow pages. And if your business relies on search, on Google AdWords, you better get very deep on brand building. If you don't build brand, you're not gonna show up because search is sales, search is referral. I got a good one, I'm doing a giveaway. All of you get over to GaryVee.com slash what not to enter this giveaway. Do you know who Brett the Hitman heart is and do you know who Shawn Michaels is? They came up the game as part of a tag team championship known as the Heart Foundation for Bret Hart with Jim the Anvil Knightheart. And for Shawn Michaels, it was Marty Genetti and they were known as the Rockers. That was their brand. They broke up and Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart went on to have a much bigger, even though they got massive as a tag team, became even more famous, more successful, more accomplished as an individual wrestler. Our friend here needs to become Bret Hart or Shawn Michaels. My friends, when you're in a duo, when you break up, become Bret Hart, edit and become Shawn Michaels, edit. And that's how you live life. I'm 79 but looks exe-ish in the face and body. I need to be- And body, that's the best part. Good. I need to be an influencer for financial reasons. I've listened and admired you for a while but was cowardly to start. Now I have no choice but to do something and quickly I don't know where to start. By making content, by going to GaryVee.com slash attention. She's 79, you're wise. But she looks 60 in the face and the body. GaryVee.com slash attention. Etsy has recently shut my, I'm sorry, I'm getting emotional. Last year, my husband was in heart failure, had to have a deep, deep fib put in. I got breast cancer. So sorry. Etsy shut my shop down. It was like a six figure business. Why did they shut it down? I was gonna have a ride on Christmas day. You know, the year was a shithole but- So wait, so wait, how are you feeling physically? Let's break this all down. First of all, how are you feeling? Great. I'm more blessed than anyone on the planet, honestly. And this entire journey has been, it's just been kind of interesting and cool to kind of go through. And I'm really glad I'm going through all of this. And so I had a double mastectomy and- Look at this. Everything's great. Yeah. Gang, I wanna send a signed resilient Red Devil hat to her. No. Yes. No way. Yes, cause she is truly the resilient Red Devil. I love you, we'll set that up. You got that team? You'll get her address and all that? Here, give it to me. No way. Yes, Etsy. Yeah. No bullshit cause I have relationships there and I don't want you to make me look like an idiot. Was Etsy right to ban you or is it complete randomness? I have a metal shop and I have metal signs in decor and I have a lot of people asking for collegiate stuff and I told them I was like, I'm not licensed. So I can't- Licensing, got it. Got it. So I didn't do logos. I did hand signs. So you know, like case, I'm a case theater. So that's case day, Texas. Got it. Texas tech. And so I started doing those and I contacted an attorney and he said, you can't license a hand sign. And so I continued to do it. Somebody contacted me who was the licensing agency for case day and University of Houston and they said, you got to take it down. And I was like, well, my attorney says you can't license a hand sign. And they went to Etsy and boom, boom. Right, which is fine. They took it down. I didn't do anything. I was like, okay, whatever. But then all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, boom. Vanderbilt was- I got it. Listen to me. Yeah. Send me an email to gary at vfriends.com. Okay. With the username of the old shop. Write it in detail. Be honest. Let me see if I can help you. I love you. I love you too. Now- I can hug you. You can hug me virtually and mentally. Number two, you've got to start selling on this platform. Yeah. I just, once I got on here, this is my first time on here with you and I got on my computer while I was listening to you setting up my profile and everything. So- I'm proud of you. This is gonna blow you away with this can be. I worked at Papa John's for a while and I was the top general manager there. I was strong with food and labor so I know I can keep my costs down. But damn, if this was my last 100K, would I open up a shop or would I mortgage out a house? I believe that you want to open the pizza shop but you think the right thing to do is buy the house. That's what I believe. Yeah, I definitely want to open up a shop but I just feel like the house is the way to go. Why? Because what if it's the only last 100K I ever have? You know what I mean? It's a mortgage, I can mortgage out a house. Bro. Bro. And it have a roof over my head, you know what I mean? You can rent an apartment and have a roof over your fucking head. I have an apartment already. I bought for 85K. It was a good move. I saved up some money from Papa John's. It's something my dad left me before he passed away. I'm sorry about your loss, bro. Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm confused now. You already got an apartment but you're trying to buy it. And you own an apartment. Right. You better fucking open up a pizza shop, J-O. I'm gonna beat your fucking ass. You motherfucker. Get the fuck out of here, J-O. Build a fucking pizza shop, bro. Because people ask me, they say, would you do, would you, because I love dogs, you know? So they say, would you open something up with dogs? I'm like, no. Would you open up a steakhouse? No. Would you open up with Jim? No. But would you open up a pizza shop? I say, yeah, I would. Do you think you can fucking build a successful pizza shop? Do you know how to find a prop? Do you feel like you, you know how to run one? Do you think you know how to find a good location so you're not fucked from the get? Of course. I looked at the location and it was like, damn, I got like an area of about 450,000 people I could deliver to. And that's just delivery, you know, there's carry out. Where would you, where would you build it? It'd be Lottardale Lakes. Papa John's Lottardale Lakes makes 60K a week. If I could make half of that, I'm good. What about, what about a fucking pizza truck first with a little less risk and a little bit more mobility? Thoughts on that? I don't know if I would make, I would get a truck. I would rather put to a location. Neither is exactly right. What's right is what's right for you. J.O. listen to my face. Open the fucking pizza shop. Bro, you can live in an apartment for your whole life, but I have a very sneaky feeling in my Gary V. Intuition stomach. How many hours are you gonna work in that pizza shop when you open it? Oh, I dedicate my life to it. I was, when I was a worker, I worked 50 plus, sometimes even 70 hours. I made over a thousand dollars as a shift leader in a week. Are you in for a buck 50 a week? I mean, yeah, I do whatever I gotta do. So what are we even talking about here? Who doesn't want you to open the pizza shop? Tell me. No, it's, there's no, I got a lot of support. My mom supports me, but she thinks the house is a better move. Of course she does. She's your mom. Mom's play defense. Entrepreneurs you look up to play offense. So who are you? An entrepreneur or a mom? Are you gonna hang up and in two days, like forget all this energy and then buy a house? Tell me the truth. I just need to know. I don't know. I'm really into this house idea. This really got me like, damn, I could have a house at 30. Good buy a house. And invite me to the house for you. Yeah, good bro. Buy the house. That's what you should do. I appreciate it. Invite me to the house opening. So I can come there and shit on you. I love you bro. Good luck. Oh, by the way, Jail, let me give you the preview. When you're 60, you're gonna think about this conversation your whole life and regret not opening the pizza shop. I just need you to know that right now. I don't know. Good news, I do know. I'm telling you right to your fucking mouth. You were gonna think about this conversation your whole fucking life if you buy this house and regret it your whole life. I'm telling you to your fucking face. Fuck. All right, let's move on. Another one lost at sea. God damn it. We asked AI to ask you some questions. AI? Yeah. All right, AI. So you asked GPT to ask me some questions. And Gemini. And Gemini. All right, let's see who's first. Gemini or GP? All right, Gemini, go ahead, ask your question. How do you foster a culture of innovation within your organizations? And how do you encourage calculated risk taking? By me actually doing it, right? Think about how you've all been affected. I talk a whole lot. Man was right early. Johnny55, my guys, you've been talking for 10 years. You're absolutely right. I've also been doing for 10 years. When I talk about work ethic, half of you were with me last night at one o'clock in the morning when I left studio. I'm back in chair. People ask me why I'm still working a lot of my circle. Not only am I working, I'm working in the dirt. This is in bougie breakfast with executive fancy person. I'm in the fucking dirt. I'm in the trenches. How do I foster a culture of innovation? I fucking innovate, Mackenzie. When I fucking launched an NFT project, all my employees are like, what the fuck is that? When I do live shop, everybody in the company is like, we should start strategizing about live shopping. I'm like, motherfucker, I've been live shopping. I am the innovator. How do I foster a culture of it for my employees? By fucking living it. Most bosses suck because they talk but they don't live it. I think people that build personal brands are going to have even bigger wins. They're gonna have the ability to make their teams that make content for them and work with them and make them more effective. Personal brands are gonna put out more content. I'm gonna put out 40,000 posts a day, not four. Why not? As we get the tools, right? Some people are gonna be able to have teams without having teams at first with agents. Like, it's gonna be a whole new world. We've been putting off hiring as we're afraid we'd end up spending way too much time micromanaging any advice. You're on a football team and you're playing middle linebacker right now and cornerbacker safety or defensive end. Become a quarterback or running back a wide receiver. You're on straight defense. Mackenzie, they're worried about wasting time for the opportunity to dramatically grow their business. Could you imagine if me and AJ sat here 15 years ago and said, no one can do social media like us. Here's where people get confused, Mackenzie. You don't need your employees to be as good as you. They don't need to be at your level. It's called scaling. When I was building VaynerMedia, everyone's like, Gary, how are you gonna build this business? Everyone's gonna want you. I'm like, no, they're not. I'm gonna be involved a lot in the beginning. I'm gonna create a lot of osmosis I'm gonna teach and then you let the birds fly. This is incredibly grounded in two things, ego and fear. Fundamentally, you've gotta put in the time to build someone up, then they quit, then they stink, then their spouse moves and they have to leave and you take that micro L and you're building up the next person and the next person. It's called scaling a business. I'm doing all the things, newsletter, TikTok, posts. But how can I extend my reach more to get people to buy this book meant to serve? And let's clap it up for Sandy in her fight. GaryBee.com slash attention is the answer, Sandy, to your question. You have to get good at organic social media, organic social media, organic social media. Okada coup on the giveaway. Okada coup! Let's clap it up for Okada coup! Okada coup with a huge win. Okada coup looks new too. That's a huge win. I work in sales and I don't know how to get ahead. I don't know what to do. Sometimes we have to go through chapters that are hard. Is that him? Oh my God. My man, my brother. Honestly, right now I would not focus on getting ahead. I would focus on persevering. I would focus on maximizing time with your family. I don't know if you noticed with Trisha. Did you see Trisha on the last thing? Yeah. Did you notice how she said at the end that she was grateful through going through her husband, almost dying of a heart attack for her having breast cancer and having a double mastectomy? Yeah. If you were Brandon Warnick, my best friend in the world, I would tell him, hey bro, there's a part of you that needs to even go dark and almost like kind of like embrace the fucking darkness. You know, like become a fucking warrior. Do you understand where I'm going? Yeah. You know what I mean? I feel a little backstory. Please, please, please. So my dad has stage four. It's called neuroendocrine cancer. And you know, it's not cancer, not curable, but he goes through chemo radiation. So I moved to Kentucky for a job opportunity in sales. So right now I'm making like a buck 30, a buck 40. And I did it just to, you know, get help on parents out. And then two months in when I moved here, my mom got lung cancer. So I plan on moving back to Jersey. The only thing I struggle with is like, you know, I guess sometimes I have that imposter syndrome, like can I make the same amount of money? Do I have the skills? And me and my sister, she works in, she's a speech pathologist, so she works in a school. And she makes like 65. So a lot of my money, you know, I have some debt, like I have like 40K in debt. And a lot of my money is, you know, I give to them. And like a part of me feels like I'm not saving a lot. I get it, I get it. Brother, let me just look at my face. I had no savings at 27 and I was doing the same thing in a different way. I just worked fucking my dick off 24 seven for my dad. And he was paying me shit. You're making three times the amount of money I made at 27. You right now make three times the amount I made. That's crazy. You can bro, it's just a chapter. Do you understand? Yeah. And honestly, you're such an honorable dude. I fucking respect you so heavy, bro. I appreciate you very much. You know how many so many people run away from this and do their own thing? You're such a good man. I admire you so much, my brother. I appreciate you. Real talk. You've got one really good partner in this time. You got time. I love you. I love you too, bro. And don't worry about imposter syndrome. Just keep implying for jobs. Hear me out. Five companies in New Jersey are gonna be like, yo, just cause you did it in Kentucky, you can't do it here. We're not paying you shit. And the sixth company is gonna pay you 160. Bro, nose or opportunity, nose or good, nose fucking build character, nose or fucking delicious. But you think moving home is a good idea, right? I think either moving home or frequently flying from Kentucky to Newark and seeing your parents, either or you'll never regret it. God forbid, God's got a plan. So I don't know if you have to move, but if you can fly home, Kentucky to Jersey with the right flights you can get for a good deal. Can you fly home every other weekend and work one day remote for the Kentucky job? Like either move home or be there as much as fucking possible. You want me to give that away as a giveaway? Holy shit. It's giveaway time signed. This is a massive giveaway. The K Swiss sneaker being given away. This is the 001? This is the 001, isn't it? We're giving this away for free right now. Put it up. If I don't get a 712 entries, cause there's 715 of you right now, I'm gonna lose my mind. It's literally click a button, buy this and flip it for free money. Did I actually put in my company name, 911 initiative like on all of my products I get? Or does it matter? Like it's not like Jane Doe's like consulting services because like me, I'm not the biggest fan when people do that. But I also wanna make sure it has the most impact. There's a subtle way to do it. I mean, even look at the hat I'm wearing right now, right? This is obviously be friends. It's heavy, resilient, cause it's cool to wear. And then the little red devil on the side, you could have it underneath here. You could have it in the back patch. So yeah, I think a little branding matters cause you don't wanna be a private label company trying to build what you're building. But to your point, I think too many people blow it and they put their brand way too in the front. It makes it cheesy and nobody wants a rocket. You're actually thinking beautifully. You're thinking like a consumer, right? Which is what you always wanna do. The reason so much has worked for me is I always think about the customer as if I'm the customer. Like what would I do as the customer? And I think most of us don't want over branding on stuff unless we're completely in love with the brand. Why do you think many of my clients have stopped working with me even though I've delivered good results? Because they don't think you delivered good results. There's an old Russian saying my dad used to say to me all the time that translates to whoever pays for the music gets to pick the song. You don't get to decide that you're doing good work. Instead of the audacity of saying or the delusion of saying we did good work, what's happening, you need to go and ask them why. You talk a lot about soft skills, like kindness, empathy and doing the right thing. I'm working at a corporate job and they don't seem to value that as much. So I was wondering your opinion on like the best jobs that care about soft skills. First of all, there is more companies out there that actually care about having a good environment than people realize. The problem is it's still one to 3% of corporations. It's a low number by percentage, but it's a high number overall. The way you find it, I believe, is through word of mouth. I think you've got to find someone you trust to tell you truth, because you know this, we've all been fooled by interviewing an employees, right? They tell you, oh, it's a great environment here. We care about our people. And then a month into the job, you're like, mother fucker, this is a fucking cesspool of politics. You know what I would say is, A, you should be looking for that. And B, the way you find it is through a lot of networking in the Columbus, Ohio area, going to like meetups, work stuff, like there's a lot of ways to get out there and meet people. And I highly recommend that. The mindset of knowing it's out there and the mindset of deciding you're going to actually put in the work. It's work on your end to go find the answers and the places and go on interviews. Even if you don't get a word of mouth recommendation, if you go on interviews, trusting your intuition and asking challenging questions when you're the interviewee, more networking, more interviewing, more looking for it. But like less talking about looking for it, dwelling on it, hoping for it, less thinking and more doing. Of course, there's unlimited people who have massive companies who've never even created a social media account. They're just leaving money on the table. Remember that Facebook movie? You know what's better than a million? A billion? So you could have a trucking company doing 800,000 a year, 4 million a year, but you know what's better than 800,000 McKenzie? 1.6 million. You know what's better than 4 million? 8 million. This is, of course, there's a million ways to build a business. Personal brand, social media, but the amount of businesses that went out of business that relied only on the yellow pages in the 90s and then Google came along, got murdered out of business. If there is a business right now that only gets its business from Google AdWords, they have to change right now. All right, I'm about to do a giveaway for everybody who bought something. I got a big one, Rips. Fuck the bullshit. A $400 box of Series 2 V-Friends. Buyer's giveaway. Sealed box in the cardboard. A $400, look at everybody buying the $15 sticker packs right now to get into the giveaway. A $400 Series 2 box. Actually, they're going to 499 on May 7th. A $400 box is a giveaway right now only for the buyers. And there's only 80 that have entered. Click the enter to giveaway. This is one of the biggest giveaways. You know what?
