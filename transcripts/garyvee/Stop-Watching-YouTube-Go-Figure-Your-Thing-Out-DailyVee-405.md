It's just mental. Tomorrow, go and do something you've been wanting to do. It's not airport care. I'm not gonna put this on. Oh. That you're desperately scared about what your parents, the world, the market, your social media followers will think. Do it. And then see how not scary all the negativity actually is. Either revenue or legacy. I can't be a bum. That can't be my destiny. There aren't right answers. Tomorrow, do the thing that you've been scared to do that is the most practical, not move across the country. Something practical. Start a YouTube page. Tweet about something. Like something, something. You have to understand there's just decisions. There's no right or wrong. Because you don't, let me tell you why. When you make a decision, you don't know what happened of the other decision. Do one thing that makes you uncomfortable. See the reaction from the audience and your inner family and your friends and realize very quickly that it wasn't as scary as you thought. That feedback. To go from here to here, because I'm not even asking you to go to here, you've got to understand there's no right answers. There's just doing. Either revenue or legacy. I can't be a bum. Nah, I can't be a bum. What? It has. I'm an idea. Something just caught my attention. In the meme video, can you have somebody design one that starts the top left is a two times bigger version of my Instagram logo? I think it might stop people even more. The calm before the storm. Yeah. Speaking of New Orleans, to a pretty awesome crew of contractors, insurance, policy executives, and so just ready to rock. Everybody stand up because of the great logo, for David E. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How are you? Good to see you again, man. So he's good to see you, bro. First of all, thank you so much for everything you put out and following, watching what you've been doing for years and being able to build my brand and also my version of that. I love it. Let's stay in the theme of crushing and crushing it. Let's go into a little bit deeper because maybe you'll inspire more than I will. How did that first start? Like give me the details behind that. When did you first find me? Where was that and where were you at and what happened next? So I followed when you broke Crush It and we can't be just a follower, just watch kind of saw what you did, but at that point I was working in the corporate world. Okay. I didn't have my own agency, I didn't have my own company, and certainly didn't have my new company. But watch what you did and saw how you did it very thoughtfully and very real and very humbling, which I thought was a key to this. So just fast forward, I've been following you for years. March 6th, 2017, in a Facebook group, CPA accounting person, in a Facebook group, somebody needed help writing ad copy. You know this story. I went into the group and helped them rewrite their ad in the group, which led to 15 people saying, wow, I wish I could write ads like that. And then I made the stupid mistake of saying you ever need help emailing me up DM me. Yep. That way I can have 100 requests. Yep. And my company was full. Yep. Six months later we hit global scale and you and Dan in October recommended that I get an operations person best fucking advice ever. I'm good at this shit. No, dude, I sent you an email with a snapshot. You saw that email. I did. Our revenue stream, like that since I've gone up grade. Guys, self-awareness, you don't have to be graded everything. You have to be graded figuring out what you're great at and then surrounding yourself with everything else. Humility, you've got your ego caught up in this narrative. It's the same thing about while I've got, excuse me for a second, while I've got you guys hiring. So many of you have not fired somebody that you desperately need to fire because you're the one that hired them and you have more pride in being good at hiring than running a good business. This is the psychology that matters. So my question to you is this. In my breakout presentation, I'm actually showing people how to build that brain. Yes. Can you talk about it? I get it. Just my version of it. I get it. How do I get our customers, our clients to stop giving a fuck about the buy now, click here, get into my funnel and get into the storytelling of their business? You don't. What you do is what I do, which is you're gonna go on a journey of spending a fucking decade exhaustively standing up here yelling and screaming and ranting or calmly or whatever you're doing. All you can do is put out the truth and let the chips fall. You heard me very carefully. Two. My great ambition here is that two of you listened and do. That is some bullshit numbers. There's hundreds and hundreds of people here, but that's what I've learned, which is like, I don't, you can't. What you can do is aspire humbly and authentically to get them there and then just let your skill and talent and work ethic create the legacy of how many people you were able to get there. Right? Look, look how I'm thinking about it. From my tree, it's like a coaching tree. From my tree to you, to you to them. And so for me, there's an enormous amount of pride in how many people I've been able to hit, but some of them may be in your breakout session. I'm here and you're here. Some of the people here didn't get hit by what I said, but maybe in your breakout session do. And honestly, that feels incredible for me because I know where that seed started. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, New Orleans. Thank you. Did you see Mom starting a book? No. She said Mom got asked to sign a book. It's gonna start soon. Mom better start working on her signature. Negativity can be leading at halftime, but positivity always wins championships. Are you taking on new shoes? What's that? Are you taking on new shoes and you set like a new style? Okay, perfect. Three and four, right? Three and four. You just changed me. Thank you, brother. I'll be one of your two. Thank you, brother. Make sense, right? Yeah. Well, I'm a writer. I'm an ex-director. I'm an ex-movie producer and I'm not doing anything with video. I mean, that's fucking crazy. Like the fact that you have that, and you probably like it. I love it. Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah. To me, that is like super interesting. Chances after chances. Stages after stages. Different circumstances now. Break it through the cages. Five of you are in ritual, anything that you can. I have one rule. Try to give more to the other person that I want in return. Every interaction. What about every day before coffee? Anything? Nothing weird. Not for me. But man, I'm doing it every second of my life. I'm trying to give you a better answer than giving you an answer that has value for me. You understand? Give more back than you got. 5149. Appreciate it. Biggest changes in like content. Like you think it's... Audio. Go straight to audio. There's no straight. There's three things. But there's moments where there's spikes and when there's spikes, it's like real estate. There's land grab. There's a land grab in podcasting right now. So I'm not casting? 100%. Oh shit. 100%. We're on Facebook, Instagram. About to get on. I'm trying to push us to get on the YouTube. LinkedIn is like in the works. And so is Twitter. But it's also not just wide, which I believe, but it's deep. Like you could be on Facebook. You could be a contractor. You could be a real estate agent. You could be a basketball player. But are you winning? So you gotta make sure you get your depth down along with your width. Too many people think like, oh, we're gonna add podcasting. We're gonna add this. But like the thing that I think I'm doing well is it's wide and deep. But that's why there's 17 fucking people. And I'm not even happy. Why didn't you talk about it? You know, I think people don't realize to be great, you need both. You need to be wide and deep. You just saw the highlight. That's why DRock is pushing me to expand. A lot of you think the answer is, well, I'll start a podcast this year or I'll start a blog too. Or I'll do YouTube videos too with my Facebook or vice versa. A lot of you are like, oh, now I'm gonna do Facebook, Facebook, watch along with my YouTube. The problem is 99% of you haven't gotten the thing you're doing down, right? So that's the key to me. I think a lot of people are confused by what's working for me. You know, I'm not always just obsessed with doing everything. I'm obsessed with doing everything right and deep and getting the value out of it. But also not being crippled. For example, we had Facebook down a year and a half ago. I don't feel like we have it down. I think we've mailed it in a little bit in a podcast kind of Instagram world back on my team. So now I'm like, oh shit, over here I've gotta go deeper. So it's not only about going wider deep in a moment. It's about going wide and deep at all times and understanding you're pulling those levers. So you're just always getting your game better. It's like being a professional athlete. Like, you know, even the best, the LeBron, the Steph's, the Coveys, they talk about like refining their game and season 12 of a Hall of Fame career. I'm in a Hall of Fame career. I'm trying to get better at every nuance, deeper, wider, always. And too many of you are confused at just adding something, widening it out is the solve, is the unlock. There's no fucking solve or unlock. There's just a fucking process. Thank you. That last clip with that kid, that's gonna really help a lot of people. That's a real clip. Gary here. Just worry about the photography. Worry about your craft, not the algorithm. That's a costume. That is. That's the meme. But now I don't even, now I'm so happy for you. Not for anybody else back home. So it makes me happy. There's no time to post. There's no hashtag. There's no certain content. There's no certain people that follow you. There is no hack. What there is is consistency of like putting out great content. I think the thing that people are missing about the working 20 hour day thing is it's not about that. You have consistently said you just have to be disciplined not to give up. I mean, yes, work hard. But the point is don't work hard and quit. Like work hard for a decade. Be self-aware. Be self-awareness and perseverance and delusion. You know perseverance and delusion. Look, Ryan, you're gonna be successful in pretty much anything you do because you have the tools to be successful. You understand the patterns. Like you'll be successful. If you text me tomorrow and be like, dude, sold the house, the tree house, starting a lemonade business, direct to consumer and Amazon. I'm like, that's gonna be a successful lemonade business. Go. But that's the same way that LeBron would be successful if he wanted to be a football player. Now he might not be NFL, but he's just a fucking beast athlete. I think there's a lot of people right now that want to be an entrepreneur because it's like a rock status stuff right now, but they can't. And so for me, self-awareness, like I don't want people to just not give up because guess what? There's a lot of people that've been trying to build a business for 11 years and it's never gonna happen, but they could be an amazing number three. They should be you and I number three. So self-awareness, delusion, complaining is my biggest one. Literally 90% of my conversation is predicated on if you're unhappy, the strategy that does not work is going to other people's social media and trolling them because you're unhappy with yourself or going to the bar at 430 and bringing three bug lights and complaining to the bartender. That's not the strategy. Tomorrow, go and do something you've been wanting to do that you're desperately scared about what your parents, the world, the market, your social media followers will think. Do it and then see how not scary all the negativity actually is. You have to understand there's just decisions. There's no right or wrong because you don't, let me tell you why. When you make a decision, you don't know what happened of the other decision. Do one thing that makes you uncomfortable. See the reaction from the audience and your inner family and your friends and realize very quickly that it wasn't as scary as you thought that being back.
