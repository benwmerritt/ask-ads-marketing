## Transcript
The new social media, there's people in this room who've never posted a thing for their company in their life and tomorrow open account post one video and it could work. A lot of you know this, content comes to you now. The algo, the for you, right? That's the era we're in now, that's huge for all of us. Brother, it's fucking free. Everything I've prior done in marketing until 2007 cost money, direct mail, money, billboards, money, radio, money, local TV, money. Hiring sales people to knock on the door and make calls, social media, free. You post free distribution. Yeah, obviously there's some costs associated with time or whatever, but you know this, we don't even have to make big production. People like flip the camera and just fucking talk. Y'all come and fix your fucking roof. Literally, literally make as much content as you humanly can every day. Saying the same shit over and over in different ways. Three years ago, social media changed. It used to be a mass followers, then post, they would see it. Three years ago, TikTok changed the game. Now every platform works this way. Post and the content will find its audience. I believe the AI algorithms are gonna get so good in the next three to five years that when you do post organically, it will, and you're in Denver, it will literally find people that are in market looking to change the roof in fucking Denver. This shit is real. Yeah. How do you do that? Right, like the ideas are important, right? But notice I said a nuance. I hope people are listening. You can say the same thing every day. Literally, you could say the same thing every day. I'm Bob, I've been fixing roofs in this area for the last 20 years. Have a nice day, post, and literally the next day. Hey guys, I'm Bob. I've been doing this for 20 years. I want your roof in, but literally, you could literally say, because not everyone's seeing it, it's just how the shit works. But when you understand that organic social, for example, for the people that raised their hands, if you do organic social and you see what works, you'll start to learn, oh, if this video works, shouldn't I change my Google AdWords to use the words I'm using in this video, and then your AdWords start doing better? It's the starting point. It's the insights that come from it, the comments, how well it does, why did this one do well? Right, and then you start to evolve. Now you're Bob in Denver, and your video, you make a reference to what the nuggets did last night. Like the fucking nuggets lost to the calves and pissed, and all of a sudden, a nuggets fan's like, I like Bob, I'm a nuggets fan too. I'm gonna use him instead of the billboard. I start like, you start to evolve, but it's kind of like working. Has anybody here, I'm one of those people, has anybody here not worked out for a majority of their life and then in their 20s, 30s, or 40s picked it up and it's become a part of their lives, raise your hands? Just curious. So for the seven or eight, 10 people that have done it, what I'm saying now was similar to that, which is the first day's gonna suck. Like right now, 10 or 12 of you, because I've also learned only 10 or 12 of you are gonna do what I'm saying right now, 10 or 12 of you are pumped. You're like, yeah, fuck it, this is what I fucking needed, Gary Vee did it, yeah, I'm gonna do it. And then tomorrow comes and you're like, fuck. Like you start to lose off the high of the moment, but if you stick with it, just like working out, you will be flabbergasted where you are in a year. And so it's posting, it's looking, but the very simple tactic I ask you deeply to say this, make the first video, I gave you one, here's another video I would love for you to make. Hit record at your desk, maybe with your team, maybe by yourself, one minute about you and the business. That should be easy. I'm Paul, I'm Sarah, I've been doing this, I inherited this from my dad, been here for 17 years, we're proud of it. We did the roof on fucking Main Street for the museum that they renovated. Whatever the shit you've got to say, post that. And that video, and again, I'm gonna say run ads on Facebook. I'm very hot on Facebook for this crew. Cause Facebook skews 35, 45, 55, 65, you know, people that actually own homes that need a fucking roof changed. And run ads on Facebook on a 10 to 20, 30 mile radius of your shop. And again, if you're sitting here and being like, well how do I run ads? Good news, I'll give you a website, write it down to do it. It's G-O-O-G-L-E-D dot com. What you do on there is you say, how do I run Facebook ads in a 30 mile radius of my store? Enter, miraculously, for free. It will show you a YouTube video or an article. If you're good at reading, which I am not, you'll read the article. If you're good at audio and visual, you'll watch the video and then you will like watch it and open up your other laptop and you will run the ads. Not somebody else, not your 24 year old niece. Can you do this for me? No, you. So you understand it because what's gonna happen is it's going to work. And when it starts working, you're gonna start pouring more money into it over time cause you like what's happening. And then eventually somebody's gonna do it, not you. And I need you to know it just enough to know if they're doing a good job or not. The amount of money people in this room have lost by hiring someone else who's a kid to do the thing, but they didn't know how to judge if the kid was good at it. You need to know it. Just enough, just like balancing your checkbook. Maybe you're not a CFO or an accountant, but if you have a business and you raise your hand and you own it, you know it enough to not go out of business. If you were starting a roofing company today, what social media platforms would you focus on to get your message out and what would you do? The reason I would successfully come into any person's market and be a problem, not saying put you out of business or even be better than you, but be a problem, is that even if I didn't understand the business as well as you did cause you grew up in the game, A, I'm smart enough to realize that and I would hire people that I'd come and take your number three from you, or your number two. Now I've taken a lot of information quickly. And then what I would do next is your problem. I so would know how to get customers better than you by doing organic social at scale, anything that over indexed with views cause the algorithm now tells you if creative is good. I would then take that ad, even though it might hit, I might be doing business in Iowa, when I put out organic social, I might be hitting somebody in Buffalo, I might be hitting someone in Cincinnati. I know a lot of you have thought about that, which is like, well, how's this valuable? I post it, but I'm in fucking Denver. I don't give a shit if someone sees this in Afghanistan. The problem is what I'm looking for is to see if it resonates with people. Then I take that ad, I tweak it a little bit, I change the copy, and then I run that same video in a five mile radius of my office. If you didn't write that down and record that, I was gonna tell you that was pretty damn good. Right, so that's the new social media game. The social media for the last 15 years, some of you I've seen a bunch of faces here I've known for a long time, that was email marketing. Get as many followers as possible, then a percentage of them would see it. That was hard. The new social media is there's people in this room who've never posted a thing for their company in their life, and tomorrow open account, post one video, and it could work, because now the content, as a matter of fact, I said this the other day, on my social, or maybe I should say a little different, what I'm about to say, I'm actually arguing that social media isn't here anymore. We're now in interest media. A lot of you know this, if you consume social. Content comes to you now. The algo, the for you. That's the era we're in now, that's huge for all of us. But you know this, we don't even have to make big production. People flip the camera and just fucking talk. Y'all come and fix your fucking roof. You know what's funny about what I just said? I think a lot of you are smart enough to realize that. That ad would work on a bunch of people. Certain people, certain people would be like, I'll never do business with that cursing mouth guy. Other people like, you know what, fuck with that shit. Right? So, you know, I think that the social media part is I'm very passionate about, because it's such underpriced behavior. Again, literally flipping your camera around, just saying, hey, I'm Jane. I've been in this business for 21 years locally. I know a lot of you know me, because I'm gonna post this in Facebook, and I know a lot of you know me. I know a lot of you don't. And if you need my HVAC, or roofing, or plumbing, or fucking anything, I don't understand how people are not betting the farm on this, because for me, I know it's gonna go away. I know that social, as we have it today, will not be forever. It's gonna evolve. I'm actually very concerned that, actually I'm very excited, but concerned, I think the metaglasses thing is real. I do predict that in 10 years, we're pretty advanced in our glassware, where the phone gets potentially not fully replaced, but I think a lot of you are gonna be very surprised by how many of you might not have a phone on you in 10 years the way we know the phone, that the glasses, I would actually highly recommend for this holiday season, you buy a pair of the Meadow Ray Bands, just so you feel it. It's like that couple hundred bucks is worth you learning. The thing that you'll learn, you got them? Later, when people see you, stand up for a second so people see you. I want to come up to this young lady and ask her, the craziest part, you probably agree with me, when you first used them was the audio. Right, I was like, oh fuck, I don't think I need ear pods anymore, it's crazy. I don't care my phone, I just click on the side and answer, hang up, all. Yeah, and if you're really, it's really phenomenal, where I'm going with that, if I'm right, and that takes over, you're all gonna cry that you missed this era of free, because Meadow's gonna be like, maybe they don't want it to be free, because they're gonna control it. Right, Apple's not in social, they control a different way and take a rake. So you have seven different platforms. If Meadow wins, and this is the device, they have the optionality to not make a post to be free. Yep, shit's always moving. So anyway, please take a bit, to think that you can't grow your business on social, because you're in roofing, is the dumbest fucking thing you could be possibly thinking. Like, you're selling to human beings. The fuck's the difference if somebody's seeing a video about your business in their Instagram, versus them picking up the phone when you're fucking, or knocking on their fucking door, it's the same shit. Get out of your fucking feelings, this is business. Gary Gray's, he said it on the phone. So, Gary, so why? You know why I said that? Yeah, yeah. A lot of people don't do social on some dumb ideology shit. Oh, it's an afterthought. It's bad for the kids. I don't like it, that's my favorite. Gary, I'm not gonna do I don't like it. I'm like, okay, John. But like, whoa. Like, I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. Like, what does that even mean? You don't like using Instagram so you don't wanna use it to build your business? Like, you like search? Like, I don't get it. You know? And then people go even more, well, Gary, I'm not gonna do TikTok. It's, you know, China. I'm like, okay. It's all excuses. The point I'm trying to make to all of you, everything you're gonna say to me about all this stuff, it's just excuses because you're complacent. Or maybe even scarier, checked out and a little lazy. Like, that's real talk. Like, how are you not putting in effort on this? And that's, listen, it's okay to be the old lion. By the way, I've worked every day since I was 14. I get the concept of, fuck man, cool, Gary. This is all inspiring, but I'm fucking tired. I've been at this for a long time. I don't want to. I'm like, that's fine. But there's a reason that the young lion eventually comes around and kills the old lion and becomes the new king of the jungle. And that's what we're all in. And you just got to understand that. That's a good reason to sell. A good reason to sell is if you've been listening for the last 20 minutes and you're like, fuck you, Gary, I'm not doing this shit. If you're sitting here like, fuck you, Gary, I'm not doing this shit, you should sell tomorrow. Let's be realistic. Home-trubing companies, contractors, aren't typically tech-forward companies. They don't think about technology. They don't embrace technology. What would you say to the crowd right now? Dude, you got about 800 contractors in here right now that literally were saying, I'm not on a CRM, I'm not using technology, I don't like technology. I wish it was 1912 stuff. What would you say to them? That I get you. I was the same way. I grew up a business kid. I liked selling lemonade and sports cards and then wanted to build a big business for my dad's liquor store. And when I was 18 and dreamed about doing that, I thought I was gonna open up first 10 liquor stores in New Jersey and then 10 liquor stores in New York and then Florida. And then I was in a dorm room and I heard, coo-coo-ch, and I saw this internet thing and I'm like, fuck, I'm gonna have to learn this. Like I got an F, F in typing class in my sophomore year of high school because I'm like, I'm never gonna type on a fucking computer. So what do I say? I say, I understand you. But I hope that everybody in this room also understands that you chose to be in business. You didn't choose to be a teacher. You didn't choose to be in politics. You didn't choose to be in something else that doesn't have merit. You're in business and business doesn't give a shit about your feelings or mine. And if you are thinking about bringing a sword to a gunfight, you are going to lose. And so I begrudgingly learned tech. It comes much more natural to me to do what I've done this week. I've actually not been talking a lot publicly this year because I'm busy, but this week ironically, I've been on three stages in Dubai, Miami, and now here. And I love it and it's easy. I rolled that you saw the seconds before you took the stage, I'm working and then they're like, Gary, I'm like, oh fuck, I gotta go and stay, right? And same thing in Dubai, I had 14,000 people in arena and I had no idea what I was gonna talk about, but it comes so natural. And for a lot of you in this business, there are things that come incredibly natural. Maybe you grew up in the game and your hands are on hammer. You grew up in that way. For others like you, the marketing and the leadership came natural. The problem is your ability to get comfortable with the stuff that is uncomfortable, that is required for success, is the indicator to where you're gonna end up. And so what do I say? Tough shit. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. But we could break it down. Tough shit means you could hire someone that's good at it. Right, you gotta know it a little bit though because you might hire someone and you're not sure if they're doing a good job with the CRM or the SEO or the social creative. But like, you know, I get, you know, this is, you know, people love to talk in business, people love to talk about like capitalism and entrepreneurship and USA and all this stuff. And then they cry about merit. Like, technology's here and if you're gonna let other companies use it, you're gonna lose market share. And you're, by the way, you're allowed to lose market share. You're allowed to have a business that's more vulnerable and softer and not in a position to sell. You're allowed, but to put your head in a sand and technology is always a bad move. Technology's undefeated. And the quicker you understand that truth, you could cry about AI or you can put in the work for 30 hours and read and learn and realize how you're gonna weaponize it for you. You could cry about social media or you could take the 20 hours, put in the work and learn how to use it for you. And so, you know, tech is oxygen. And Gary, when you talk about technology, you're one of the few people in the public sphere who has been super early on the major tech trends that have happened over the last 15, 20 years and has been right for the most part, which is really hard with new tech trends, especially how early you are. I mean, I still see your videos, like talking about the iPhone back in like 2008, 2010, talking about like how the iPhone's gonna take over, you know, Blackberry, which was a wild thing to say on the back. I know a lot of you didn't wanna give up your Blackberry. Yeah, people are like, I remember the argument, I was like, this has the internet. And the argument was like, put the buttons on the Blackberry. I was like, all right. And you talked about that. You've been early on social media, on Facebook and Instagram. You've been early on TikTok, famously so. On crypto, you've been early. And so you kind of have a good eye to see, and you're involved in a lot of tech companies yourself, the big problem that I see in roofing contractors is that you have a lot of owners, entrepreneurs themselves, who are able to see the trend. And they're able to see like, hey, AI is the future. I need to get on social media. I need to do content. I need to do these things. But they have a really hard time getting their teams to buy in and getting the change management adopted in their company. So one thing is like having a new technology and then actually having it adopted in your companies. And one of the things that you talk about a lot is people. You don't talk a lot that much about technology. You talk about people and how to manage people and how to get people to embrace new things. How do you do that? How do you get your people to embrace these new things that seem radical to most people? I do it by having a lot of conversations. I normally start with the leadership team. I've had a career where my businesses have started at one or two or three people and then have become thousands. And so without knowing how many employees you have, I've lived every version of it. And it's the same game, whether you have six employees. In that scenario, the way to get this across is really making sure your right hand or woman is on board with you. If there's a disconnect between you, the leader, and your number one on whatever the issue is, you're already vulnerable. So whether that's, at this point though, for example, at VaynerMedia, we're now 2,500 people globally. And I just use a lot of Zoom meetings with everybody. And it's straight, just, for me, I get very excited and I'm very passionate about the things I believe in. And so it's just communicating very aggressively. It's hard to get everyone on board, especially. It was much easier when, how many people here have less than 50 employees? Raise your hand, I'm gonna assume. Quite a, don't be shy, real high, I wanna get a sense. It's a blessing when it's that little. You can get it there. When you've got five, 10, 15 employees or less, how do you get them there? By giving them no choice. The thing that I wanna, I think a lot about, what can be valuable? Like why am I here? And what's the one thing I can say? And I know it'll be one thing for one person, it'll be another thing, we'll get three people. But I promise you, how many people here are owner-operators? You're the owner, raise your hands. For the people that just raised your hands, 100% of everything that's not going well is 100% your fault. Is that what you're going to do? 100%, I know it hurts, but it's true. If Patty is fucking up, fire her. I love when people are like, oh, it's all fucked up. I'm like, because you suck. Like you're in control. Like, you know what I think, but what's interesting is for me, and especially as you go to scale, there's like 900 things that are fucked up right this minute. And that doesn't cripple me, it actually gets me excited because I feel like I can fix it. That's accountability. If I can leave with anything, if I can get everyone here into full accountability, how many people here are not the boss? Raise your hand, not the boss, it's not your company, raise it. I have good news for you too. If you're like, my boss blows, quit. Right? Accountability is the gateway drug to happiness. So, how do you get people on board? You fucking first motivate them. First you're empathetic, first your trying different maneuvers and then there's a moment where you give them no choice. And I don't care if Don's been in the company for 17 years, If Don is the reason we're not implementing something that is imperative to make the business go forward, then Don is gonna have to have a very tough conversation from you that's like, hey Don, this is it. If you keep fucking up what I'm trying to achieve by undermining it, because you're the OG in the building, you're gonna be out. I'm gonna help, and by the way, if you're a nice person, like I'm a nice guy, in no scenarios, I'm like God, I'll help you get another job. But we're not, this ship is not sinking because you don't like AI. I don't even understand how any human could think technology doesn't make, like I don't know what the fuck we're talking about here. Is there anyone here that thinks like a pencil and paper are better than technology? Like what the fuck is this argument? What are we doing, seriously? The truth we are using, pencil and paper still are right up orders, be honest, be honest. It's okay. It's okay. Tell the other one, what person out there my man, there you go. Thank you, thank you. By the way, by the way, like implementing tech is hard. I mean, I had to fight my fucking dad for like three years to upgrade our register. I'm being dead serious. I'm like, dad, we need like this fucking register blows. Like it's like the techs from 1984. He's like, I'm comfortable with it. I promise, like, for every time something new pops, wouldn't TikTok, right? Cause I know a lot of you saw me back then cause I had a big enough audience and I was yelling about it in 17 and 18. And so a lot of people talk to me about it now because it's become so big. If you think I was pumped, I was sad. Every time there's a new technology, I'm like fuck again. Like, you know, like, cause for me it's like, like I'm winning at whatever is currently happening. I built on direct mail. People like Gary Vee built his dad's business social media. I'm like, look at the timing, there was no social media. I built my dad's business on direct mail and print. And then email and then Google AdWords. By the time the social media thing happened, yes, I'm aware that that's when people discovered me. So that's the starting point. I've been doing all sorts of different shit that's OG for a decade at that point. You know, I wish we were still in just direct mail. I had that shit fully figured out. I'm being serious. Like I don't get pumped. I mean, there's a, at this point, I realize I'm good at it. So now I'd be lying to you if I didn't say, okay, well this spits me. So, and by the way, when you move first in your competitive set, you get most. First move for advantage is real shit. But I'm starting to rub like the concept of like sitting up here and doing this banter on like tech, no shit. And this is a thing about the roofing space, you know, these people are great people here. And I'm not a technology, I'm more of a technology guy than a speaker. I told you I'm bad. I'm like, this isn't my thing. You love it, right? I said this is not my thing, but I'm more technology, right? Like the business and technology side. And I think you said that. But I'm starting to interrupt, but I think we're over-coddling. I'd rather them just go out of business. I'm being serious. Like, no, but I mean it. Like in a world of like wanting to help someone, it's like parenting, right? Parenting got fucked up. We're over-coddling these little fuckers. Now, now, now pay attention to the hypocrisy. The clapping that just happened when we were making fun of our kids, hi. But us sitting up here making fun of you for not doing tech, you're quiet as fuck. You're all fired. That. Like again, I don't think this is, I don't know we're gonna motivate, for example, because I don't have the full context. Anyone here who's way behind on whether it's marketing, on social and things of that nature, or tech by bringing in SaaS or CRM, I don't think at this point, the three of us in the next 42 minutes and 24 seconds are gonna motivate them to jump. I think we have to tell them the truth, which is you're vulnerable. And you don't think so because you've been, you've been big in the area for the last 15 years. People say that shit all the time in every sector. And then something happens. And that something is always tech enabled competitors or companies come and take your shit. And so like, what are we doing here? Like please do not be, like do not make ideological choices when it comes to business. Do not make selfish choices of what you like or don't like. Focus on the business, the consumer, like that. So Gary, one of the things that you've been really great at and you talk about it right now is finding arbitrage. Like what's the new channel? What's the new technology that's gonna find the arbitrage so that I can actually get the next wave of growth and everybody else is gonna stay behind. And one of the biggest arbitrage that I've seen in business is brand, the power brand. It's the biggest. That's it. Yeah, so and the biggest- Because brand, I'm sorry. Brand means customers are gonna come to you. You know, like I love sales. I'm a salesman. But sales is what you do when you're not good at brand. We don't even answer RFPs anymore at Vayner, which is like the only way you can get business in agency land. We just don't do it. We're like, we built brand. You wanna work with me and us? Then give us your business. I'm not fucking making a deck. So brand is the ultimate arbitrage. What do you think religion is? What do you think Nike is? What do you think Nike's knocking on your door and be like, hey man, you want some sneakers? Brand is, there is nothing else. There's nothing else. And I wanna focus in on one thing that happens with brand, which is it allows you to have pricing power. Yes. You talk about Nike, you know, as a Steve Jobs video, he talks about Nike's like a commodity product, but you know, Nike prices out everybody else. Apple with the iPhone, they get 80% of the profits in smartphones. It's why I want everybody here to build personal brand. Because when they call you and they wanna work with you in roofing because they've seen you in the video and they're like, but you know, but and you give them the price and they're like, but the other guy down the street's a little less. You're like, cool, work with the other guy, but they don't want to. They called you. When they call you, you have pricing power. When you ask them, you don't. Do you guys see that? Yes. You're here to be said. Woo! It's real. It's real. I've never questioned a lot. Can I say one other thing? Cause I'll forget it. And this is just how my brain works. The number one video everybody here can make is called titled, how to not hire us to fix your roof. I want everybody to write this down. If you're trying to, like, I know, I know that some people, I know a handful of people here are gonna be actually motivated to like attack social a little bit, but then the next problem happens, which is like, what the fuck do I say? Like what is the, right? That shit. Let me give you the first ad you should all make in your local area. The title of the video should be how to not hire us to fix your roof. And the video is a video you make that tells people common things that people make mistakes on to not fix a little thing that can become a big thing. You are now building trust and reputation. Right? Like think about how that works. If you're out here making a video for your local area of like, hey, I don't want to come and charge you a big nut to replace your whole roof. Let me tell you a couple of things you could be doing to maintenance your roof better so you can call me four years down the line, not four months from now. Now you're starting to build community. Now you're starting to build trust. Now you're starting to, it's not just transactional. It's a very big deal. Literally what you just said right quick, one of our customers, he sells windows in Texas. If you guys Google his YouTube channel, Window Experts in Houston, Houston Window Experts, he literally did that. He literally did a video just like that. He'd be like, hey, common mistakes of buying windows. And he built a brand online, a YouTube channel. His salespeople each on average, on average. He has a team of like five salespeople. They each on average make like $4 million a year in interrupt each for the business. And all of it inbound. He's not struggling with leads going down. He's not struggling with like, you know, SEO. And like he literally, you go to his YouTube channel. SEO is paying tax. Yeah. Like you're a toll booth in SEO. Google's taking your money for your own leads sometimes. SEO is transactional. It's not marketing, it's sales. No shit, it works. Somebody typed in how to fucking fix my roof, enter. Yes, that's sales. Like you don't wanna be in that game. Because SEO is about to change over the next 10 years. SEO's intro. How many people here, this section, I'm glad we got to this. How many people here, I'm one of them, so I'm gonna raise my hand. How many people here do well with SEO? It's a part of their mix. It's something they, raise your hands. Hi, I wanna see it. Hi, please. Everybody, including me, who just raised your hands. We need to understand that AI is about to eat the shit out of SEO. Chat, GPT, Plexity, and then like Alexa at home. And the problem is, SEO was good for us. Need to fix my roof, enter. Lots of results. Hey, Chat, GPT, I need to fix my roof. They're gonna tell you who to use. There's no 50 results. There's no right side of the rail. They're gonna tell you who to use and they're gonna take a percentage of that. My friends, things are moving. How many people here are retiring in the next five years? And I don't mean you're gonna crush it for the next couple years and sell the company and buy a boat. I mean, you're old and you're finished. Raise your hands. One, two, two. Right? So those two gentlemen that I just saw, you can take some of this with some percentage of a grain of salt, right? You're like, you're holding on to like, you're playing prevent defense, right? Like holding on to just not lose. You like that football reference? For the rest of you, please pay attention. If you plan on being business in six years from today, there's a lot of shit we need to like look at. I appreciate that. We're gonna open it up. There's a microphone right there. And right then I'm gonna ask Matt Freedman to bring out Buddy and Jason once too. I'm gonna ask everybody to ask one question. Yo, what the fuck is going on on this side? There's like tons of people lining up here. There's nobody who's lined up here. I'm gonna ask you one question. Just so there's a lot of people that are about 21 minutes, 22 minutes. I don't wanna look at Gary, I don't wanna look at Sebastian. By the way, the need for you to first, I'm surprised it's so hard. Very much, if you can grant, right now to help VDA guys to help build trust so that we can grant them the future. You know, it's funny you say that. My brother called me yesterday to set up a meeting for me with a company next week that is doing early AI SEO. So the answer is I don't know, brother, but I've been looking for it. And I'm actually ironically on the pre-dawn of starting my process of probably knowing. But what I will say is, I have so many friends screen shooting me like different AI queries. Like who are the best entrepreneurs in the world? And my name is showing up and I laugh because I really don't think I am actually one of the best entrepreneurs in the world. But I know that I've produced a lot more content than every other entrepreneur and that's why the AI is picking that up. And then it becomes brand. And then wait a minute, does that actually put me in a position? You know, so I would say that tactically, the SEO of AI hasn't been cracked yet, which is why I'm trying to figure it out. But macro, if everything stays in your head, a young woman, I don't know if she's here or she said she wanted to start something, there you are, you knew where I was about to go. I'm impressed. She said, hey, I'm really passionate about this bucket list thing that I wanna do. And I was like, then you have to do. I said it can't be in your head. Action. And so I promise you pondering and just sitting on the sidelines on technology isn't gonna do it. I think one of the best things that can do to help you show up in the AI is starting to make content and starting to put you and your brand out there. Thank you. You're welcome. Now I just wanna say this is my word. Good morning, here. Morning, brother. I'm the director of marketing technology and I'm a boarder about a month ago. I noticed a workflow issue within our organization. We're currently a homeowner called into our company. We take all their information, pass that information along to the sales person. My question for you is, who would be a, who would be a live transfer or who would be just pushing it on the ground? Look, I think live transfers are epic because you're still on the hook. It's emotionally better. Like you have a better chance of closing if you're still in that motion in that moment. So I'm a big believer that live transfer is a better arbitrage and has historically shown much better results. And now it becomes a journey. If you don't have that infrastructure, you start investing it step by step. But for me, like if you can, close when they're fucking ready to close. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. All right, thank you. So thanks for your time. Thank you. Hey Gary, this is from the back of your football top. So if you were up on stage already talking about how you learn from the direct meal and the barging meal and then you learn content creation, so from media, you're someone that has been able to adapt to it. The changes in the technology. I'm someone that I grew up in this industry as a laborer. I'm just trying to make it correct and I'm making money from this. I was really awaking by like, when you work for business, it's completely different from my actual business. Very. So my question to you is, how do people learn and adapt to the project of learning new things, and what are some practical needs that you can learn from these facts? Man, this is such a powerful question, brother. First of all, you just asked the question of why my content evolved from 2006 through to 2024. I used to tell all of you what to do and then nobody was doing it. And I was like, fuck, man, I'm telling you, like do Google AdWords, here's Facebook. And I was like, why? And then I started reading the comments. I was like, fuck, people are insecure. The first way to be adaptable is to not be scared to fail. The way to not be scared to fail is to not value other people's opinions. Right? So I think this fear of failing is stopping people from adaptability because for some reason, players, which you all are on the field, have decided to value the crowds, boos, and cheers. So I think the number one unlock to adaptability is the ability to not give a shit about what people think about you. Oh. Okay. That's one. Once you get over that hurdle, which is, I say that, some people never get over that hurdle. Unfortunately, just not knowing everybody here, but I just know how it works, 90% of people here are still mentally stuck in high school. They literally do care what people think. Once you get over that hurdle, it becomes practice. How the fuck did you get good as a laborer? You weren't, you were better the thousandth time you did a fucking shingle than the first. Practice. But again, if you're not scared, like the failure thing fucks everyone up. The ego thing, I'm good at email. I spent seven years doing email. Oh, this new thing, fuck that. I wasted my time on email. No, you didn't. You dominated email when it mattered. And unfortunately, it's now shifted. So it's all perspective and mentality and then practice. You're welcome. Thank you. We heard so much of this yesterday from the presenters. Raise your hand if you've never failed at anything before. You all know how failure feels like. You're here because you want to get better and learn from the failure and apply it to better yourself, right? Brother, can I build on that? Yes, sir. Even a step further. I prefer failing. Yes. Let me say this nice and slow. I get, why do you think I'm still a fucking Jets fan? I'm being serious. I grew up a huge Yankees fan. Huge. But then they won in 96 and it stopped being interesting. This is why I'm so into the Jets. I fucking love, you guys are like, oh, sorry, Gary, you guys suck, Aaron Rodgers. I'm like, fuck you, I love it. Do you know how bad I feel for 35 and under Boston sports fans? They've won everything already. It's over, it's boring. The Red Sox were super fucking epic. Now they're just whatever. Like losing is the fucking game. Micro losing. Right, going completely out of business is bad. But I promise you, you can't really see it because of the way I communicate. But if you ask me, if we hang out in heaven in 300 years and be like, yo, I saw you in fucking Marko Island and you're like, yo, cool, what's up? And we're chilling in heaven and you're like, yo, but really, why did that work for you? Like why did you have a good life and why were you successful? Humility. Again, not obvious, you don't know me like that. But my inner circle knows it's not the bravado you see here. It's the humility. I like the losing. I don't think I'm special. I just think I'm gonna persevere. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll say another question, best name in the comments. Mr. Joe Moose. What's up, Eric? Good to see you brother. Hey, we feel so organic, social media only. I know. Not even paid ads. I know. It's on a lot of what I learned from you. I saw it bro. And by the way, that's why I do it. I saw it. There's no greater gift. It's funny because this just happened. This is why I'm going. What do you mean December? Three months ago, we landed a humongous $25 million fee deal. Like we got it. Yeah, Gary, we won it. We got it. Three hours later, I was flying and reading email and I got like four emails in a row like yours brother. Hey Gary, I own a flower shop. I read day trading attention. Like we were in deep shit. We were gonna get evicted. Like done one fucking TikTok tripled our business. Next one. Hey man, built like the next one. Hey, I'm gonna count in. I heard you on LinkedIn. I've been pounding it. My business is double. And I just, it was so insane to me how those four random emails felt seven trillion times more interesting to me than the big deal we made. I promise you, some of you are empaths. Some of you were built this way. You get a high from like feeling good. Like when you're like that right there. Like I know that at least one person was sitting here today is gonna do something different because of this talk. I know at least one. I wasn't joking earlier. It's probably only gonna be 10. But it's the fucking best. I'm proud of you bro. It's because it's fucking free. So my question based on social media content, the issue I'm having is I'm in solar and my wife was in the roofing. You get to a plateau where the audience is not interested in roofing or solar. How do you build your audience to still have that riches and the niches? You're not even close to penetrating it. That. You might not be mixing up your content enough. You might not be using enough platforms. You might not be posting enough on each platform until you're posting on all seven. YouTube shorts, Snapchat spotlight, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok. Until you're posting on all seven and you're posting three original pieces of content a day on all seven and you do that for 15 years like I have and you still don't have 50% of the market knowing who the fuck you are, you can't say what you just said. Got me? Got it? That. You haven't even started penetrating. Once you understand that, you're off to the races. Let's go to Ian. What do you got? So I'm 21 years old, I'm a professional in the industry for a solar man, something called Detaptor Test or Beauty and Sales. My question is, I wanna set myself up with the future, build a financial stability, but at the same time enjoy my youth now. How do I balance the work hard and enjoy it at the same time? What's the balance? By realizing you're 21. Bro, first of all, I already know even the way you're asking the question and the way I feel, you're gonna be fine. I'm not even bullshitting you, you're gonna be fine. The fact that you're even thinking about it and the way you articulated it, you're gonna be fine. You want a really good piece of advice? You're fucking 21, you could do both. You can work 12 hours a day. There's 53 year old sitting here that are like, man, this motherfucker, you could work. I'll tell you why. That's what they, right? That's how I see them. And I'm gonna tell you why. They grew up in the generation where they literally worked from fucking 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Went home, took a shit in the shower, went out, drank for four fucking hours and had fun, came home, woke up and did it again for seven straight fucking years. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You know, yeah, by the way, to your point, I'm not saying I'm promoting it. The answer to your question was the way I answered it. By you realizing you're 21, when I tell you, and I'm not bullshitting you, you may think I'm doing this for hyperbole, I'm telling you the truth, what I'm about to say. Besides the family dynamics, the kids and all that professionally, I would give up absolutely everything I have right now to trade with you. And that's why I did it. That's why the question was, I know it's time to live in the most expensive commodity, and so it's how do I? You have 100 years to live more. You're gonna be a hundred, oh, you know how pissed I am at you? You're in the generation that's gonna live for 100, you're gonna be 121 years old when you die. Well, so good, bro, like I don't know, like fucking enjoy it and work. I don't know, it's so easy. I'll tell you what's happening, and you'll appreciate it. We're now in the thinking generation, we're over analyzing. If you didn't think about it, you would accomplish it easy. Work, and have fun. Like, it all comes down to not beating yourself up. If you go hard for the next seven months, as you're building your fucking future. I mean, 15 hours a day, no hanging out with friends. Work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep. And then you wake up after seven months, you're like, fuck this bullshit, and go to fucking Ibiza for two weeks and not work. It's all gonna be fine. There is no fucking, don't listen to anybody. Nobody's, there is no right way. And there's so much serendipity. Who you fall in love with, what happens, how the macro market, micro, bro, you can't control this shit. All you can do is realize you have unlimited time. You could literally do everything wrong. You could literally fuck around for the next 10 years and do nothing financially smart or work. Wake up, literally do nothing good, except have fun for 10 straight years. Wake up and be so fucking young at 31 that you could then focus on having a good financial. Yep. I hate to do this, I'm a bad guy. I hate to do this. And bro, I was the reverse. I gave up my entire 20s. I was obsessed to build a business for my parents. I don't know why, I really, like it's a little bit, I think I went too far. But from 21 to 28, I worked 100 fucking hours a week. I went out zero days. I built something for my family. And then I woke up at 28 and I was like, okay, wait a minute, maybe I should start thinking. And then at 34, I was like, had no money but built a huge business for my dad. I was like, fuck, I'm 34, maybe I should start worrying about myself. And had plenty of time to do what I'm doing. You have unlimited fucking time. You got you. I was like, I'm too much of a business. I'm too much of a business. Most interesting man in the comments by the way. I'm a little off the top for taking this step. But I'm gonna go to the studio and let them do the review. But Gary, thank you for your time. It's been all right hopes and no debts. So, I love it. You've kind of answered my question before, but I stopped using Google search. I'm just on complexity now. Yep. It's amazing. And I'm working on there, thankfully. I love it. Just one, if you can touch on a little bit more about ranking on there. Like I know you don't have information on it. Or do you see any convictions in that space? It's gonna eat up everything. It's better. How many people here use chat, chat, GPD per flex, they use it. Raise your hand. Raise it high. Actually stand up. This is important. This is an important moment. Stand up if you use it. Yeah, stand up if you use it. I just want everybody to look around. This crew is not like Silicon Valley Elite. You see where I'm going, right? This crew is OG. That's all we've been talking about. I need everybody who's not standing to look around. I want you to look around. 70% of this room is now begun the process of shifting away from going to Google to using AI chat bots. This shit's over. It's not fully over, but this is only going in one direction. And if you are overly reliant on Google for your business, you better fucking wake up. Cool. Woo! I apologize everyone else. So my name is David. I'm the D-CAD recess holder as well. My brain kind of like weird. I have to write down my question and I'll wrap it up. What are your most important lessons you've learned from your failures and how can I apply those lessons to implement into my journey and my journey with entrepreneurship and in career? That nobody gives a fuck about your failures. Come on. Woo! Yeah! You want me to break that down for you? All right. What I've learned about my failures is, do you remember having a zit in high school? And remember in the morning you're like, fuck. Like all bent out of shape and you think fuck. Like you're just like you're fucked up. And then you go to high school and what you didn't realize is everybody else has fucking zits too. And they're worried about their fucking zits, not yours. And if they're really insecure, they'll make fun of your zip because deep down they're really fucked up about their zip. So what do I think brother? The second you realize that your failures are yours, your battle scars, they're yours. You start liking them versus fearing them. But 99% of this room is still fearing them. Which is why I pound the fuck out of the content that I pound. So what have I learned? That that doesn't mean anything except to yourself. And if you learn to like them versus fear them of how that makes you look in front of others, you will be a fucking dominant player. Yeah! That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. All right, that is the last one. If you ever go sit down in that room, please don't be like that. You gotta get a camera know about someone. Please, I'm sorry. I don't know. It's by the way, by the way, it was all their fault. The mics were there the whole time. You could have gotten up early. I love that they fucking didn't get their session. It's merit. I'm serious. I love merit, my man. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to ask you this question. Right now. You got 45 seconds. He said it was 12, 20 years old, so fresh right into the company. Yep. I'm gonna do the big thoughts with her now. My whole life, I've had this idea, my parents and school, my teachers, that if I don't go to college, I'm not gonna be suspected. They're fucking stupid. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! I'm gonna be great, I'll eat a lot of stuff now. I'm so good. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! That's so good. Ha ha ha! Bro, you're gonna win. And then you're gonna look at them and tell them that you told them so. And if not, and you fucking suck in life, then they'll make fun of you and say if you would've went to college, you wouldn't have sucked. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Bro, I apologize. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Bro. I'm gonna say something that's gonna help a lot of people here. Do you love your parents? Yes, I do. Like a lot, like you're in a good place with them? Of course. Well, not everybody is. Some of us aren't, like I got lucky. It sounds like you got lucky. Some of us, you know, our parents were in a bad place and they couldn't deliver for us in the right way. But what a lot of kids in your spot do is what your dilemma is right now. And this is why I said, give me a minute. I'm okay, I'll run to the airport and make sure I make it. A lot of kids end up doing what their parents want them to do, because they love them. They're like, they put a roof on them, they took care of me, they bought me all the shit I wanted. And so you're doing it for them. What they don't realize is, when you live your life for your parents, you start to build resentment towards your parents. And so what they choose is, instead of right now, in the short term, your parents being disappointed and it being like a little bit of a thing, there's a lot of people later in their life that have no relationship with their parents because they blame their parents for everything that happened in their life because they follow their, I mean, there's people that marry people based on their parents. Definitely go to college. And so why I'm taking a moment is, it might hurt a little right now and they may be disappointed. But I promise you, you're actually putting yourself in a position to have a better relationship with your parents, not the other way around. And that's what well-intended kids don't see at this age. Makes sense? Here, you are a very busy man. Yes. In the last 10 years, do you have any regrets, personal or business, being working through my sheen? Are any regrets? No. Woo! Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Because I think regret is an interesting, I try to, first of all, because you've been watching me, you know how much I talk about regret. So because I'm scared shitless of having regret, I think I live my life that way, so that's been helpful. I've had unlimited setbacks professionally and personally. Challenges, tough moments. I'm also in a place where I have my life very simple. I'm busy and I'm chaotic and I'm high energy and I'm who I am. But I grew up, you know, similar to you in a Soviet, kind of Eastern European immigrant family where both my great-grandmother and my grandma would never have one drink or a cup of tea where they wouldn't say something to the tune that would translate to good health, right? That's the derivative, right? Like to me, my whole life was, it doesn't matter how much money you make, fame, this and that, like every day, including this morning, I woke up, I looked at my phone, there was no 57 missed calls, means nothing horrible happened overnight. And I'm just grateful to be able to play. I'm not, I'm very much detached from the Gary Vee of it all, I'm not detached from the money of it all. I just want to do what I'm doing. There's plenty of, I would call them micro regrets, right? But I did my best to spend, you know, I'm 15 and 12 year old, I spent as much time as I could, way more than my dad did. You always want more time with the people you love, right? But I also have been the emotional and financial foundation for my entire family. And that comes, you know, you can't do that if you're not putting in the time and the work. And so, I don't know if, look, I anticipate to have regrets. I'm still a young man at 49, I've got another 50 years to live. So I'm sure it's gonna be there, but as I sit here with you today, no. And that's because all the dumb shit we just talked about for 30 minutes, which I love, is dumb shit. You know, what you need to focus on is like, real love and health and just simple, like basic shit. And when you live in that world, you've won. Yeah.
