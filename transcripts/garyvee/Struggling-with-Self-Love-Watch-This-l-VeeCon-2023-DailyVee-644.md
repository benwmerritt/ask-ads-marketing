It's just such a pleasure to be with all of you. I just want to thank you for being here so early. Who worked out already this morning? Just curious. I'm impressed. I'll be impressed. I wasn't there, I'll be impressed though. But we have an incredible day in the stadium. I'm here to sign a whole bunch of stuff. Good! We're coming back. One second. We're back. We're back. That's what I was looking for. I know baby, but I can't wait to see you next year. I can't wait. I'm counting down the days of seeing you next year. So I started following your advice. I've been following your advice for a long time. My business has grown up and it has never been the same since. So I just want to say thank you so much. Thank you. I need examples like you for them because they don't fucking tell them. They don't listen. So I started following Gary's advice. My business grew up on TikTok about six months ago and my life has been forever changing. We just sold out of our third shipment again. I'll see you there. Is there stairs? Can I jump? We are handing out mimosas. I want to make sure everyone gets one. Hey, everybody. We are handing out mimosas. I want to make sure everyone gets one. Hey, everybody. I'm Gary Vaynerchuk, creator of VFriends. I just wanted to take five seconds before day two officially kicks off. I know I got to meet a bunch of you already this morning. But I just want to say thank you. Thank you for supporting this. Thank you for being a part of it. If you find yourself being an introvert and you want to try and practice getting to be out there and put yourself out there, there is no safer place than this weekend to start that process for you. So keep that in mind. I love you all. Thank you for being here. Enjoy. Personally, a big fan. Thank you. Born and raised here in Indy. Hey, thank you very much for being here. As a token of our appreciation, I'll give a little backstory. Just as this is your second conference and you're getting things rolling, the Jets were actually the first game here in Indianapolis. As the way that the Jets helped us get on the map from a football standpoint, we are happy to help you get on the map from a convention standpoint. Oh, my God. I love it. I love it. The first game here in Indianapolis. You want to hear something crazy? I remember this game vividly because the move was such a big deal and I just started being into football and I was nine and I was like, wait, teams can move towns? It was like a big to do. And I remember this game so vividly because it was the first game of the season that year. I was super nervous. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. This is unbelievable. If you know me, something like this is like 87 times more exciting than something small for me and McNeil. I remember. Thank you. This is very nice. Pleasure. I really cherish this. This is really nice. I got to get a quick look at all this. First, I just want to thank everybody for being here. I'm so excited about 2023. How did we feel about last night? Yes, Hal 평i.END OF TENTām One thing that I've noticed from a lot of you is that you reach out to me around family business dynamics. A very big theme. A lot of you are pondering it. And what I really know is this audience is grooming a lot of their own business partners who happen to be their children right now as entrepreneurship and side hustles and family business dynamics are growing in society. So knowing so many of you are on this journey right now and knowing so many of you will be on this journey in the future, I thought there was no better way than to kick off V-Con, than to have Sasha and A.J. Vaynerchuk join me up here. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Sit, sit, sit. I love you. Strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends. Friends become family. I have a very strong feeling that many of the faces that I can see right now in the crowd that I flat out already know and know a lot about you are destined to become family with each other and with this community and with myself. And so I thought it was incredibly important to start V-Con 2023 with family. I thank you for sitting through our stories. I just want you to please, please be friends with each other. That is the biggest ROI of this project. I thank Sasha, my dad, A.J., my brother, and I thank all of you most for being here at V-Con. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Brother. Made it again. Snuck in. Yeah. I like it. Let's go. Keep doing it. It's packed in here. How are you? Good, how are you? Good to see you. I'm 24. Okay. And I really, really, really struggle with self-love. So that comes from parenting or environment? Parents, definitely. Yep. That's okay. That's therapy. That's surrounding yourself with positivity. You're in control of getting yourself out. There's like, that's not like bad. By the way, that's normal. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. That's normal. Right. That's what everyone's dealing with. Yeah. So don't be dwelling on that. Be happy that you know it. The only difference between you and most people is you figured it out already. Most people haven't even started the journey of understanding they don't love themselves. You're way ahead. Oh, thanks. Yeah. Most people who are like, wait a minute. I don't have self-love. I don't have confidence. They think they're behind. They're ahead. Nobody, there's such a small amount of people that are as lucky as I was, which is why I speak with caution when I talk about this. I got lucky with parents and with circumstances that I had self-love. But like, most people don't. Yeah. And even I've had to work through my insecurities. Yeah. Do you understand how lucky you are that you know? Yeah. Do you? Yeah. Well, now I do. Definitely. Ready. You're ahead. Thanks so much. Not behind. Thank you. Therapy, if you can afford it. Or just get positivity in your fucking ears. That's what I need more. More of that. Adjusting it more. And do not surround your, you have to cut out your friends. You have to limit the time you interact with the negative people in your life. Yeah. That's my problem. Like if one of your parents or both your parents are negative, you got to speak to them once a week, not three times a day. Right. If you're three best friends, if one of them is negative, you got to start to cut that down. You have to cut down negativity and you have to pump in positivity. That's the only way. That's the work. Here's the only perfect card right now. Fuck. It's fucking fire. All right. I'll take a Gary B. I love it. Good choice. I'll take the astronaut. Okay. And the panda. Panda. This is it. And the normal. This is normal. Yep. Beautiful. All right. Bring me up. I can't wait to do it. Thank you so much. Of course. Welcome to the beacon. Viper stage. Kite. Koolie. Gary. Vaynerchuk. Love you. Love you. Love you. Love you. Love you. Hi, guys. I'm Heidi. And I'm the chief marketing officer for, yes it is. It's good to see you. You guys give us a little taste of what might be coming. Heidi, you want me to jump on this one? So obviously pop culture, what's actually happening in the now matters quite a bit. I'm sure that anybody here that pays attention to the Crocs universe understands that the gibbets culture is a big deal. And that many of you have nieces, nephews, friends and yourself collecting gibbets. So clearly we are on stage. I have no idea, you know, if you can see this, but we've got some Crocs on that have some gibbets on them that if it zooms in nicely, you can tell those are V-friends gibbets. So I'm excited about this quite a bit. You know, when I think about extending the IP and creating storytelling, this was kind of a North Star collaboration for me. And so this is a little bit of a preview. I think we've got some more things brewing. And so I think it should be a good fall or winter or whatever our timing gets down. But we definitely have some stuff brewing. Can I like throw this in the crowd? It's not like we don't. Yeah, we're fine. So I think, I think I'm going to throw all six pairs of the first pairs with gibbets on it in the crowd. So I'm going to do that. Here we go. I will see all of you this evening. I expect all six of you who caught that to flip it on eBay tonight. I will be bidding. I love you V-friends. I hope you're enjoying. Thank you. I just want to thank Harry and Izzy for hosting us. I want to thank Videoamp for being an incredible partner for us. Thank you, everyone. For me, what V-friends is, is my opportunity for the next 50 years to get those characters to do my work for me. That's why this matters so much for me. If I can get the world to fall in love with accountable and like I can tell you right now every person here would be twice as happy if they went fully accountable. If everything that's bothering you right now in a personal relationship or professionally you decide it was actually your fault and nobody else's, your life would be 10 times better. Hey! Got Mr. Vaynerchuk in here. We told you this dinner was going to be twice as happy. That's Mr. Vaynerchuk. I love you. I love you. I thought it was one cup of tea. Second annual V-con 2023. The first year was good. So far this blows without a word. And do you know why? Can't wait for year three. Do you know why V-con 24 is going to be the best? Because when we all get together for a private fly fish event everybody would have already experienced fly fish which I'm really looking forward to. Because speaking about working. Happy holidays. We should probably go on tour. Yeah, we should do it. Let's see how today goes. We may never talk again. Very awesome. Shout to V-con. Shout to Gary. It is amazing what he has built. It really is amazing what he's built. Welcome back to the V-con by Mr. Vaynerchuk. Gary Vaynerchuk. And if I would lie. Oh, there we go. I heard that crack. Putting other people's opinions of yourself in front of yours. Then they go to me. But Gary, what if it's my opinion of myself that I suck? And I remind them that that was instilled in you.
