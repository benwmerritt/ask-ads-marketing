## Transcript
That was the day the firm was mine. Wow. OK? And then I went and hired everybody we loved. My brother joins. My best friend joins. My college roommate's brother went to Harvard Business School. He runs banking. Everybody. I hire everybody I love, but I make that the rule not for me. Of course. For everybody. So that's the firm that's located on the 101st to the 105th floor of the World Trade Center. My parents died when I was young. My mom, when I was 16, dad at 18. So that sort of starts the process. You lose one parent. It's one thing. You lose the second parent. It's a whole other thing. Family pulled out. You think, OK, all the uncles and aunts are going to come jump into your rescue? No, no, no. They were afraid we'd be sticky. You know, they'd invite us over and we'd never leave. So at my dad's funeral, my dad gets killed September. So my mom dies of cancer, breast cancer. Dad has cancer. He goes in for his first chemotherapy shot. We had no money. So we went to a local hospital. The nurse makes a terrible mistake, gives him someone else's dose, and kills him on the table. Jesus. September 12, 1979. So at my dad's funeral, September 15, my dad's brother says, hey, you want to come over for Thanksgiving? I'm like, isn't that like November? Why aren't you worried about how I'm going to eat, say, tomorrow night? He was like, just let me know if you want to come over. Never spoke to the idea. Got in care. My sister's 20. I'm 18. My brother's 15. Three of us. That's it. On our own, not really any money, sell the house. Just try to figure it out. And that's how we start the world. So my college takes care of me, steps up in a crazy way and says, we want you to come back. Because I was dropping out, taking care of my brother, dropping out, going to run my dad's travel business. He had a travel agency. Like, run his travel business. Like, I have any clue. At the age of 18, I don't even know what a check looked like. My favorite thing was the only checks I'd ever seen were my mother's checks. They had like a sunset on them. So I thought, yeah, you get a sunset check. And then one day I was sitting with one of my friends and he had like a regular blue checkbook. I was like, what's that? What do you get those? Like, I got this little sunset thing. I got boats. And so, Harvard, small school in Pennsylvania, calls me and says, listen, come back. We want you to come back. We got you. And we got you. And they went back. So I ended up having the life I was going to lead. I put my brother in a boarding school. Yeah, we can ask you where did he. And he lived with me on the weekends. So he was with me on the weekends. And he's 15, turning 16, trying to pick up checks. You want to talk about learning life fast, being 15 on a college campus every weekend. So he's sleeping in my dorm room and trying to pick up checks on the weekend. There's a lot of fun. Just to bounce around a little bit, in hindsight, that's a lot to go through. It's really interesting. Since we've gotten to know each other more recent times, there's this kind of instant connection you have with people. I am very fortunate that that did not happen to me. But I would argue my parents losing parents at a very, very young age was foundational in how I see life. I grew up my entire childhood fearing my parents' death. And I mean, not like normal people who, like, it crosses your mind. I mean, like, it was the major backdrop conversation I had with myself my whole life. My mom lost her mom at six in the Soviet. My parents grew up in the Soviet Union. So like, let's start that. And then my dad lost his dad at 16. And it was just a huge currency in my whole life. My mom lost her dad when she was 21, too. So she, like, very quickly was down to zero. And my grandma, my mom, my dad's mom was around a part of my life. But it's interesting. Even though I wasn't the affected of it directly, it was a huge factor in how I see life. Of the three of you, how did you all take that moment? Well, my mother, they gave her six months to live. And she lived years. But she lived like a tornado. She was like, really? I get six months? Let's go. And she'd go to India and just blow out and come back two weeks later, walk in the door and start yelling at me that I didn't do my homework. I'm like, hey, where you been? And it was like war zone. But every once in a while, like, I'd be sitting in school. And the vice principal would come over and go, Howard, Howard, pull me out. It's classic. I go, what is it? He goes, it's your mom. And so I go running outside. And she's in the car. And I'm like, what? Are you OK? You OK? Because she had terminal cancer. She was going to die. She goes, yeah, let's go. And we go to the city. We go to art galleries. Then she'd take me to the opera. And then after the opera, we'd go get bombed at the local bar. And I mean blitzed. And I'm 15 years old. And I'm blitzed out of my mind. And then we drive home to Long Island where we lived what I called rodeo. Roll down the windows. Woo-hoo! We're like traveling. And just because she wasn't worried about dying. And I guess she wasn't worried about me dying either, which is little. And by the way, kids, just to give you context on this era, no seatbelts either. No, no, no. Just so everybody understands. This was real rodeo, baby. No seatbelts. Real rodeo. And let me give you something else that was happening on that highway as they drove from New York, like throwing the McDonald's out the window. That's how we dispose. It's crazy to think about some of the social norms of the 70s and early 80s. Anyway, nonetheless. So that was it. So I learned to live. Live every day. So let me give you a hint. Today is the joy of life. Right here. Right now. This is it. Never be depressed. I had non-Hodgkins lymphoma. I had cancer. And people would say, how are you? I'd say, I'm good. Because every day I'm alive. I'm going to make sure I'm happy. And I'm living my life. Because this is the joy. My view, I learned it from my mom. You don't die. You lose the joy of living. I believe in that shit, brother. My relationship with complaining is built on this thesis. Listening to what people complain. Dad, don't be mad at me. I know you always say, you give mom all the flowers and you razz me. But this is true. There was one time that I got pushed so far with my dad being upset about dumb shit that I said to him, you know, dad, and this is just for context for everyone who's listening. After a million things my dad has said in his life that he's complaining about. In business, normally. My dad is funny with business. He takes everything personal. I take nothing personal. So you can imagine our convos. But finally, there was one time, and I said to him, I said, dad, you know, I really wish something bad happened to our family just so you'd have something actually worth complaining about. That's how visceral I am to complaining based on this thesis. Everybody complains about dumb shit, and then something happens in their life that's worth complaining, and they get really reset. Correct. So I learned how to live for my mother. And then so I was always focused on living, because I learned it. I learned it when I was 16. Yeah. And so. Formative leaders. A lot happens in 14 to 18. So when my dad got killed, and the second one, you lose the second one, you're in hell. You're literally in hell. It smells like hell. Does it taste like hell? I didn't know what the hell to do. Yeah. I mean, my sister's 20. I'm 18. I don't know what to do. And it was a disaster. Everything about my life that day was a disaster. The lawyers stole our money. It was everything. Like you have kids with no one protecting them, and you just get shredded. You just got shredded. I didn't have any money to begin with. Whatever little money we had was shredded. So me, my sister, my brother, we just live. Was your sister in college at that point? So my sister was in college. So basically, he goes to boarding school near me, lives with me for one year. She graduates. And takes. Goes to grad school. And then she takes him. And she goes to Syracuse. Grad school, she gets a JDM MBA. And he lives with her, and graduates from the public high school right by Syracuse. So he just goes to the public high school. And then he just wants to be me, my brother. He just decides he wants to be me. And so he joins. He goes to Wall Street, because I was working on Wall Street at the time. And then eventually he joins me. But the thing about my story is I was really focused. I really understood things. And there's lots of stories about how I made it. But I got all the way to the top of the world. Yeah, let's be before we go to getting top of the business world and things of that nature, take me back prior to these incredibly challenging events. Prior to that, five. When I think about my professional career, so much was happening at 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, that I now look back on and be like, oh, this shit makes sense. Of course, I fucking, when it snowed and everybody wanted to make a snowman, I'm trying to convince Robbie Turner, Guerrero Godfrey, or Andy Greco, or one fucking kid in my neighborhood of, let's grab a fucking shovel and ring every fucking doorbell in Edison, New Jersey. Like, of course, it was in me. Obviously, you had these traumatic and life-shaping events. And obviously, you had a mentor in your mom that you just described about living. But your mom was there, obviously, in those years as well. Were you that person at 6, 9, 10, and 12 before these adversities came? What was seven or 10-year-old Howard? I was always figuring out how to make money. Always. So I'll give you an example. I would buy a pack of baseball cards. And then I would take all the old cards. And I'd make new packs. And some had one new card, and some had three new cards, and some had five new cards. And I sold them so that when I sold out all these, when I sold them all out, I made like three X the pack. But you took risk. For two cents, you might get five cards, which is way better. Well, you might get one and get blown out. And I would sell these cards. And I, of course, sold t-shirts. Remember the famous ones with the arrow? I'm with you, stupid? Like those? I sold those. Basically, I did all these things. I just hustled to make money all the time. We used to have carnivals in my house. Were you good or bad at school? No, I was a square. I was good at school. I played tennis. So I was serious sports. And I was good. My sister had fun and lived a good life. And my brother just lived through a world of shit with my family and health and stuff like that. Were you good at school because you were serious about tennis and you wanted to be on the tennis team? Or school came natural to you? Or you wanted to make somebody proud, your mom or dad? Or something altogether different? I think it was they had enough. They didn't need to deal with me. I didn't want them to have to deal with me. So I just said, well enough. Your sister was having enough fun that you saw them dealing with her. And you're like, fuck it. I just don't want them to deal. Yeah, they didn't have to deal with me. So I was just like, I just was fine. I was fine. And you learned. How much did the neighborhood raise you? Did you play outside a lot? I don't mean the 50s and the 40s. But were you outside constantly? Yeah, where I lived until we moved in the sixth grade, you would just be on the street. You'd be playing football on the street. Everyone would pick the name of some Dallas Cowboy or someone. I hope your name has gotten a little bit of wealth in that area. And you'd yell car. That's how I play. Off the street. Off the street. Car go by. Sorry. So that's the way it always was. And then we moved to more suburban, suburban, where there was no one else on the street. So then you just rode a bike anywhere. And then what you would do is you'd just ride your bike. And your parents didn't have any idea where you were. They never knew. And you just came back. My mom literally had no clue where exactly I was from 1982 to 1989. She knew I was in the general vicinity. But she would literally open the door and yell. Like full fucking, out of a fucking throwback sitcom, would literally open the door and yell about lunch. And then the way it worked, it was out of a fucking wonder year's episode. She would yell. And if we were more in the left direction towards Eric Gottfried, then my sister's friend Denise's mom would hear it and literally open her door. And then she would yell. If we were up top, closer to Robbie Turnick's house, Robbie's mom, Eleanor, would hear it. And she would yell in case we were by Bobby Duffy's. It was like fucking crazy. And I really genuinely believe that we're trying to blame a lot of things for where the anxiety and all this is. But the over-coddling of knowing everything about your kid every second of everything where they are, we were growing up. I don't know, fights and getting hit by a stick and fucking reconciling shit without parents, was you were learning how to function. My wife has never had a minute when my kids were younger than 18, where she didn't know where they were. Like one minute. Not even one minute. I'll be honest with you. I'm aware of how modern parenting last 30 years has been. How about the fact now that it extends way past 18, the amount of people I've met who have a fucking app on their 23-year-old to know exactly where they are physically at all times is fucked up. That's crazy. And it makes a 23-year-old feel like they're no shit they're acting like they're five. No fuck they suck at work. They're fucking zoo animals. They can't live in the jungle. They're fucking being tracked by their fucking 59-year-old parent. They're 24 fucking years old. They're on the payroll. They're being tracked. And then you're upset that they can't stand on their own two feet? No shit. You created a fucking bubble baby. I think the neighborhoods really shaped us. Fair. I think kids. I don't really think about that until just now. You're right. You're right. You're making my childhood where my parents, they had no idea who we were. And we just came back at night. When it was dark, I had to come back. I had to be at home within 20 minutes of darkness. How are you? There was a fucking thing on all our TVs when I was growing up that said, it's 10 PM. Do you know where your children are? Howard, I just need everybody to understand this. Kids under 30, if you're listening, listen to me. On television, which remember pre-internet, it was life. No phone, no internet. Television was life. 80 million people would watch an episode of MASH. At 10 PM, there would be this public service announcement commercial in the 80s that would come up and be like, it's 10 PM. Do you know where your children are? Because sometimes they forgot that we hadn't come home yet. Be a parent. That's right. Attempt class, be a parent. Try to pay attention, be a parent. I mean, it's crazy. Anyway, I was just curious. I really do think the East Coast, and listen, the West Coast got their skater, surfer version of this. But fucking 60, 70s, 80s, New York, New Jersey, Long Island, just that outside. And it was just fucking rough. I just think, I really think, until you get punched in the face, you're not fully a functioning real man. And I think that, and that's figuratively or. No, the bus. The bus was a war zone. War zone. War zone. You go on the bus. The bus driver, my kids, they have no idea. We had a war on the bus. You have a war on the back of the bus. When modern bullying became a thing in the last 20 years, I was like, oh, this is sad. Let me get up to date on this. When I dug under the hood, I'm like, oh, you mean every day from the first to 12th grade? It's just we're in a very different era. And it's, by the way, what concerns me is it's so obvious. It's similar to what happened with the Roman Empire and every other empire. A lot of what Europe has amazing strengths, but a lot of its shortcomings. It's just sustained prosperity. It's hard to be hungry when you're fed. All right, so I graduated. Talk to me about the trends. Yeah, I'm glad you were here. So I graduated from college. Yep. A friend of the family connects me with Bernie Cantor. And I get a job. And I get a job. Educate everybody. You're in your own world. Tell everybody a little bit about Bernie Cantor. 99% of people are like, who's Bernie Cantor? They're looking at everybody. So before I get a job, I have a summer job. And I get that summer job. A friend of my family gets me a summer job. And he puts me in a company that's on Wall Street. It's a brokerage company on Wall Street. I don't know anything about it, but it gets me a job. All my friends go to Europe for the junior year abroad. And I go to work. So I get an apartment in the city by myself. And I do a summer sublet. I used to go to the Village Voice. Yeah, I guess sublet. And you look at a sublet in the back and the classified ads. I mean, people don't have any idea. You look at the newspaper. And I get this apartment. And I go to work. What year is this? This is, I guess, it's 80, 81. Kids, again, I love doing this for the audience. New York's a fucking shithole. Just so you understand, 1981, 80, New York, it's the New York you think it is. Like all the kids that come in intern here that are still a little bit in a bubble, they're like, oh, New York is way less scary than I thought. 1980, New York was a fucking shithole. The city was bankrupt. It was a mess. This is right before the Reagan thing kicked in. This is like a tough New York. Yeah, it was fun. But, you know, so I got a job. And I go work there. And I had a summer job. But I stayed for the whole semester. So I worked there six months. Oh, interesting. I wanted to work. I didn't want to look at it like a movie. I wanted to do the job. And so I pushed to do the job. And then. At that point, Howard, just to educate me, did the Wall Street gig, was that like, you go here, you make money? Was it was the brand of Wall Street epic? Or like, where was the brand of Wall Street at that moment? Epic. That was your way out. So when you had no money. All the street kids in Brooklyn, the Bronx, the Yom. It's like we don't think of private equity now or the way to make big money. It was the way out. Right. So you just thought Wall Street. So I was just thinking, well, but I didn't know it. Like you said the word Wall Street. After that, I had no idea. Right. You knew that. I could have been anything. Right. Wall Street equals money. But you had no idea what the fuck was actually going to be. See, I had the worst job or the best job. I was just random, whatever I did. So I got this job. And I just wanted to do the job. And I figured out that I, the boss, right? Just figure out how to get him with the boss. So I just figured out how to get him with the boss. I would write the boss notes saying to this, this is happening. Did you know this is happening or this is happening? And at the end of my six months working there, the boss calls me into his office. He never spoken to me the whole frigging six months I was there. Never. I would send him notes. And they'd say, you don't have to say fucking on this. But you can't. OK. Yes, sir. Just like a sense how hard. I'm trying. I knew what I knew. I'm a guy in a suit. You know, I'm a guy in a suit. I get it. But I know who you are. And I just want you to know that you found a very good place to be. You can get away with all of it. Go ahead. All right. So then he doesn't talk to me at all the whole time. And then he calls me in the last day and he takes his desk out. And he's got every note in the room. Wow. And he starts talking to me about this and this and this and this and this and this. So it was really good. Epic. And then he offers me a summer job next year. Right. So I got a summer job next year. So I'm cool. I'm golden. And here's that big moment. I learned during those six months I was getting direct deposit, where they put the $250 a week that I was getting paid into direct deposit. They put it right in the bank. Yeah. Right. So when I go back to college, right, they send me the pay stub. And I'm like, no, no, no. I call the boss up. I said, no, no. I went back to school. You got to stop. And he goes, you coming back this summer? I said, yeah. He goes, ah, keep it. So I thought he was giving me $250. No. $250 a week. He kept paying me. The whole semester. And when I got the second check, I went to the dining center. And I leaped onto the table. And I did the whole thing. I was like, yeah, I got $250 a week. A week. 1980? I took girls out to restaurants. I took girls to restaurants. I bought gas for a car. I was like, the king. I was the king. Going to restaurants, $250 with inflation in 1980 in the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania. I'm surprised you didn't buy fucking restaurants. It was a lot of money. So it was so I was like the man. Because I would buy all the beer for everybody. It was like, fine. I was great. And then I went back that summer. So that company buys a division from Bernie Cantor. So Bernie Cantor is like this famous industrialist guy, famous Wall Street guy. Rockstar, largest collector of Rodin's in the world. You know the thinker? Yeah. Right? Like he's the man. He's a wing named after him at the Met. And he sells a division to these guys. These are just regular Italian guys. And they buy the company from him. And they invite me during that summer to work on that deal. So I'm sort of in the room like the young guy, like whatever. I'm just the young guy. But I'm a pet of the boss. Because he likes me now. So Bernie Cantor sees that I'm a pet of his. So they call me up and they offer me. They say, whatever he offers you when you graduate, I'll pay you though. Wow. So they'll offer me like 20 grand. Right? So now I'm going to make 40 grand going to Canaanfordshire. Again, I need everybody to hear this. 1981 or two, whatever year we're talking about, 40 grand. It's real money. Real numbers. Yeah, yeah. That's real money. It's like making 100 now. It's like a hundred and hundred. But it's different. And you know this. Because you definitely know this better than I do. But 100 now, with the way everything is played out, with all the money that was printed, it's just I just want everybody to know, it's a lot of fucking money at 22 years old in 1981. Go ahead. All right. So I walk into Canaanfordshire. So I take the job there because they offer me double. And I see this guy and he's a rock star guy. And how big is the brand Canaanfordshire at this point in Wall Street? It's a great middle market guy. Meaning he's not Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, but he's like the next level there. Right. It's respected. Yeah. And it's the number one bond firm in the world. So I go in there and I'm like a big swinger. And I think they love me. You think you're a hot guy. I'm a hot guy. Come on. I got pay me double. They love me. And the guy says, listen. So they send me into the president's office, who I've never met before. So he sits me down. He goes, listen, we hired you because we hate the other guy. And we knew you were his pet. And we couldn't give a shit about you. Just get the fuck out of my office. I love it. So I walk in like I'm a big swagger. And I walk out like he just steps on my face and pushed me like, and I'm like, we've come out. I've always thought. I've always thought from afar. And it's fun to say this to you now that your life would be a real movie. I'm so pumped. I really hope that scene isn't in me. Because that's a fucking epic scene. Because my ego was so big. And then I'm like literal roadkill. Like I'm the squirrel at the end. Like I just got smashed. Actually, I want to make this a learning moment for a lot of people. No bullshit. Don't hyperbolicize it. If you don't remember, you don't remember. But I'm just curious. Real talk. How much did it crush you? Like for real, for real. Kind of just for the afternoon, for a week. Or did you say, you motherfucker, I'm going to have your job? Like how did you handle it? Actually, no bullshit. I was just stunned. I was just crushed. Like I didn't see it coming. You know, it was like I'm like this. I got the view. I got the view. I got the view. And it just hits me like right from here in the side of the head. And I was like, why didn't you look that way? Like I had no idea it was coming. I was like total, total like slammed by a 2x4 in the head. And I was like wandering around. So I'm wandering around the firm. I felt like, you know, like, you know, what did they like got a Seinfeld episode of? You know, I just, I'm wandering around. I've got the Pinsky file. You know what I'm looking at? Like nobody cares about me. You know what? So I had to go find myself a job in the firm. Like literally I walked around the firm, try to find the job and they're paying me 40 grand. They don't give a crap about me. I know I'm going to get fired. Right? I'm just going to get fired. They just wanted to just mess with the other guy and screw. They didn't care about me. I was just, I was just dirt. Did you think about finding someone to latch onto? Like a mentor? Like a person that saw you value in you? So this, this is the first lesson. Okay. So you go into the trading floor and the trading floor is just this vast like football field with the people. Okay. And I said, all right, what, what the hell am I going to do? Like I'm lost. And what the hell am I going to do? So I said, all right, first lesson, find the winner on the floor and no one's helping me. Okay. So no, I can't ask them who's the winner. Who's this and that? Find the winner on the floor. So I said, I start walking around and I'm watching. Yep. So I picked the guy. Real quick, I apologize, Howard. Real quick kids again, this is the blessing that you don't realize you have. There's unlimited free fucking content on the internet that will teach you absolutely everything. And now with AI, you can ask it and get it in a nanosecond. This is literally an era where you have to like do what Howard's talking about. Like now everything is at your fucking fingertips. Perfect. Can give you 97 answers. He could have DM'd a thousand firms and gone somewhere else. No, he had to literally walk around a fucking football field and just look at humans. Look at human beings and try to pick the winner. So then I try to pick who's the winners. Try to sense who's the big dog in the room and who's the winner. And I walk up to him and I ask him. How long were you watching? Three days? Two weeks? A month? Because if I didn't have a job within 48 hours, I thought I was fired. That's what you thought? Yeah. Because this guy said, I don't give a crap about you. You're walking around in days for 30 minutes. You kind of calibrate and you're like, fuck. I better get a job. I better get a job. So I go in and I'm just looking. And I find the guy who I think is the winner. I just pick. OK, that's a guy who's a winner because you can see other people are like listening to him and something that. So I walk up to him and I say, what kind of coffee you like? I just get him coffee. I go out and I just get him coffee. And then the first thing. Another fun thing, kids. Good news. Coffee's were like $0.12 back then. Like didn't have any of these fucking bullshit $7 fucking. No, no. Black coffee, $25. I just went to the coffee machine. No, no. There was no downstairs. There's no downstairs. There was no Starbucks. No, no. It was 1980s coffee. I thought you went downstairs to the fucking coffee vendor, like the hot dog guy and gave him a quarter and brought him a fucking black coffee. No, I went. I found the coffee over there. I forgot it's Carter Fitzgeralds. Yeah, I just bought the coffee machines. OK, and then what I realized is some guys would treat me. So I started doing that. I picked like five people because I didn't know what to do. And I just would get him coffee. And I'd say, look, I'll do whatever you want. I'll do any chores you want. Anything. Because I have nothing. Right? I have nothing. So the only thing I have to give her is energy. 100%. That's all I have to give. So I'd say, look. But you've got to take care of me. And some people would just walk by me the next day and they'd say, black with sugar. They thought I was a coffee guy. Of course. And so then I dropped that guy because he thinks I'm the coffee guy. I'm not the coffee guy. He's not in. And then I found someone who I liked. And he decided he liked me. So he said, sit down. Then I had a job. He'd sit down. He said, sit down. And then that was my job. Rick Chapman. Rick? Rick Chapman. Rick. Rick Chapman. And Rick Chapman. And here's what he did. He said. Where did Rick live? Actually in New Jersey. Because I mowed his lawn. You know what town? I'm a Jersey boy. I'm actually genuinely curious. I don't remember his town. OK, no worries. Go ahead. I mowed his lawn. So he's in Jersey. I mowed his lawn once because he said, if you mowed my lawn, I'll do this for you. Because what happens is he became transactional. Which is a fucking gift for you. It was everything. That was the greatest thing that ever fucking happened to you. Because what was I doing? I was buying an education and it changed for energy. It's great. So I would mow his lawn. I'd pick up his dry cleaning and get his car washed. But what he did was he called his best client. And he said, you go get your young guy. Pick your favorite young guy. I'm going to bring my young guy. I'm going to go out to dinner. Huge. And he takes me out to dinner. I tell you what. Rick, his client when he retired, called me up and said, he sure could buy a steak. Right? Because he's buying it on his. You know, remember? Of course. You had a great expense account then. He got to really nice restaurants by really good wine. So he takes out me and the other young guy. So the first nice restaurant. So you must have loved it. Oh, yeah. I loved it. But I knew, OK, there's a 23-year-old on the other side. He's mine. OK? I'm going to be his best friend. Love. OK? I'm going to be his best friend. Of course. And I was just his best friend no matter what. OK? No matter what. So I said to him, when you trade, someday you're going to trade because he's not a client. It was called Solomon Brothers. It was bought by Citibank. So it's part of Citibank. And they were the best traders in the world. I said, when you trade, you got to call me. Just ask for me. Just give me. And I'm his best friend. Then I'm following around. I'm buying beers. And on Saturday night and stuff, I just go out with him. Like, I'm his bestie. And that's when I learned to cut the line. Because what happened is on Solomon Brothers' line, the top guy, Rick, he's got a Mercedes. Yep. Right? The next guy's got a Chevy. The next guy's online, online, online. And when you went to Mercedes, you're going to be 46. You're just online. And this guy's going to retire. You blow up. I'm up. But I said to the 25-year-old, call me. So he gets the call to start trading. And he picks up the phone to Canaanford Steele, which is the place to trade. He says, I want Howard. And this guy stands up and this giant trading floor goes, who the hell is Howard? And I'm like, me, me, I'm Howard. And I literally go running across the trading floor, and pick up the phone for Peter Hirsch. And Peter Hirsch does my first trade. And I just blew past this guy, and this guy, and this guy. I'm now second or third in line. Why should have a Chevy? And I'm on his phone trading with Peter Hirsch. Because I worked him from the day I met him. He ends up becoming the boss of all trading at Solomon Brothers. Because he was a winner. And that was lucky. But his favorite guy, he picked the favorite guy, and I picked favorite guy. You're talking about the single variable of business that people don't talk enough about? I have 45 Peter Hirsch's. To your point of luck, I have 157 people that I thought were going to be Peter Hirsch that didn't end up being Peter Hirsch. But net, net, here's a news alert. You just need one or two, let alone 45. Correct. So I just worked it so that he introduced me. And then that created me cut in the line. And other things I would do. I'd go to a bar at night with my friends. So I'm well dressed because I work on Wall Street. And you go to a bar at night with your friends. And I'd go to Brother Jimmy's every side. It's like your feet stick to the floor. And I would walk around, find other people well dressed, and ask them where they worked, and buy them a beer. And my friends were like, what are you doing? And I'd say, look, I don't know anybody. I need to meet people. I don't know anybody. So I'd meet a guy, and he'd say he's in advertising. Any friends who work on Wall Street? He goes, yeah, yeah, Chuck works on, yeah, he works at Goldman. He goes, hey, Chuck, this idiot wants to buy us a beer if you say hello to him. And I'm like, fine, I'll just buy him a beer. So one of those happened. I met one of those guys. He worked at Lehman Bros. By the way, every firm I talk about, they're all, I'm so old, they're all out of business. Every firm is coming up. But I'm 48, and I know all these I-Cons firms. When I was building the wine business, these were all my customers. So this guy works at Lehman Bros. And that company that these guys bought from Bernie Cantor, it's going public. And Bernie Cantor's really interested in it. And Lehman's doing the deal. So I asked my friend who I met at Brother Jimmy's, just buying him a beer. I said, can you get me that early draft of the document, because my boss would really like to read it. He says, well, it's secret. But it's an early draft. I mean, it's not illegal, right? It's just an early draft. The company doesn't want you to see them undressed before they're ready and all set to go. And so he drops it off to me at 6 o'clock at night. He says, I just need it 6 AM in the morning. And I go to my boss's Bernie Cantor's house. And I give it to him. He goes, where did you get this? I go, I know people. Who did I know? I knew the one guy. I met him at Brother Jimmy's, but I bought him a beer. And that's how like, so Bernie Cantor thinks, oh, this kid. He knows people. He's working it. I was always working. Energy's the right answer, Howard. You know it's funny. I don't use that word. But it's the answer, right? Like when I think about that story from Cantor's angle, like it's who I was and it's what I'm attracted to when I see it in others. It's not super complicated. It's what coaches appreciate in athletes. It's just fucking life. Like effort is a fascinating variable in the game. It's just so goddamn obvious who fucking wants it. Yeah, so people think you need to be really smart to be successful. And what I say is, you just need to be really clever. Yeah. OK? If you're really clever. And I would argue that clever. You can be successful. But I would say that's semantics. Because what you're actually saying, I think, correct me if I'm wrong. And it's funny. I use clever a lot. I think you're talking about kind of like the way our, you know, we're in enough of a similar era. Like we grew up, unlike the kids today, where like what college you went to and what your grades were, were the binary indicator of your horsepower. And you and I grew up in a little bit of a three. Brother, can you do me a favor? Actually, I really want this would make me happy. You were good at school. But can you grab that top? Can you grab that? Are you transcript? This is my report card. I just want you to look at it while I say this, and then we'll go back to you. Like, I, I, it's back. Yeah, show the ladies. This sucks. Yeah. Look at the bottom. Look at my class rank. I think, I think, it depends. It's hysterical. It depends on how, it depends on how you define smart, right? Like, you know, for me, one of the things, you can put it anywhere, one of the things that was very obvious about this, and I want every kid to hear this, people skills. Man, if you could tell me, can I be great at memorizing shit for a test to get an A or have outrageous people skills? It's a fucking thousand to zero in the favor of people skills. Like, right? Like, like, it depends on what is smart. Clever, to me, is just slang for being smart about the actual shit that fucking matters. Humans. You're smart about people, which is what matters, right? So if you can get someone who's smart and clever, game over. Then, game over. That's, that's what a billionaire is, OK? A billionaire just has both those things. They don't have, you can make huge amounts of money with one, and you're a professor with the other, right? If you're super smart, you're definitely a professor, OK? Because you're super, super, super smart, but you don't have the other parts. Have you had both? Oh, it's another one. Let's keep going on this story, because this is a lot of fun. Where does the next tipping point happen in your career? I have an idiosyncrasy of my life, which is I'm a reader, OK? I mean, I have to read the thing. I have to read the thing. It's now the bane of my existence. I mean, I can't sign the end of a document without reading every friggin' word. This is probably why you were good at school, right? Because reading comprehension is such a variable in that game, and so you, you have very strong reading comprehension. Yeah, really strong. If I listen to something or see something, I will never forget it. If I read it, it doesn't fucking even, I'm none. So when I read it on the reverse. When I read something, it goes into the end of the year. Something bad is in the document, it comes on me. Like, it's physical. When I read it, it's physically on me. So like, I could be reading something. That's how I am on a young. And I'm angry. Like, it's making me angry, and someone's looking at me going, why are you so angry? No, you should see what this says, and they're like, what? What it says? Why would that make you angry? I'm like, so that's just the way it is. So, you know, so a friend of mine mentions something to me, that there's this railroad, and the railroad, when the United States of America was being built in 1897, the United States of America decided they wanted to industrialize the country. And it took, by eminent domain, it just took people's land, and it brilliantly built the northern Pacific Railroad that went from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the southern Pacific Railroad that went from the, right? And it just built railroads across the country. One. And I, and the guy mentioned, he goes, you know, this land is probably worth a fortune. So I go to the library, and you do microfiche, which basically was like a negative, and you put it on like a light box, and you read it. I mean, now you just go to an iPad and look it up like this, but then you had to go dig it, so I dig up the deal, and I find that all this land, Union Pacific Station Philly, Union Pacific Station San Francisco, Chicago, and all the mineral rights going all across Montana, all the way through, all this land is in this company called Burlington, Northern, and they got it for free, and they issued $150 million worth of bonds, and by the way, if you want to understand interest rates, in 1897, they issued 3% bonds, doing 100 years, and 4% bonds doing 150 years. So interest rates have been between 3% and 4% for frigging 130 years, so when people say, oh, aren't they so high? You're like, no, this is like ordinary. What about 1980 when you started your career? They were double digits, right? 12, 14, 16. So I go to Bernie Kanner. I walk into his office, right? So he doesn't really know me, right? But I'm like just doing this stuff. How many years into Kanner are you at this point? I'm 25. So still fucking early issue. Three years. And I go, okay, here's my idea. Here's my idea. We take over Burlington, Northern. It's about $4 billion. Then we sell the railroad for like $3 billion, and we'll lose a billion. And then we'll have all this land that I, my genius 25-year-old self, who has done absolutely no work and hasn't called a single frigging person. So I say this land is easily worth $4 billion. Because it's all this land, the middle of the rights, $4 billion, and we make $3 billion. What do you say? What do you think he says? Get the hell out of my office, I'm listening to you. So I keep every day I pound on him. And ultimately he gives me $2 million to invest. So I buy these bonds, interest rates are 12%, and I buy them for like 63 cents on the dollar, because 3% if you buy it cheaper, the math is you get you 12%, okay? Because you bought it cheaper and they go up in value over time. So whatever. So I buy $2 million worth. But I'm not the only one who knows this. The chairman of Burlington Northern announces he's gonna retire and he's gonna take the land out of this trust, which I read about, okay? And he's gonna put 300 million in US Treasuries in and take the land out, okay? But I read the documents, and I know what the documents say. And I also, when I was planning this, I called all the bondholders, I knew every bondholder's name, because I wanted to control the land to do this whole deal with Bernie Cantor that I made up on my own. And no video, so no one knows it's a 25 year old making the calls, right? So then I say you can't do it. So I call all the bondholders and I say, give me a proxy. I hire a shithead lawyer, okay? I don't know anybody. I hire some lawyer and we write a snarky letter to Burlington Northern saying you can't take the land, it's in trust, you just can't touch it. General counsel of Burlington Northern calls me on the phone. He says, what do you got? I go, I got $2 million worth of bonds I bought at 63 cents. He goes, all right, here's the deal. I'll give you two million bucks. You keep your frigging bonds. I want to take the land. And then because you're gonna put treasuries behind it, the bonds are gonna go up to 2 1⁄2 million. So I'm gonna make $2 1⁄2 million and a $2 million investment in six months, no risk. Double A bonds, no one's ever made any money in double A bonds. They move like a tortoise running across the street. You say, this baby's gonna run across the street. There's no money in it. So I walk into Bernie Kanner's office. I said, now you believe me? I just made 2 1⁄2 million bucks on a $2 million investment in six months, no risk. They just paid for land. Now to Bernie Kanner's credit, he says, all right, what do you think I should do? I said, look, they're gonna split this land off, this land's worth a fortune. I told you it's worth $4 billion. I'm still making it up. Okay, I stopped and called a single person. He gives me a hundred million to invest. He buys a hundred million at Burlington Northern Stock. They announced they're gonna split the company to Burlington Northern, the railroad, and Burlington Resources, the land. DuPont comes in and pays $6 billion for the land. The stock goes up, doubles, right? As it's doubling, he sells as fast as he can. He makes a hundred million dollars, okay? And he gives me a bonus of $1 million, 25 years old. My friends are like, he made a hundred million, you only got a million? I'm like, what do you got? What do you got? I got $1,250 bonus. I thought I got a million dollars. I just need everybody to understand, this is 1983 now, four. No, this is 86, I'm 25. Again, I'm just sad because money got weird because we just printed a fuckload of it in the last 20 years. And that's the answer, by the way. All inflation has come from printing. You just do not understand how much a million fucking dollars is in 1986. Like a hundred thousand a year in 1986 is profoundly wealthy. The way you think of someone who makes two to five million a year now. It is that big of a delta, you don't understand. That's insane. Can I say one thing to the three of you? I have bad news. I like, actually, I'm a businessman for a living and I have a hard stop in 10 minutes. So I have bad news, we're gonna have to do part two. We're only at 20, how old are you? 25. No, no, right now? 63. We're only at fucking 25. So fans, I just want you to know there's going to be a part two. If I have to go somewhere and you come back because I wanna keep this going, but I'm not gonna be able to. So like, okay, go ahead. All right, so then. We haven't even gotten to anything yet. Okay. Just so everybody knows. It's gonna be like fucking Star Wars when I do three episodes. But now I'm a rock star. Okay? A massive rock star. Rock star. And it's 1986 too, so the Reagan thing's full effect. New York's out of control. It went from a shithole to really becoming what the precursor to what New York is now. You must be out of control. So then there's a stock market crash in 87. Right, October, Black Friday. Right, stock market crash in 87. Actually, I don't wanna skip over that. So you make this massive stitch in 86. You're like rolling now. You're like envisioning everything. Correct. World domination. How big of a, like how much did you get fucked? Cause you might have not, cause it might not. I'm gonna get fucked. And so Black Friday, you weren't in a situation where that really destroyed you. No. But did it scare you of like, oh wait a minute. It's not always just up, up and up. I might, like was that something you took note of? All right, so here's that. Okay, so in April. Of 87. Of 87. Right, cause it happened in October. Interest rates, interest rates start leaping. Okay, they go up 100 basis points in 87. 1% up and they're going up, up, up, up, up. And I'm thinking this baby's gonna crash. This baby being what they call me. The market's gonna crash. The stock market's gonna crash. I go to everybody, say short the market, short the market, short the market. So I, and the firm won't let me short the market cause who am I? I'm nobody. So they're not letting me do anything. Right? So I can't do anything. So I start borrowing money from everybody I know to short the market. Jesus Christ. May, June, July, I borrow money from my grandfather, which bad news if you can't pay him back. And I borrow from everybody. Okay. And the market keeps going up. And you don't remember, but in August of 87, the market hits absolutely new highs. And I am absolutely completely and totally broken. Every way, all the money's gone. Everything's gone. I bet it all. Interest rates are flying. I'm saying this baby's gonna crash. And it's hitting new highs, new highs. And I am broke. And I borrowed money from everybody and shorted it. Stock market breaks in October. All right, but that's the way the world works, right? It comes after you go broke. But one friend of mine, I borrowed money from him and he was a stockbroker in California. And he bought options that matured at the end of October. And it hit. And it hit and I earned enough money to pay everybody back. And I lost all mine. But imagine I borrowed 10,000 bucks from you. And I walk in after it crashes. And I go, I give you a 10. You're like, oh, Howard, you killed it. Meanwhile, I had to go back to my grandfather and borrow money to pay rent. And when you go to your grandfather and say, I need money to pay rent, that is really painful. Because that million bucks you made in 86, did you invest in it? Oh, no, I bet it. I bet it because I was definitely broke. And I was completely right. But the moral of that story is timing is everything. Timing is everything. So I was busted. But then I do another one in 1988, where interstate banking comes. So a friend of mine tells me that interstate banking, outside, basically, you could only be a state. Remember, Citibank was New York Citibank. Citibank, yeah. Because you could only be in New York. That's right. You could only be state by state. And then we're going to break that up. So Pennsylvania says, OK, we're going to let outsiders in in a year. So I figure out, OK, why don't we buy a crappy Pennsylvania bank that's got nice locations. It'll definitely get acquired. So I go to Bernie Canter. And I said, OK, here's my idea. And this time, he goes, all right, let's go. Let's go. So it's 1980, he says, let's go. Not only does he put 100 million in, but he tells all his buddies. Because when you're a rich guy, you want to do that. I get it. He puts all his buddies in for $50 million. And we buy this company called First Pennsylvania. Six months later, it gets bought by Jurrard National Bank for $12. We pay $6. Verizon for $12, back in New York comes in. Right after, Interstate Bank comes and buys for $18. $6, $12, $18. We go up straight up, triples his money. He makes $300. But he put up $100. He gets $300 back. So he's a profit of $200. Guess what he gives me? $2. And now I got money again. He's back. I got money back. So basically, I got money again. All right. I got money again. And now, OK, he liked me the first time I made him money. He loved you the second time. Now, he's loving me. OK, now, whatever I'm going to do. I'm very aware why Steve Ross likes me. When you start putting up more than one win, it matters. That's what happens. That's right. Now he loves me. And now it's 1988. And now I'm on fire in the firm. So I'm managing his money. I'm managing all his friends' money. You're on fire. Every bet I want, I'm making. My income starts to double. So if you look back at me, beginning with $40,000, then I made $80,000, then I made $160,000, $320, $650, $1,000,000, $3. Now, if you keep going, if you double and double and double, so now I'm making my normal job, I'm making millions a year. Millions a year. Plus, I did this for this extra. And Bernie Kanner's in love with me. He's in love with me. How old is Bernie at this time? So he dies in 1996. It's 79. So he's in his mid-70s. He's mid-70s. And he's in love with me. I've become like his. I'm totally. And now I'm not the kitchen cabinet. 1991. He fires the president of the company. The guy who told me, you're roadkill. Oh, no way. That dude? Yeah. And he says, and he promotes me at the age of 29, I become the president of the company. So I'm the president of the company. We're growing. The company's on fire. It's growing. It's rocking. And then 1986. So the deal is in the company is I hire everybody. It's like you're hiring everybody. And everyone says, OK, what happens if something happens to Bernie? You know, Bernie Kanner's like the owner. What happens? And it's like, I control the company if something happens to him. And so if he dies, it's me. And you'd say, cool. All right, you're hiring me. I'm cool with that. He goes on life support. And his wife decides she's going to try to sell the company. And so we have a giant fight. And I go to my lawyer. What do we do? He goes, let's not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. You have a straight flush. Just do nothing. She hires Kext, this big PR company. And I get a call on Friday night. We have a big court date coming. And on Friday night, I get a call from the New York Times. This woman named Diana Enriquez. And she says, listen, I've been working with Kext for three weeks. And I'm going to write the rip in this story that you're an asshole. And do you want to talk to me or not? You're the cover of Sunday's New York Times business section. What year is this? 89? This is no, no. Now we're all the way up to 96. Just so everybody knows, even though the internet is out in 96, like it's the 1996 internet, which is like, it's still fairly small. And like this business, like this is the punchline of the, like every single person of any kind of anything in the business universe in the world, let alone America, reads the Sunday business section. This is a big deal. Right, so I decide, you know what? Screw it. I'll talk to her. Smart. So I sit down with her and talk to her. And she writes a story with partners like these who needs rivals, right? Her picture, my picture, and Bernie Kander's picture, like gigantic, and he's on life support. Anyway, I win the case in every possible way. And I buy her out. And then my son is six days old. OK? And I hold him up in Delaware. I'm in Delaware where we settle. And I buy her out. And it's over. The company is now my company forever, forever. It's my company. And I hold my new son up. Like Simba. Yeah. And I'm like, hey, good old, you know what? Like, you know, that's it. And I'm like, you have no idea. I look at my little boy. And I say, six days old, like you have no idea what a good day you just had. You have a big, lucky sperm. He just did it. And so then that was the day the firm was mine. Wow. OK? And then I went and hired everybody we loved. Because the rule was, if it's my firm, I'm only going to work with people that we like. That's the rule of the company. I make that the rule of the company. And we work with everybody we like. So I say it this way. We all have the same rainbow friends. Now think about your friends. Think on this side, smart, capable. You know the winners. And the ones on this side, crazy. Make you laugh in a ball harder than anybody else. But you know, a little what? And I'd say, just hire these. And that's my firm. We hire. So my brother joins. My best friend joins. My college roommate's brother went to Harvard Business School. He runs banking. Everybody. I hire everybody I love. But I make that the rule not for me. Of course. Everybody. So every, the security guard hires. So I don't have to worry about them. You know, if one of them has to go to a wedding, the other guy fills in. You know, it just. Family business. That's the firm. Family business. That's located on the 101st to the 105th floor of the World Trade Center. The plane, it's a fucking building. I don't know. You know, when my friends get killed. I lose my brother. He's 36. Lose my best friend. Now he's 39. And I lose my best friend's brother. I lose everybody. Everybody. But everybody loses everybody. Everybody loses everybody. It's like, look at this office. Right? And say, OK, everybody dies. OK. And you're taking. I was taking my son to his first day at kindergarten. That's it. That same son. I'm in his first day at kindergarten. So I race to the building. I race to the building. And I get to the door of the building. Because I'm just trying to grab people. What time did you go to the office prior to first day? I don't know. 30. Yeah. The show is on. All right. Your show is on. OK. At 848, the show is on. Everybody who matters on September 11th is in the office. It's not a holiday. There's no reason to be out. Everybody's there. It was my first day at kindergarten for horseman. My best friend, Doug, his kid, goes to Riverdale. And he dies. Because it's not his first day of school. Everybody dies. Everybody's dead. And I get to the building. I get hit right to the building right away. My phone keeps ringing. As it turns out, my phone kept ringing. I kept picking it up as a flip phone. And it was no connection. It was my brother calling. So I get my sister on the phone when I'm going downtown. Because someone, they tell me a plane hit the building. But I don't know. I haven't seen it. They just hit the plane at the building. I figured it's like some stupid Piper Cub, some guy clipped the building. You're an idiot. So I tell my driver, I said, just go to Fifth Avenue. Because I know you can see the building as soon as. And it's just flames, just smoke, just pouring out of the place. And he starts crying. I said, let's just get there. Let's just get there. And I kept my sister on the phone. And she said, I spoke to Gary, my brother. And I said, oh, what did he say? She goes, I got him on the phone. And he called. And I said, well, thank God you're not there. He goes, I am there. I'm calling to say goodbye. I'm going to die. Smoke's pouring in. There's no way out. There's nowhere to go. I'm just saying goodbye. I got to die. I tried to call Howard. I can't get through to him. I'm just telling him I love him. I'm sorry. That's it. That's it. So I just go to the building. And I'm just hoping people can get out. I'm just hoping some way there's people to get out. But I know they're all in there. And I know there's nothing they can do. And then I'm standing at the doorway of the building. I'm grabbing people, asking them what floor they came on. And in the highest floor I get to, it was like 90, 92. And then I hear this sound. This loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's like Titanic. Remember the movie when it breaks in half? That's the sound. And I don't know what the hell is going on. So I start running. I got my suit and tie on. Right? My shoes on. And I'm running as hard as I can from nothing. I have no idea what's going on. I'm just running my ass off. And I look over my shoulder and a black tornado is chasing me. You saw that smoke sort of rolling? And I'm running as hard as I can. And this tornado is chasing me. And then the tornado comes across this way. And I see the tornado come and so I dive under a car. And I hold my head like this. And it just goes whoosh. And then the world is black and silent. And I'm not clever enough to put something over my mouth. I have no idea what's going on. And I'm thinking, son of a bitch, I was uptown. And I was safe. Now I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Because it's thing about it's black. And I'm holding my breath. I'm like, I can't believe I'm going to die. I said, actually, I can't hear any sound. I'm dead. This is dead. I can't hear any noise. I'm outside. It's dead silent. So I take my fingers and I go like this. Because I can't see. My eyes are open and it's black. And I stare myself in the eyes. I'm like, ah! OK, OK. I'm blind and deaf. But I'm alive. So I stand up. Of course, I'm hiding under a car. Smashed a little bit out of my head. Now I'm bleeding off the side of my head, self-inflicted. So I climb out from under the car and I get up. It's pitch black. So what's the first thing I do? I start running. But of course, I run to pitch black. So what do I hit? Park car. I go, fine, I'm supposed to park car. So now I'm bleeding. I'm limping. But all self-induced. And then I realize, OK, OK. So now I'm walking like this in the dark. And then I see a flashlight. So I walk to the flashlight. And there's a cop holding the flashlight. Just holding it up like this. So I put my hand on the back of his collar. And I said, let's get the hell out of here. And he sits down. He just sits down. Because he's in shock because this thing went right through him. And so I said, give me that. So I grabbed the flashlight out of the guy's hand. And now I'm walking in my flashlight. I find a coffee republic. You know, some coffee shop that's blown to smithereens. And I go in and I find a bottle of water. And there's a paper towels. So I take the paper towels. And then I put the paper towels under my arm. So I got the giant flashlight. Got the paper towels. Got a bottle of water. I start walking. As the smoke starts to clear, it gets lower and lower and lower. My driver jumps on me from behind me. He's like, Mr. Lennon, you're alive. You're alive. I can't believe you're alive. Because he's a retired detective. And he goes, you're alive. And I turn around. He goes, where do they give rich people like flashlights and water? He's like, who gets flashlights and water? Like, where did you get this stuff? And then we walked uptown. And we just walked uptown, knowing that they were all dead. Well, I'm sure everybody was moved as much as everybody in this room. I really beg that we can do part two of this. Sure. And I thank you. Thanks, man. We'll see you next time on Part Two. See you soon.
