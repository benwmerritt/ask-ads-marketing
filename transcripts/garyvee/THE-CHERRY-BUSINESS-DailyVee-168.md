Early helicopter life, Matt Higgins and AJV. Oh, it's really a sight. Or the Lippa. That's going to make me put you on it twice. Macro. I'm from Mom and Casual. That little guy like gravel. Coming back around like a lasso. Macro. Macro. Like a vision boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts with some of our equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. And me and my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty in the earth. I'm moving furniture to bevel. I just think it's worth the risk. I don't care if you're somebody that uses big data and you're good at synthesizing it. I don't care if you're the greatest natural talent like I am and you just live life and it just comes to you. I just don't care what your process is. It's just get me to the insights. Get me to the thing. To me, I don't know what brand strategy. It's Karen, 27 year old. She has two cans. Or it's the manifesto from the brand. Or if it's like find it. Here's what I know. Every piece of business needs us to find the white space. The problem with either or or anything we come up with is the humans are going to break it. So, let's start with that. Let's start that no matter what we decide here, it will not work. And I'm being dead serious. What I mean by that is it's what human beings do. It's what they do. Depending on their level of ego and pride, humility and thought, like teamwork. So I think my job at the top of the spear is to give thought to things that position less friction not more. And I'm not saying having an overarching idea is that. But that is the only filter I'm going through. Awesome. Thank you guys. That helped me. I just said myself, you know, that progression we're always talking about. Can you think of any brands off the top of your head that have just died out because. Radio and television. The first wave. Or TV to phone. Whatever that looks like. Yeah. TV to phone. Well, you know what? You can say it's happening now. Cool. Not going to be a lot. You can show that. But if you could like might want to be able to guys, we're going to play music over what just happened, but it was fucking brilliant. Okay, well, listen, then I'll be frank with you. Like if that's the case, then that's what I'll do. So I'll, I'm going to go to Alan's office right now, literally walk out of mine. Are you? What's up, stranger? Guys it's DRock. He does other things. I do. How was your day this week? Great. What's going on with the episode? Love both ideas and they're like, oh, can this extend into print? Because if it can. Everything can extend into everything. Of course. And if it can, show us both ideas in print and then that'll help us decide which one. I see. Okay, good. We're completely... Can you do me a favor? Can you tell them that they should be, they should really, really consider running both in print on Facebook against the actual consumers that they want to buy it and read the quantum quality against it. Just tell them that as well. Tell them I walked in and said this. Yes, this, do your thing. Have you thought about how smart it would be to spend $50,000 to have these two pictures $25,000 media spend. We don't have to do it. I don't even know what their fucking MSA is. We just want to tell them what to plan against. I don't know if it... 27 to 42 year old moms with families and run them and then read the quantum quality data because that would also give them a data point of the actual end consumer for this debate. Three seconds left. Should say to watch the whole thing. Go to Facebook.com. We have more. Nope. Three seconds take over the whole fucking thing. Not no half credit. People don't want to go to brand. You'll lose 80 to 90% of the thing because nobody wants to go to a brand's website but they'll go to Facebook. And I actually think the way to do it is to say go to Facebook and search. And you guys just have to see how it's coming up. Yeah, so just jumped in. We've got a huge new client. So I jumped in to refilming it. Nice job. Make sure you blur out the stuff. Huge new clients. So the team's excited. I'm excited. Big new brand in the building. Big new holding company in the building. Key moments is where I like to come in and sprinkle. I think managers and CEOs do really poor job and they want to bake the cake and put the icing on and the sprinkles and the cherry. And that's called micromanaging. It's just a bad idea. To me, I want to be in the cherry business, right? Like I believe in my team. Go make the cake. Go make the icing. Go make the sprinkles. I'm just going to put the greatest fucking cherry you've ever seen on that cake. That's good. Read a book called Crush It. How'd you get it? Do you know? My dad was into it. My dad is the one. My dad's a huge mentor to me, much like your dad is to you. And he's the one who kind of told me about it. I was like, that I'm not really into reading. I hate to read. Me too. It's a huge challenge for me. So to me, the things I think most about are number one, two, three and four is to build self-esteem. So my belief is that self-esteem is the only drug that combats the world. I genuinely believe that. In parallel, it's imperative that you don't build fake self-esteem. Self-esteem can't be manufactured through rewarding, non-rewarding events. So like participation trophies. Correct. You can't come in eighth place in the race and school and then get prized for that because that's just not real life. However, Xander, for example, this weekend, when Max got hurt, his nephew, stopped what he was doing and came over and showed amazing empathy for a four-year-old. That has become now the thing I've talked to him about for two days. He's incredible. You have such a great heart. To me, you triple down. This is, by the way, this is me being a byproduct of being what I think perfectly parented. This is what my mom did. My mom over-exaggerated my natural goodness as a person to make me believe it was the most important thing. She never gave me third-place trophies and when I lost, I lost. She made me realize there were repercussions in life. When I got bad grades, even though she knew I was going to be very special, I was literally punished. Subconsciously, I knew that it wasn't the most important thing in the world, but I do like that she punished me and didn't let me completely disrespect the system, but she never let it hurt my confidence. She played it very smart. There is something interesting my parents did. At 14, they said, look, tough guy, you're not going to be a student, things are going to work. That means you're going to start working now. I do think one of the great things my parents did, and I think a lot of parents should think about this, is if you don't have a student, even if they're an artist and want to sing and paint, you need to figure out how to establish massive work ethic because the only thing that's controllable for somebody who's going to bet on themselves in life is their work ethic. Their talent, you can get it better, you can get better at things. My calves and ass aren't naturally the same as everybody else. There's people who are naturally like, I don't like my chest is never going to be as big as I necessarily want it. There's certain things that are right, but meanwhile, I'll sell you back the hat you're wearing right now. I will. I think it's important to teach work ethic because work ethic is the only thing that maximizes what you naturally have and that's really the best you can ask for. This is my new favorite office. Let's go. Juice. Juice, how are you man? I was great. Great. We've actually met before. Remind me. It's you, Sam. Oh my God, yes. I was like, hey man, I'm not here for you, I just want to say hi. I'm going to see you at the end of the month. I remember. I want to apologize to you really fast. When I met you, I hit your shoulder in a weird way and I hit your throat. I have a meeting with you this month with Alex each time and I just want to say... I'm so amazingly strong now that I don't remember that. My big thing right now is Facebook long core videos, influencers on Instagram and what I would call hacking culture. Anything that can penetrate and create noise in a million different things, that could mean a million different things. For my personal brand, not my brands and other things, that means that I genuinely believe that hip hop is the seed of our culture. I just genuinely believe that. I think it's a good use of my time, especially when I'm lucky enough to have somebody like Mike Boyd in my life, where he just genuinely has a great track record. Of course, DRock and these guys are always looking at Spotify and SoundCloud and every youngster spends time trying to find new artists and different stuff of that nature. I just play the same Lionel Richie song over and over. People love Discovery, but I am very fascinated by what's happening in the cross section of the two places you're playing. My dream, to give you as much value right now as possible so that when you do become massive, you're like Gary V was always there. It's not super complicated. It's that truly basic for me. I'm Gary V, baby. Much loved everybody watching. Shout out to you. What's happening? How are you? Good man, how are you? George. It's a pleasure. How are things? Thanks. Love it. I'll call you whatever you want. Fuck man, I'll call you whatever you want. Tell me the call. I've always loved comedy. Yeah. I did stand up, which was like great and terrible. Stand up taught me to do that I could do anything. 100%. Like doing stand up and I told a girl was like, stand up was the most important thing. 100%. 100%. So any sale situation I found myself in, it was like nothing. You feel good enough to have to just have to give you money. 100%. But the problem with stand up was I was sitting on the jokes for like a week, two weeks, a month until I could get to a microphone so the energy would just die. So when memes happened I was like, this is sick. I can make a joke, find a picture, make a joke, get it out to people, get feedback and go from there. Onto the next thing. So for somebody like me who's always going, it's like memes, right timing, whatever. Of course. It's just been good. But my Instagram, techsenatra is like just taken off in a way that's been so rewarding. It's so awesome. It's crazy. It really is. How many are you at now? 850. 850,000. Amazing. How often are you showing your face on the techsenatra account? On the story pretty regularly. How about on the posts? On the posts, like once a month maybe. Change it. Yeah. Tomorrow. Here's how. Ready? Ready? Yeah. Ready? Yeah. Minimum. Stick with me? Go ahead. Minimum. Yeah. Minimum. Like you're much bigger than me but I'm not going to let you get away with it. Minimum once a week. Minimum. Okay so. Fuck. How many posts are you doing? A lot. Like at least six. Yeah. I would tell you that if I could help it, I would have you do it once every two days. And you know what I would do? Straight to face video and I would just have you do your thing. If you can actually do stand up, fucking do it. Straight to the face. Like you got the, you got it man. Like my face. Yeah. I like it. I just, yeah it's a look right? Do you summon like memes and those who over well? Dude listen to me. What the deal? I mean what doesn't go away if your account went away? The memories of you. Yeah. You look like every other fucking page. I know. I used to post more selfies and I got so, I was like you know what fuck these people. I'm sure you deal with it. The negativity, you don't. You just don't make comments. I don't give a fuck. Sure. I read every comment. So I say that. I say I don't give a fuck. But you do. But I do a little. But guess what? Me too. No I'm just like, you just don't give a fuck. No I do. I do. But then I don't. Like it's 5149. I give a fuck. It's so aggravating. Not, I'm empathetic. Yes, sometimes. Do you understand that I actually feel bad for them? I do too sometimes. And I do 100% times. Sometimes I might send you your address. Yeah I'm gonna beat the, yeah listen if I look like you I'd probably beat up some people too. Like look, punchline is very simple. I actually feel bad. Like you're in a place in your life where you have pain and you're taking it out on me because in this moment you deem that I have happiness. I feel bad. Yeah. You smell good bro. Thank you bro. Appreciate it. Yo if you're not following the tank you're making a fucking huge mistake. Fucking up. Fucking up. Fuck you up. You know. He may want to bring in our people. He may want to audit everybody. We gotta think about all those things. Like if people understood the money, the happiness, the fame, the, if people really understood what I was doing they wouldn't believe it. That's why I actually spend no time on it. I'd lose. I'd lose because you think I've been trying to sell you something that like it's only because I'm playing such a long game. Longer than anybody actually. Like I fantasize of being 73. You know and having the body of work. You know. So I understand but that's where that was going. Okay. Thank you. Oh wow. Oh. I'm not a fan. You know it's full time. Like it's just. Yeah it's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. It's just. What up. I was really hoping. Thank you so much for your note. That was very sweet on the daily. You're on smile. What? No. Yeah, right there. You said you missed me. That was very nice. I know but I but I absorbed it. I don't. I don't do a cancellation. I can't believe this is there. They're quiet. I'm really excited. I'm a math. There's only one. There's literally only one reason I'm here. The singular reason I'm here. Is I'm going to take a selfie with this guy and get him so many instagram followers. You remember you did this on staff, can't you? But like through your head. Yes, but. But you want business advice. But ready? I got this. I'm so happy. Dude, honestly, it's crazy what's going on. I'll be honest, I like the content a lot lately. I appreciate it. Well, because I keep talking about it. You're awesome. I'll tell you why you like it. Because even when I first got to know you, and when we met at Newhouse or whatever, people that like it are people that like, I actually think it's strategy, disguised in like motivation. Like I think the reason people actually get results for me and not from everybody else is, is yeah, I'm very rah rah and just in me. It's who I am. But like, I actually build businesses. Like this is my side hustle. Like I know what the fuck I'm talking about. And like the people that are smart, like actually like will like, and they watch what I'm doing more so than like get pumped. Like you only live once, yes, you only live once. But if you actually understand why I'm doing it, how I'm doing it. I love that one by the way. It is good. It's my favorite cause it's so impromptu. She like scared me first of all. She like rolled up on me in the car and like, ah, it was such a. I kind of wanna. Three words. It's getting the inspiration for any day I'm feeling down. Three words. Three words. You're gonna die. Wait, wait, wait, Tyler, say something. How long is your Snapchat? Remember when we were just talking? The food, I enjoy the food. I enjoy the atmosphere. Great vibe.
