24 months of eating shit to be able to eat caviar for the rest of your life. Macro. I'm from mom and casual. Got it like ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro. Macro. Like a visual boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Tabba motherfuckers, I've been telling you. Countdowns was talking about equity. I'm trippin' like I'm giving a pedigree. That meanin' I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to travel. Yo what up everyone? Happy Saturday. Hope life is good. Really appreciate all of you. Thank you so, so much for all the love. Just thank you. Today's Daily B is all about Mike Playa. Playa's good friend, Jett's friend. My brother, Alex, is a good friend from post college. We became super friendly. He was in the ticket business and he came work at Vayner for a year. Actually something most people don't know about Vayner toys when Mike was the foremost expert in T-Dating. Gary doesn't like to talk about Vayner toys too much. I don't like it about failures. We'll tell the story about Vayner toys actually in a different episode. Maybe I'll do it today when I walk. But now it's crushing him. We're just talkin' about his next chapter and giving Benji Kleiner shoutouts. It's all about Hamilton folks. Hamilton. Life advice for youngsters is always part of the equation on a random Saturday. So two quick things. Number one, this tweet about eating shit went out and caught a lot of people's attention and thought I'd expand on it. I just am surprised by how many of you don't realize that the leverage in the world is always the thing that is less obvious to the masses. Meaning giving is a better strategy than taking over the long term. So I'm just gonna give as much as I can on this channel and then eventually one day, somehow you might owe me a favor. Eating shit and taking it and being the bigger man and woman in every situation which is really my definition of eating shit is something I do every day. Every day, 95% of the time I have the leverage but I don't use it. And to me that is leadership. To me that's playing the long game. To me that's building relationship. To me that's building confidence. To me that's a million different things that I think a lot of people misunderstand and is the thing that really separates the winners from the losers in my opinion in society because I think it's super easy to throw around your big stick at every moment but I think eventually you run out of haymakers. You become a weird version of the boy that cries wolf. And so for me, I'm pretty passionate about really focusing on eating shit. On looking at the comments and laughing them off. On allowing my managers to get away with something this time. Just a lot of versions of it. It's actually so kind of hardwired in me. It's very similar to the customer's always right. Just deploying enormous empathy. I just eat shit constantly. I love watching people thinking they're getting away with it but they're just creating check marks in the loss column that I'll eventually expose or use or act on or not. I mean, my preference is I never have to act on it and I can play that 51-49. Now VaynerSports. Back in, Rowan the hurricane came here in New York. Back in the day, Mike who you saw earlier was trying to convince him to leave his job because I thought he had a lot more talent and as a middle move, I created a business called VaynerToys. I might've just said sports by the way. VaynerToys and him and Lou who works at VaynerMedia now and a friend that I grew up selling baseball cards with Lee Platt and a cousin of mine, Sean Gorellek. And ultimately that was the model issue, right? Hit the button there by accident. Ultimately that was the issue with the business. There was too much overhead against the strategy but it was basically VaynerToys was the 2017 eBay Flip Challenge. I had this really interesting 2017 challenge. It is my belief that everybody has a ton of chachkas. We're gonna have a $20,170 challenge. Could we create a side business that could make hundreds of thousands of dollars by buying and selling stuff from thrift stores, garage sales, junk auctions. The answer is the revenue was there. I created too much infrastructure because I was trying to really build a team around a lot of my homies. And so the dollars were there but I treated it too much like a hobby business. I treated it too much like a place to put a bunch of my friends and cousins and relatives and relationships. And ultimately we were just losing money and there was no reason to do it but I absolutely believe and especially since I've seen what's going on now it empowered me to very much believe that there was 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 thousand dollars a year in profit to be made if you took this seriously. And what I love about life is I really focus on every negative becoming a positive and going through that confirming what AJ and I were doing by seeing what VaynerToy's short six months look like confirmed and gave me the audacity to create the 2017 flip challenge that hundreds of you, thousands of you are gonna be impacted on. I cannot wait for the end of this year to watch all the people who bought homes, paid off loans, bought a car, went on a family vacation all because of a piece of content I created and that makes me super happy. Oh and a quick PS, a little clip from two years ago on Ask Gary Vee. Instagram game is really fascinating to me, betting hard on it all of you entrepreneurs should. A little rant I had about Instagram, it's been fun to see that play out. It is the number one social network as the attention graph goes. By the way, I need to desperately make an attention graph. Like we gotta get into that, cause that's what I care about. Over time and that's one of the great things about documenting all of this, being able to do these fun recalls two years ago, if you were on this train, if you were paying attention, you might've gotten deep into the Instagram game that I'm trying to really focus a lot of you guys on and really that's my biggest number one. Like I'm gonna give out the value and I hope you act on it. See you tomorrow. Guillermo Ar lament power
