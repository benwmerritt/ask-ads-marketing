## Transcript
6.40 in the morning. I left DRock back at my apartment by accident because I moved up my car 15 minutes. We miscommunicated, so I've got to film this. If you're not dreaming big for yourself, who's doing it for you? Sobbs, I've been telling you! Gentlemen! What up my man? Good to see you! DRock, what's up? How you doing? Good. You guys, are you awake? I'm awake. The question is that. Did you hit the genie this morning? No, that I haven't done. So we're going to do that in Canada? No, I'm doing that when I lay... I'm flying in right back. So I'm back tonight? Yeah, I have stuff tonight. Original content. So my ability to communicate things that matter to me. And then, I don't know if you have this, but I have the swipe up. You have it, right? I mean, that's, you know, I mean, that's a huge deal. I'm getting about 10%. It's a fucking 70, that's insane. But I'm doing it every day, like 15 pieces, so that will happen over time. But still, what the fuck, exactly. That being said, you're still probably going to be able to hold 50%. Hotel room. Always working. Yeah. Just two camera nerds. Just camera nerds. Camera nerds. How do you spell camera? What's that? C-A-M-E-R? I don't know. How do you spell camera? E-A-N-E-R-A. Yes. It's like, we're like, this is a picture of a quote in Russian to 29,000 reach. 160,000 comments on that. I mean, like, people really, the appreciation level is extremely high. And, Spanish is the one, I'm really kind of like paying attention, like Chinese. Like, look, like the reaches, because I'm just, I'm only targeting people in my fan base. I'm not running ads even. This is not discovery. This is within my own ecosystem. But the shareability is so high, because so many of these people have been waiting to be able to share my content. The amount of fans you have that want to share your content. Who's translating for you? Individuals. Amazing. Amazing. Plus, I love the inclusivity of it. Well, that's just incredible. 93% of them, like the second it happened, literally thought they were Hollywood stars, moved to Hollywood. Well, okay. You did. Like, I mean, they literally moved there. They literally wanted agents. They literally needed to be in a movie. They literally played it different. And I would tell every one of them, I'm like, this is the game. We're very late. Random hallowing, like, crazy on DM. You get a random hello. Hashtag, oh, surprise hello, excuse me. No, I don't want to walk. I want a surprise hello. Can't walk and surprise hello. Both. More. More. More. Fill it in there up, DRock. Look at that shin. Look at that shin. Great shin. I show shin. I show shin. He shows shin. How do you spell shin? I got it. Listen, I'm happy about that. I know. DRock, DRock. Here, I'll clear up one. Surprise hello, just DMs, just go fast, like boom. One money, making niche. Send message, paste. Surprise hello, little heart. Just want to thank the one for the attention. Humble. We'll never forget. My tummy hurts a little bit, which is rare. Kids are playing basketball. I want to beat their faces in right now. You know, you'll know that window, DRock. I want people to see these kids. I want people to see these kids. I want to kill them. I would not let them score. We're here, we're like falling off. Did I get it? Did I get it? You got a thought for your group? Real quick. I'm super late. Awesome, man. Thank you. Hi. Nice to meet you. Okay, let's do it. Awesome. See you in a little bit. How's the Q&A set up? I actually want to do, based on the audience, I want to do a lot of Q&A. Okay? There you are. Wow. Backstage. I'm going to go back to the studio. I'm going to go back to the studio. I'm going to go back to the studio. I'm going to go back to the studio. I'm going to go back stage now at a church here in Ontario. I'm going to have to hit the stage hard. With serious vigor. I'm going to teach you more about selling and marketing right this second than anything you'll learn in any school ever. Thank you. When you give with expectation and return, you lose. Thank you. Javjav Jav right here is give, give, give, and too many people interpret it as take. Javjav Jav right here is give, give, give, and then ask. That's the cadence. Especially when you're asking for something as big time as an internship at Vayner that has become super competitive. That's when you've got to do your homework and what the value is. It's awesome that you can do a flip and that would be cool on camera. It feels super selfish. I feel like you're going to win twice. Awesome. Yep. Do it. You did? They're going through it. There's like 4,000 emails. We'll get to you. Awesome. Take care, man. Here's what I think is teachable. I think that most people that are not nice to other people are broken inside and are unhappy inside. I think through real psychological work, therapy, real self-evaluation, really hitting rock bottom, some shock to the system like taking a year of vacation or getting a divorce or having that conversation with their father about that thing that happened when they were 11. I mean, there's a million things that I do think can unlock a drain. I think they're the hardest things in the world to do and I don't take it lightly. I've not been able to do it so easily. So I don't think it's easy, but I do think it's achievable. I think it takes an enormous amount of self-reflection, acceptance, and humility on the part of the person that's doing the actions and it takes a complete reset of who they are from a hard wiring standpoint. So I would say yes, but 99% of people I don't think will pull it off. I mean that by the way. It's very hard. The practicality, the grind, the work, the real stuff, the meat, the potatoes, everybody wants the sizzle. Everybody wants to write the article about the billion dollar kid. The problem is there's three of them, right? And there's hundreds of thousands of million dollar kids and there's millions of hundred thousand dollar kids. The problem is everybody's trying to map their behavior to the three trillion dollar kids and they'll fail and we need to take that off the pedestal and we need to start putting the pedestal and putting the people on there who are driving practicality and reality because as I'm talking to you I have enormous fear of what happens when the economy gets softer because it's been good for nine years and that's why everybody's kind of floating around and pretending the part of founder. Those people are going to be working at Bank of America and Toyota in five minutes so they need to get practical real fast. I would be careful with that. I would tell you my argument on this issue is that every generation has its people that wanted attention. Every generation had its people that wanted money. I think we're very lazy as a society and throwing people into groups. I know plenty of lazy 40 year olds and 50 year olds. I know plenty of 40 and 50 year olds who always wanted work life balance and taking vacations. I know plenty of 40 and 50 year olds who wanted one on one attention and I know plenty of 20 and 30 year olds who want the money. So I would say and I know I can tell by your vibe you're going to agree with what I'm going to say which is I spend zero time on the macro of what's going on in the world of the current conversation. It is always one on one. Meaning what does that person want right now because guess what? What DRock wants right now and is 29 years old five years old. You know what he wants today is going to be different in seven years. So like not only is it one on one it's one on one within a moment. So much. I'll talk to you. What's that for five minutes. I know you know what's going on with the car. Make sure to remember that. Cool. All right. Good. I'll be with you in a few minutes. Let me back this up. Come with us. I know. Yeah. The last time was easy. It was like going to a next game. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. You got this again. You've got to reverse it probably. Come on, bro. We got this. All right. So, we're going to literally take 15 seconds to close our Likes. And if you need, tap out because I know you got a plane to catch and I don't. I just want people to know they have time. Way too many fifty-five year olds think it's over, especially because we live in this tech world where it's all about the 20 and 30 year olds like never before, and we just have time. I mean, I think I said this to you and I'll say it to all of you. I feel like I'm just starting. I'm like, okay, now the foundation. People are 33 and they have two kids and find themselves in a job and like, fuck, what? You have time and you're in control. And I just want people to realize they have one life because that's practical, that's true. That's actually, listen, by the way, if you can prove to me otherwise, I'd be really happy. Get in here. Yes, one second, this man first though. He's got the put in the work shirt. So Danny, we're doing video. Yeah, cause I'm a, go fast. Danny, I've been in the media since I'm a video. Hey Danny, take care. Bye bye. Safe travels. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, gotta go. Bye, Gary. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Dude, hurry. I'm gonna miss my flight for your fucking selfie. Let's go. They're right. Yeah. Yo. You're taking it back to see you? Let's go. Yeah, like we're dropping them off around the corner. This is just the, this is the easiest way for them to say how do you go. Good to see you brother. How are you? Good to see you. How are things? It's great to see you again. It's great to see you. Thanks man. How you doing? Good, how are you? Good. I'm just really tired. Not, you know, the energy of something like that is so over the top, right? That's awesome. Have you been? Do you really want me? Good man, good. What's going on? Coming to New York this May. What are you gonna do? I know Andy, I know we were making a bunch of different decisions, but what do you need my help otherwise? Can I help you in a different way? I need your help, right? Yeah. I'm just like, in terms of like when I go there, just like connecting. Connecting? Yeah. Yeah, I'll help you. Just messing up. Okay. Okay guys, let's go. Can we just see how you do it? Yeah, I'll message this guy. Take care of Kasey's in there. Yeah. Let's go see him real quick. Thank you brother. Is Kasey here? Yeah. You know, I think we're quite a block. You guys are gonna shoot at the shots. Yo, I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. Are you leaving? Yeah, I'm missing my flight. This is a good prelude to maybe Hamburg or something we gotta figure out. We will. Dude, how'd it go out there? The love of the crowd is, you know this. You're the king of this. I love it. I love people. I'm not the king of this. You're going back to New York City right now? Right this second. I was literally gonna miss my flight, but DRock said you were back here and I'm like, I gotta give him a kiss. Don't miss your flight. Thank you for the kiss. I won't. See you later. Good to see you brother. Bye guys. Good job. Bye, thank you so much. All right. It's 12.15 here. I know my man. I'm sorry. All right. We're gonna be late for this flight. It's gonna be tight. Three. We should be okay, right? We're checked in, right? We have customs. It's gonna be tough. Let's see what happens. I mean, yeah. I mean, I just think I can. Like I've done really well and I'm only 41 years old. And you know, I'm not gonna be a Mark Zuckerberg, you know, kind of Mark Cuban, one big event, tons of money. And you know, I hope I stay healthy and my family stays healthy. And very frankly, I hope Woody Stiles stays healthy. I need time. I need time. I think I went with a different kind of vibe. Yeah, I think it's very good. Mm-hmm. Whatever we have to do to paint a different picture in your mind, then we'll hack at it. You know, because it's going well. It really is. I mean, I appreciate your aspirations, but I can't let them come at the expense of your mentality. And that's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. I think it's good. And that's good, man. By the way, by the way, the KPI, the big, the big win from this is learning that. The big win of being in my inner circle is the thing that I haven't brought up a lot lately, which is 99% of things don't matter. I appreciate that you want to do great things. Not at the expense of your... Not at the expense of your... Yeah, I mean, if you outpressure yourself, you're not gonna be able to achieve it. Like I have the biggest ambitions of all time, but I'm also extremely comforted in accepting my shortcomings and not everything's gonna work out perfectly. The ambition for perfection is the quickest way to not achieve perfection. Let's try it from what it is. Yeah, yeah. Out in California, counting up my blessings, only 24. With a multimillion dollar pension off my catalog. That's cause I'm a don, like Cheeto, cause I'm on and I got more songs than the Beatles. Whoa, that's a stretch. Yeah, I guess, but you get the gist. Laughing at the skeptics, cause I always knew I get to switch. Family new and boogers new, that's probably about it. Quicker you come in the game, the quicker you go out it. Y'all ain't really bout shit, y'all ain't got no substance. Yeah, I heard your little viral song, some fun dumb shit, some one month shit, you're a seasonal rapper. You a bitch, the world fucks, cause we leaving you after. Don't hit my phone with some stupid shit. That's not why I gave you my new number, you stupid bitch. Delete and block you, I don't have to, but I want to. I'm just trimming the fat. Haters drowning in doubt, meanwhile I'm swimming in cash. I was never cool with y'all, don't try to link up now. Because my train left the station, but it's a Brinks truck now. I switch up styles, like I was dating by doots. Common to hate on the truth, I'm carving my name on the roof. I hip hopped and breaking on through to the other side, like Jim Morrison. Guzzling Jim, wondering if I drink more than him. Scary thought, I got the juice like Barry Barnes. I ain't trying to blend in like white kids with fairies on ya. Faker than these rappers who keep trying to claim indie major connections, millions behind you. You're not indie, get defended and I got you by hip hop's collar. Cause guggas told me that only a hit. Dog Hollers, top dollars, what they pay me for the flows nowadays. Free weed. Not gonna catch me sleeping ever again. Free women, free clothes nowadays. And all we got is time, so my time is my investor. I'm single, so I save money and live better, yeah. I need my plaques advanced, tell the R.I. double A. Underrated and overlooked, yes, but never underpaid. Blew off the web like Peter Parker. Went from flying 32F to private jets, getting charred. So just landed back in Jersey. And that's fun. I was like landing in Newark, just little Jersey love. Little Holland tunnel up in front of us. Love that place. Anyway, great speech this morning in Canada. Hectic boom boom. Little boom boom boom. Little more more more. Casey, nice that. Spoke after me. Finally getting his last name down. You rock, I'm proud of myself. Boy, I'm bad at that. Anyway, Casey's amazing, obviously. Always fun to be in the presence of somebody who's got a bigger social media following than you. He crushes and on YouTube does his thing. I saw on social a bunch of people talking about and quoting. And I forgot, and it reminded me, which is when I invest in his company, I told him like, the idea is solid, but very hard to execute. We'll see. But I'm betting on the jockey, not the horse. A lot of you have heard me say that. But this was a successful investment of mine. I invested some six figures into Casey's company. And it returned when he sold it to CNN. And it solely happened because of the jockey. And so more and more in my life, I'm paying attention to ideas are fine. But it's the people executing them that really, really, really matter. It's nice to hear them say that. I'm feeling at the apex. I feel like I'm entering the prime of my career as a jockey. I think these next 20 years are going to be the best entrepreneurial years of my career, I really do. And because I think at 16, what have you all be focusing on the jets and family stuff? And I could just see a change. I could feel I'm in it. I'm excited about it. And that's humbling to hear from Casey. Thanks for that, Casey. And thanks for all of you guys' attention. I had a lot of you say today that many people said today, multiple people said today, when I was giving love back and sticking around for the selfie and almost missed my flight. I'm proud to be giving you my attention. This seems like a lot of you are paying attention to what matters to me. And so I'm grateful and thankful and appreciate it. And hope you're enjoying this journey as much as I am. I realize that the journey is everything. There ain't no destination, man. The journey is everything.
