## Transcript
What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? So it's Sunday, late afternoon, late workout today. Something good just happened. Yeah, I'm rolling on that blue thing. What is it? What is it? Anyway, something really good happened. What? I'm not live. I'm recording the L.E.V. Jordan said something really good that excited me. You know, I can't do it that way. Anyway, something good happened. He tasted some humble pie. He just asked me how long was the video? 14 minutes. He just asked me if the video was too long. He said it could be too long. I said no, because if the content is good enough, he was talking about a perfect chin-up video and how it didn't hit. Obviously, since Jordan started working with me, his social media game has dramatically improved. As you can imagine, my muscles have improved. Fuck man, this back thing. Anyway, he's had some really good success amplifying videos for like $100. That's what this one was, right? Yeah, this was like $100. My social media went from like... No, no, don't tell him the highlights. Tell them how you lost this whole episode. This is back. You know, I'm just thinking back to two or three videos that I've made. I like talking about the videos that I knew were going to be big. Got it. Sometimes they're not big, even though I thought they were going to be big. That's what happened to you. Yeah. And that's what's happening to you guys all the time. And so I get in. So this is a perfect... It's like raining outside. Patrons are about to play. Your videos sucked. They had a lot of bad things happen. A bunch of them got sad because they were thinking about their two cents while people were making three from yesterday. It's a grind. This isn't 365 days of glory. Jordan lost Thursday. Like sitting here, he's just like pondering. He's like, why didn't that happen? I don't know what I'm... It was such a good video. It was one of my best videos. No, you said it was your best video. It was like the best video I've ever made. But the market gets a side, not you, Jordan. Exactly. I lost. But I learned. That's it. Learn from your losses, everybody. That's the way it is. So anyway, I just thought it was a really interesting way to... I knew today wasn't going to be a big episode. So as I'm sitting here, just literally just called DRock. I was like, hey, put this on together. I'm going to make a one second video. We'll just do a mashup. And then I was just thinking about what Jordan said. I said, you know what? Wait a minute. This is exactly what we should be doing today, which is in a 365 day world. The truth is the majority days are losses. The majority of days, it's not going exactly as you wanted. And I think you do learn from it. I do think that a perfect chin up video is fairly niche. And that's why I may be a 40 target in the wrong group. Yeah. You know, I don't know. Anyway, have a good day, guys. See you tomorrow.
