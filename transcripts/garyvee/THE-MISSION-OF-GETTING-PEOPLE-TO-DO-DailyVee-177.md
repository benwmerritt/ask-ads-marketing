Almost that time again. He's one, he's two, with my trusty outfit. I turn into... Airport Gary. Because we're gonna be legends. Gonna get their attention. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. Here we're gonna be legends. Gonna teach them all a lesson. Got this feeling in our souls we can't... What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? The day after Steve. How are you? How are you? How are you? Yeah, late. How are you? Good, man. Good to see you, man. You going out an hour? I'm out just before you. I'll warm up for you. I'll pick it up, I'll get it smoothed out. See how it runs. You're a really good friend of mine, Bob. Gary, I don't want to disturb you. I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you. Sure, of course. Thank you so much. One most important step in the beginning is that you jump from being a small enterprise... It was always selling. It was always getting new clients. It was my ability to sell new clients as we learned how to do what we were gonna do. If your ability to outsell yourself is there, you always have a business. And the most important thing is to keep going. Not just to start it, right? Of course. That's the main thing. It's pattern recognition. AI, voice, VR. We're gonna see it. 3, 4, 5 more times. 9 times out of 10, the guy who doesn't bolt is fine. There's no tiger in the bush. But one time out of 10, there's a tiger in the bush. We're the descendants of the one who ran. It's true. We got these patterns because it's true. I like that. You can get really far ahead of each other. By the way, if I hadn't lived through early Web 1.0, Web 2.0, the social media thing, my statement about VR consumer, I wouldn't have said 10 or 20 years. I would have said the next couple of years. You learn that it takes a little bit longer than you think. When it's that big of a ship. I'm just gonna record what you're saying with my app. Do you want me to hold it? Yeah, that'd be really cool. Full service. I'm full service. Give interviews, record. That's cool. How do you manage to create all of this content? It's really great when you have DRock around. For everybody who doesn't see, I have a DRock, David Rock, who films me. I have a full team now. I used to just put in a lot of hours. When Twitter came out in 2006, I spent 12, 13 hours a day replying to people. I put in the work. You know this. You're not accomplishing what you're accomplishing without the work. That's it. You sleep less. You watch less TV. You play less games on your phone. You create. You work. But it's patience. The biggest thing that I'm scared of for the people that are watching right now is they do it for three months. They do it for six months and they give up. I did Wine Library TV, my first thing on YouTube, for 18 months every single day and nobody was watching. But I knew it was right. And so if I could give any advice from an old man here, it's patience, which is very hard when you're 13, 16, 19, 22, 27, because you want it so bad. But patience is the game. DRock, when do you think the manifesto... Do you see people are starting to pick up on it because it was in that episode? I mean, we really, really, really... Let's really drill it. Yes. Hi, Tina. I just want to make a photo. Sure, sure. It's okay. I can do it. Yeah, of course. We just want to do one more game. Yeah, no worries. You know, getting to travel all around the world, it's just really fascinating to me that the online Rockstars event here in Hamburg, Germany has become one of the premier events. It comes down to... It comes down to... People need permission. Yes, that's right. It's not about... People are confused with the answers. I've given the answers 50,000. I'm going to give the same answer. You're not more with the same responses? No, because I know every single time this is going to be the time one person hears it when they need it to and they'll do. To me, it's the mission of getting people to do. Not, you know, I don't get bored. It's, you know, you know, the platforms change. So, you know, it used to be like, make a MySpace page, be a blogger, right? Yeah. So the platforms change. That keeps it fresh, but the thesis stays the same. I'm stunned by the lack of practitionership in our space. W-H-W, right? Like, what are you going to talk about? So many of you in this room have not started. Whether you're talking about yourself or your product, you've not started the process. Now, the reality is, so many of you are at such an early stage, that manifesto should actually just be your mission, right? You haven't done anything yet. You know, this whole fake it to you make it brings no value to anybody. You need to tell me what you're going to do, which is very scary because you actually have to execute on it. The next part that so many of you have to think about is how. Facebook video, YouTube, crushing it. But there are so many people in here that shouldn't be producing video because that is not the best way they communicate. Actually start understanding how this is all working deeper, not wider. I leave the future to the people that are building the future. What I'm good at is tasting the future very quickly and executing within it. I think the biggest thing that holds people back is fear. Fear of what other people think. I just want to look back and feel proud about what I said. Okay, thank you very much. I got to go. Change my life. Thank you, brother. I'm so excited about this. Very excited. Thank you, guys. I got to go. I'm excited. Hard work is not fun. You know, it doesn't come natural to a lot of people. We always had people that talked. We always had people that were lazy. We always had people that complained. And so, yes, I think that's human nature because it's very difficult to be successful. Yeah, I mean, but that's always been media. You know, now it's a bunch of people throwing up Lamborghinis and watches on Instagram. They used to be lifestyles of the rich and famous and infomercials. Like, again, nothing's changed. People do the same things. The mediums have changed. The behaviors have stayed the same. You built Vina Media into an international agency in six years, right? So, what has been the best decision you've made so far? That's a good question. I think the best decision I made was to not waver from the strategy. You know, when I started selling social media in 2009 and 10 to the biggest companies in the world, they didn't want it. So, I think the best decision I made was to be very focused, to not listen to the majority of people and to believe in my intuition that it would become as important as it became. And so many of them are building companies that they're thinking, I'm going to raise more money, and I'm going to build this big thing. They're going to get caught making money is always a good idea. You're not a hero by losing money every month. I think that they're wrong, but I think that they're right for them. I've lost tens of thousands of followers through the years because I put out too much content. But I've picked up millions in return. It's like rotation, right? That's right. The end. Okay. Now, there's another thing. There is too much content if you're not good enough. But numbers are saying that we're growing. So, I'd rather look at the numbers than your friend Pedro's opinion. Okay. Okay. But I don't care about the questions. I care about the actions. Like why I like you two is you're doing things. You know, I'm saying things and you're doing. Don't listen to what I'm saying. Watch what I'm doing. Yes, please. Got some of the WHW, right? You know, maybe we just show people's like 30 faces, like maybe five faces in four seconds of like speaking to camera. Got it? I got that. Where? What? You know, like how? I'm sorry. Where? What? How? We show podcast blogs because I actually want you to win. Adrienne said, Gary. Somebody said, Gary V, would you follow yourself if you weren't yourself? I said no. Adrienne said exactly. The more I learn from you, the less I give a shit about you. I love it. True coaching. Stepping up my own game. One day a lot of you will realize it's because I and I'm, jeez, I'm looking and I'm paying attention. I'm in the minority of this because there's very few people building substantial business wealth, selfish things outside of their success of personal brand at this level. You're going to realize one day the difference between me and the far majority of the other people you're giving attention to is I actually want you to win. Not I want to make you feel like I want you to win, but I actually want to win. Pay attention not to what people say, but what they do. Punchline for me is here's what I do. Just really expect nothing from you. We'll give you everything. Sure, occasionally a book, occasionally a sweater. I could care less if you buy any of those things. I just ask. That shit pisses me off. I get all up in you. You actually stop watching me and then you go watch fucking dumb fuckers that have half the fucking value and the eighth of the value. So you feel good because you unfollowed DailyVee or me on Instagram. And then you're going to watch Hucksters. Fucking stupid. Doing means doing. Doing doesn't mean stop watching me and that's the tactic that makes you feel good. Not that you want to unfollow you. I want them to unfollow everybody. By the way, I watch the Jets. It's not that I want them to unfollow me. It's just I want them to do more. More, more, more. That Drake thing was crazy. I will never really know, but it's way too random. Drizzy. Drizzy. And is the other business making money? Yeah. And the car thinks you're passionate? Yeah, it's true. I get it. It's classic. You got to do both. Yeah, I try to. I try to. But it's taking up too much time? Yeah, 80, 20. Yeah, stuff is a lot of I'm doing the filming, editing stuff and took a lot of time. I would try to get an intern then to help you with some of the stuff. Yeah, okay. And even though you're not big yet, you'd be surprised. You live here? Yeah, yeah. There's 5000 kids in Hamburg that are 15 years old that have more talent than you editing. Yeah. That will just think it's cool to edit your YouTube. Okay, I got it. You see where I'm going? Yeah, yeah. So I go to Twitter, I go to YouTube, I go to Instagram and I reach out to people. Okay. Your next video on YouTube? Yeah. Make a video that says, hey, I need a full-time editor intern, but I'm going to make it one day and I'll pay you back. Okay. And one person has to believe you. Got it. Okay. Not bad, right? Yeah, it's a really good idea. It's just, you know, you know what happens? People are scared to have somebody work for them for free because they're good people. I'm scared. I didn't say yes to DRock at first. I'm scared. But if I'm going to do something, I know it's going to be successful. And the best thing that ever happened to DRock was he made a film or two for me for free. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Best thing. 100%. That's the fucking thing, dick. So, you know, so that's it. So let me give you an example. If a 15-year-old edits for you for two years and you don't make it, well then you pay them. Yeah. One day. Yeah. You know, people don't understand, you know, like, life's about trading and then there's a lot of ways to trade. That 15-year-old will get a lot of experience to you both. The 15-year-old will get your alarm to make sure you don't miss me. Okay. You know. Busy glooms, that's sorry. Yeah, we're sorry. We're busy here. Awesome. Thank you. Awesome, man. Take care of yourself. Yeah. Good thing. Take care, my friend. Thank you. Stay well. Take care. Take care. You do an awesome job. I really love it. Thank you so much. Almost that time again. That time the kids love so much. It's piece one. Where's the second piece? It's in here somewhere. Piece two. Hey, kids. It's almost time for airport Gary. With my trusty outfit. You really need to dress it for here. I turn into, you do it. I turn into airport Gary. Humbert, thank you so much. Great event. A lot of good content today. The themes are simple, my friends. You're going to get bored of it eventually. More and more and more. You do do. The actions. Fucking the actions. I want it so bad for you. I want it so bad because I'm selfish. Because I want that feeling of people coming up to me and I can feel in your fucking eye that I'm making your life better. You know how fucking insane that is? Thank you for the ones that are doing and the ones that are putting more time and effort. You're making two people very happy. You and your world and me and my world. You only get to live this life one time. Once. You only get to do it one time. One very smart thing a lot of you youngsters can do is go volunteer at a nursing home one time and go hang out with people that are 70, 80, 90. Like your grandparents, like your great grandparents. The number one thing they'll tell you is they regret the things they didn't do. So try. What are you waiting for? Just because somebody's going to make fun of you on your YouTube video, you're not going to care in 3, 4, 5, 6 years. But what you might have left on the table was the thing that would have changed your life.
