Yeah. If you want it, you gotta do it. Too many people talking, not executing. See, I'm so optimistic, boy, I'm that college day dreamer Just tryna make enough to see myself driving a beamer And see some spitting verses that are hotter than a fever All my music tends to be on the tight end like a receiver I'm heading to face your welcome I'm still passionate I'm just trying to pass my classes But doing that and making music always seems to clash I struggle for my passions Especially when all the artists out here are competing Hard to reach the top of the fast You know, in good old fashions 10 hours in the air for 15 hours of commuting For a one hour talk But Facebook is a platform that we continue to Triple down on and trying to really think a lot more about impact Versus volume this year This one talk, I had a bunch of important meetings 7, 8 different meetings in New York But this one, I feel will have a lot of impact Cause I get in front of a lot of people that I meet too And I get to spark and a gateway drug for us to collect it Now that I'm the office of the CEO, I can scale those opportunities So I'm just trying to be much more strategic about every fucking minute Keepers are scared to always do that They already had to overthink ideas People try to overthink everything That I just came up with, you know, biz dev Here's the key, here's actually, that's it, you nailed it I don't give a fuck if biz devs Sunday's works or not If they'll write at the time, we're gonna execute it right now I'll get some dividends from it Anything from zero to life changing Right? Vayner toys, lost money, Wine Library TV Changed my career, right? Yeah, actually, the more I think about it, like the amount of things that I Vayner toys doesn't work Wine Library TV changes my career Jesus, Jesus, V-Chat didn't work Ask ARV search engine, crush it And could be way bigger, we just haven't done a good job promoting it So yeah, I think the reason most people are losing Is because they're scared of losing That's the punchline I just don't give a crap Just don't care about other people's opinions on my entrepreneurial ventures Everybody else does Just 99% does That'd be awesome Even though it's been a half hour taking the garbage out this morning That's what we do, right? Right I take the garbage out You have to CO takes out the garbage and closes the biggest deal, that's the game You gotta do everything What's your name? Johnny Johnny, thanks man What I'm doing right now in DM is insane Hitting people in DM I think I'm gonna change, I think, listen to this, I'm usually pretty headstrong I think there's been four or five suggestions of calling it crushing it And then leave crushed it for the end I like that I'm probably gonna do that I'm being sold on it I like that better because It's in the middle, yeah Just got a DM from somebody who says, I love your daily V It made me respect where I am in the journey I never ever take any step or victory for granted And just getting my hands dirty It's fun, right? Because a lot of kids think they've made it Or a lot of kids haven't even made it yet And they watch this And they don't take the fucking 15 hour commute for one meeting that they can just teach it And they don't grind And putting in perspective what it takes That has always been my biggest goal with this 60 second club Don't forget to like the photo as well Too many of you just posting We're checking now No cheating, motherfuckers I'm not gonna be here tonight I'm gonna be here tonight You got me feeling it You got me feeling it You got me feeling it Oh boy, they know me This is my song Love it Thank you I'm gonna be here tonight Somebody did their homework That's my jam A couple things to address right away First I wanna thank my mom for that first bio that you read Number two, I don't think I'm provocative at all That would be the basis of my talk I actually think when people say I'm provocative Or futurist or disruptive I genuinely believe that I'm the most practical of all I always start the meeting with my clients Listen, you need to be in the no business Instead of the yes business So when we show you shit You need to say, oh my god, no You can't put b**** tics in the video That's not... That adjective is an on brand Or that color is... This magical on brand shit Is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life It is literally, literally the thing people love the most Because again, it's all they've got I mean, do you know what a brand manager in America looks like? They went to business school They're P&L driven Their most fun is hanging out with you When they get to do the creative thing And the only leverage they have is to say Not funny enough So they play that card It has nothing to do with the reality of business Guys, for every just do it And every MasterCard priceless Tons of all time great pieces of content Hit the cutting room floor Because the creative director came in and said You know what, we only have an hour and a half So instead of four, let's pitch these two He f***ed up That third one would have been it Or they come in with those two And the person picks the other one I mean, it's just not efficient in a 2017 world So yes, if I could get them there And they're scared shitless of this But unlike you guys Where you have to pander to the situation I literally don't give a f*** if we lose the business I mean it, like the only reason we've been able to cut through Is I'm like, cool, see ya Like, I don't know, like we have to do it our way There's no ROI positive for me to f***ing Do it the other way Nobody watches a f***ing television commercial Nobody on earth Like, when are we going to put common sense into the equation The best deal in the world in marketing The Super Bowl ad, because it is event viewing The worst deal, whether it's the Oscars or Grammys I don't even pay attention I don't even allow myself to spend one second To do this homework Because it means nothing for my future But whatever the second most expensive commercial is Let's call it the Oscar or the Grammys The worst deal in advertising Nobody's watching a commercial during the Oscars It's not event driven watching Everybody is commenting on the person's dress We lack common sense in our industry Bless you We lack common sense in this industry We lack common sense in this industry The end The end The end Here's what I know And this is what pisses me off I go and do these things I go to Cannes I get on, I'm part of a panel With the creative director of this horseshit And the creative director of that horseshit And the creative director of this horseshit I do my thing They all team up with bullshit data And then that's it Then we go to the Carlton At three o'clock in the morning and drink rosé And you pump them with a couple of bottles of rosé And then they come over and be like You're right I promise you this one thing If people's lives depended on it The way I marketed for my family business And I had to feed my family If people's lives depended on these decisions They wouldn't be doing what they're doing I really appreciate the work you guys are doing I hope I get to cross paths with a bunch of you Okay Alright, that was successful Now back to the airport 215?
