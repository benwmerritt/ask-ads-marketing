Time to uh... buzz this shit. It's the best buzz of the year. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? You had a good break? Yeah. Really, really good. Really good. No wide library or bigger media, you know? Yeah. Where all the stress has went down. All just went around and stuff, you know? Can't be busy in front of a supermarket. Yeah. When you have taken over with Gary, what has been your main focus? We've actually gone through a bunch of different focuses throughout. The main thing, number one, was helping him feel really good. That was from day one to now. The most important thing is making sure he feels really good. No pain. So we've improved his soft tissue quality all over, especially in his hips and his legs. And then now, also in addition to that, we just want to stack on some muscle for the next couple months before we do start doing a little bit of a summer cut. Summer cut means I'm going to lose 15 pounds, but all the muscle is going to be there D-Rock. And that means shirtless keynotes. Good. We're working up to a top set of sets, so we'll see how everything goes. Camera on. Let's come on. Shine. See how shy I am in real life. How many days a week do you work out? Seven days a week. And are they all weight lifting? No, no. So about four days a week are heavy strength work. And then three days a week are quality mobility. But if we can play ball, hopefully ball we haven't done in a while. So, you're covering a lot of soft tissues, huh? It probably gives me the audacity to give the business advice that I give. It's the fact that I've figured out this world. This did not come natural to me. There's fat Gary keynotes cut in right now, Tyler. And you have to do it, right? Like, it's like exercise, right? Like this book and what I just told you is right. Right? But so is the way to get a six pack in your stomach, right? Right way to get a six pack for your stomach. There's exercises, right? And there's a diet. I know what they are. I'm not doing it. Like, my, Steve, I wonder if my business advice was real. Was it completely hard wired? Was that just completely talented and others would try but they'd have no chance. But just making that switch of going all in, not doing tactics. That's D-Rock. Has he been working out? Yeah. I said no. Because you're not unless you completely go black and white. That's it. Everybody in our circles, you know? Friends and family, they're not. They might be that moment but just ask them another week later. Everybody's making New Year's resolutions right now. But I can't wait. I can't mark the date D-Rock. As soon as I'm done with this rant, put on your calendar. February 19th. I'm going to make a video. I'm going to be like, it's your February 19th resolution. How's your New Year's one going? I know how it's going. Not well. So you've got to make the binary switch. If you can make that binary switch, you'll be like, I'm going to work a lot. I'm not going to have excuses anymore. I'm going to be very patient. I'm going to learn how to build a business. Then things can happen. Just like I made the switch here forever. Seven days a week for life. That was all just to buy an extra minute of rest. But at the top, I want you to pause for a second. Pause the top. I was at the gym. I was just looking at the top. At whatever it was doing. It was like, kind of like a normal gym. Just like 30, 35, maybe 40. They're people who go to the gym every day and do the same thing over and over again. Maybe they're texting between sets. They're pretty consistent people. It's like... That's a lot of makeup work. You don't do anything until 38. You've got to make it up. It's another good segue. It is. It's like, if you're 41, you're going to have to be more extreme than if you're 17. It's patterned. It's learning from patterns. It's getting used to your team. If you've been doing something for 40 years, unsuccessfully, you've got to completely do it differently. So I'm pushing it harder because I deserve to pay the price. Those people doing 30s, they've been doing it every day for 15 years. They can be okay. I've got to go to 50s because I got more time to make up. One more. So you work out right, Duran? Yup. When you work out? And then I go. What? Like we're doing a lot? Yeah. Getting all those calories worth up? Yeah. And the stronger you get, the more essentially we're going to be doing. I'm thinking analogy actually. That's what? The longer you get, the more you're going to be doing. That's right. The reason I can work 17 hours a day now is because I put in the work at 8 hours a day, 10 hours a day, 12 hours a day. You can't go from zero sitting around being lazy to, oh, I saw Gary V quote on the Instagram and I'm going to work 18 hours a day. You can't. You can't. He's too much of a shock. You can't do that to each other. You can't for maybe two days a week. You've got to find your own rules. Everybody's different. You can. I've done things in working out that you shouldn't have been able to right away. Right. For sure. You've got to know yourself. Self-awareness. Good workout. Bloody day today. Kind of like half on, half off. Yeah. Half off. I'm going to be in a little bit. In our sports meeting. In our capital of Phil. I can go back in Milka. One more time with the fan before we go to serious pain tomorrow. Pain is slang term for awesome execution. Shit, thank you. Yeah. Stop, man. Thank you. See you guys in a little bit. Yep. Time to uh, buzz this shit. It's the best buzz of the year. There we go. So time to get my hair cut. Got the workout in. Fresh cut for the year. Really excited. Super excited about everybody. Hey, be up in a sec. Super excited about everybody flipping stuff. We've got to talk about that before the end of the day. So cool. How are you? Good to see you. How much are you? I'm going to pay for it. This hair cut might be a bit of a bad thing. Look at all this shit. You're not going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. Look at this. Shit. I'm going to sell it. Sell shit. Need a hammer? Here it is. Do you know what's this hammer go for? $29. Yeah. $7.99. Better than zero. Especially when you don't have it. You know? Yeah. How much will a DRock go for? That's a good stuff. This thing's so fucking awesome. Yeah, two hammers. $14. Where's the other hammer? Fuck, two hammers. $14. Actually, this one was like over $9. $6. Anyway. Alright guys. Going to get ready for this meeting. Love you. And just remember, everybody's got a price. Right, right, Evan. I have this really interesting 2017 challenge. It is my belief that everybody has a ton of chachicas, ton of former, like closed, ton of electronics, I'm trying to find my iPhone, but different generation iPhones. I'm about to send a tweet with, give me an update on your eBay flip stories. Give a context. I know tweets only have 140 characters, but like maybe a picture of your eBay account or of the sold item. DRock is about to make a three to four minute, you know, eBay testimonial kind of like blueprint. Like what am I actually talking about? I'm creating a $21,700 challenge. I believe that everybody, if they convert, you know, 210 hours into hustling and flipping stuff, we'll be able to, by the end of the year, amass $21,000 in profit for their account. So I'm about to send a tweet, go to Twitter and reply to it. Love you. See ya. Ha ha. That's intimidating. Uh, logistics. You want to be self-deprecating, hard on the thing that they perceive, because you're not going to convince them to pass by. You haven't seen it for me. I might even take you guys to a VaynerMedia meeting where you see me play self-deprecation because you don't understand my strategy around it, because in these meetings, it's the marketing, super confident football, self-defeat. You might be thinking, I'm asking you to do that. I just don't think you fight the decision maker. I never fight the decision maker. Like so when they say to me, you guys don't do television, like we don't do television. 100% Do you have a story about Chester? I got a video in the house. That was great. Alright, going to go back and sneak some family time in before we go really, really full-time today, but go and end out some quality stuff, good meeting on Vayner Capital. A lot of people forget the Gary Vee thing as my side hustle. Venture Capital, sports agency, media agency, wine shop, plenty busy, but this felt good. It's good to get back on the grind, D-Record to see you. Tyler, good to see you. What's it going? And a CBay video should be good, and appreciate all the love on Instagram. Been really into it. It's really hard to call right now. A lot of engagement. Really gotten the community engagement on the DMs and comments down. So it's been cool. See you tomorrow. Well, something just popped up for Vayner Sports. It's a busy time for us. So now I'm headed back out. I have to put the kids to bed and hustling some more. You know, you either put in the work or you don't.
