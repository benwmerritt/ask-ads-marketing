One music video for the next year for the next year Six months. No the next year. I'm gonna have a baby things are gonna happen Yeah, how to fucking baby I've been telling you I'm being an especial my specialty I'm putting in the work tell him dirt in the earth I'm moving furniture to heaven Well or their subjective call on creative instead of creating the process that allows more creative to see the day of light I'm able to see the quant and qual feedback from it So it's the human beings in the way of letting more creative see the world and then reacting to the creative Instead of having the ego that would be individuals that pick the creative You know that I'm flying You know that I'm trying I can't even Can't be your mentor Phil I know it's so Like if I'm on your team, I'm all the way there I just I just stopped like the the faucet of like awesomeness and love and opportunity It's just off and it's just like that you've seen a lot It's a tortoise in the head right don't even don't even don't even it's just don't deflect that you're killing it You entertain me for three or four times a fucking day. Excuse my language Excuse my language You're not being for God's sake, but you you told me that you sat me down in a room when I first met you And I had known you for about five minutes and you said You're gonna have a million followers this time next year and I laughed I remember and you said no you're going to you were like What the fuck doesn't this kid get you're like everybody's going to I Know you didn't quite mean that but like what do you mean? I didn't mean it When we were in 315 and I was just building out that office I knew exactly I told all of you fuckers what you were gonna Make so to me. Let's take a step back sure instead of what you're doing right now one man's point of view in Trying to win in a way that I think you have less control sure and The majority of people are trying to go through that path sure My question is do you believe that you can replicate? Your social reach If you Decided to create for musically decided to create for Instagram create for the platform Not create the romantic thing you've decided that you are You can replicate it if you choose. That's the right move only thing I'm doing for you because I love you is giving you the permission To understand that truth I get it. What's plan B? Plan B is to be like everybody else in this town and fucking be at the mercy of Organizations that don't give a fuck about you That's plan B motherfucker, that's great What a horrifying reality be you've painted for me. That's plan B. I gotta tell you something Yes, sir my dad's first-generation Greek and I think that's why I love you because this is this is like my father talking Except you're way younger than my dad For the next year for the next year Six months no the next year. I'm gonna have a baby things are gonna happen Yeah, how to fucking baby Most you want to know what's most interesting about that moment what you're so good at what you did and what you do I was able to give it that stop that's that was actually an incredible moment. I consume no content I know I'm not really like I know that's it the fact that you have something like that. I'm not gonna let you fucking waste it Plug it on this what the fuck do you think this whole episode is gonna be about so for the next 365 days This man right here is going to be making a song a day on Instagram Who's freaking the fuck out I can't curse on this channel you can curse fuck.

Peace peace out Peace All right guys Don't guys I'm fucking fired up You're like excited about the content you're excited about you're excited about bananas fit in circles Which is gonna be huge hit, but don't mentors have more experience and connections. Yes But if you do work like and what people don't understand that really pisses me off is They're not creating any leverage Everything's about fucking leverage But look at you two fucking jerk offs you guys had leverage because you came to work for free That was your leverage that created your opportunity people fucking hitting up people on DM like hey more Cuban I want to be I want you to be my mentor with what fucking leverage asshole So either you go and do it from scratch and build something that gives you leverage like if fucking young Mark Zuckerberg Or young and miss Beagle wants to hit me up and says hey, I'm like yeah Hey, you built something you've got something or You fucking do something that brings disproportionate value to the other person which is the only thing is free work of a skill that people need But then everybody cries it goes I don't do spec work That's the value of me everybody you know like ridiculous argument because the value of you is your whole life not fucking six weeks six months or a year Nobody understands this is all leverage It's all leverage people don't want to work man people don't want to work. I know you agree you did it I Feel who'd you get into Forbes under 30 under 30 or whatever fucking list you're on you know like There's no fucking way you were gonna do it other than did something smart like yet you did something smart and rogue You did something even more interesting not only did you you did two things right you asked most people don't even fucking ask and You a crow like You did you ask twice You asked more than twice you need to dig up those emails That's a real fucking blog post You need to find every one of them do you rock you have enormous lots of downtime I wish you well brother I Want to do it I want to do a 24 hour Q&A live globally, right?
