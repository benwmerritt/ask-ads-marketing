How you doing? Good to see you Okay, Rose We about to do this What's the name of the podcast? The Journal Ryan did it? I saw a picture of him What? Oh yeah, Hoover, yeah He did it D-rock, what are you doing? Living life Alright, let's get started Gary V It's good to be here man Why VaynerMedia? What made you think that? Well, I think you remember this I think it's actually more interesting to ask you I don't know if you'll remember I don't know if it's enough of a moment for you to remember It's a long time ago, but I thought everybody Our whole crew, Saka, Moran, Travis Everybody was weirded out that AJ and I started VaynerMedia Because everybody was building big tech apps and raising tons of money Actually, I wasn't weirded out by it at all Because you're practical, to that point You're practical What I knew was I was building a foundation for my future It wasn't hard for me The first 13 years of my life weren't sexy I was quiet and I built an actual business But how did you get funding? No, we landed a Gillette project for $80,000 We activated a Vegas Travis Fluent and slept on our floor with me and AJ I met this dude at a Nets game who had an agency It was a subcontracted thing and he's like, hey You're starting, I was like What are you doing? You're the wine guy I was like, what are you doing? You were getting some popularity And I was writing Crush It This started in May of 2009 So I just finished writing that And I just gave... No, and I just gave that Web 2.0 talk Everybody has time Stop watching Fucking Lost That blew my whole world up That was the moment There's two moments Being on Dignation with you and Alex 100% You guys are in press mode with your little Madonna talk Why did you get to... That combo, and they were 3 or 4 months apart really put me in a place What are people having a hard time figuring out that you wish you could just really tell people this is what you need to succeed I mean, people are looking to you for that thing to tip them over Permission Is it permission? It's permission People are scared to fail That's crazy I was about to say the one thing you and I have in common is that you are so not scared to We'll all die We'll all be dust in like 30 years I better not die in 30 years Jesus Christ, this guy 50's better I'm just saying, why not man Why not give it your all and just go crazy Because people care what other people think Who cares? Everybody's going to fail You're going to fail Everywhere we look around us people are going to fail at trying new things Thanks man, thank you brother I love you That was fun Get together and just kind of shoot the shit You know, like I feel like it's a... I feel like I'm doing a lot of one on ones and I still haven't really put I was thinking about it today without even remembering that we were doing this today Like when are we going to do the town hall thing But even if I can finally figure my shit out and do the town hall thing I want to do more of these 15, 20's, I just don't think I think what's holding me back is I just don't see how we're going to get to anything real with 700 people You know, tough to ask those questions that you really want to answer from But I'm trying to figure out how to scale a little bit because people are not... I mean when I look around the room here and think about how little time I've had with some of you like, that's exactly why I'm here I think my style of building businesses is to establish kindness and culture first So I think about it like parenting I think you parent your kids in the first three or four years and most of you or some of you will get this opportunity Misha is perfectly aligned with the age of this company. They were literally born the same month Right? We expect a little more from Misha than we do from Xander because she's seven and he's four Do you think if you didn't get successful you got with Angel Investing? Would you have done things differently? No, because it's how I built Wine Library Nothing But timing wise, do you think you'd be able to do a lot of the giving back that you're doing now at this scale? Yeah, it's the thing that I did It's how I built Wine Library I'm just patient Like what's everybody in a rush for? Like I promise you if I asked everybody, hey do you want to make $10 million in three years or do you want to make $50 million in 11? Some people would take the 10 and 3 That's fine But I don't know I like the 15 and 11 It's just better I think people get confused and unfortunately I didn't document this at the time So here's something interesting I was about to say I think people get confused because I wasn't documenting my life and thoughts when I was actually being patient in my 20s and now they see it What I don't think people realize is I'm nothing compared to what I'm going to be So when I'm going to be the guy Like the Not nice cold status amongst the smart homies Then this is going to be interesting This is going to be real interesting when you know when I sell a company for $1.7 billion This is going to be really interesting when I buy a brand and flip it This is going to be really interesting when I make my I have another Facebook and Uber in me I'm going to put $5 million into it at a $10 million valuation and then This is going to be interesting in 25 years One of the things I thought I've been in the tech world for all my career but I have a lot of friends that always ask whether or not I would start my own thing including my former CEO Do you have any confidence in your content? It's funny because my answer was always No I think I'm a very And until you said it in your content I think it really stuck with me I'm a very good number 2 I get it man I love being like that So I'm going to say something that pisses me off that DRock is catching this I've sat here and there but I don't think I'm going to be escaping this one I secretly wish I was a number 2 It's the best job You get a lot of the economics a lot You get a lot a lot a lot of the perks and a lot less of the shit You're still number 2 When you're number 1 you're a professional janitor When you're number 1 you're in the shittiest spot ever It devastates me that my hard wiring forced me into the narrative I'm obsessed with number 2 It's the gig It's the gig It's just great You still can impact You can do so much and there's still something about not being the last line of defense You still get to look at somebody else and go And for me the way I am theoretically I wish I was a number 2 but for me it's so funny even though I just made that huge rant I could never look at somebody and say what am I going to do It's funny but it's a good gig and I think even more interestingly I think number 3 and 4 and 5 If you can be impactful there's people in my company that are number 57 but have a lot of influence and that's a really great gig That's That's right Yes, that's right It's a 52 at Facebook They're growing landings Oh my god From a financial standpoint, number 52 at Facebook is going to make more than 99.9% of number 1s That's why I always remind people that interact with me This is where I think B-Rock is very smart watching his whole narrative like You gotta be smart when you catch a tiger by the tail You really do She was just told you want to say no to a seat on the rocker ship I think it's like Yeah, right You just take whichever seat is given to you And I love the meritocracy of it all The people that jump off my ship I'm such a son of a bitch when it comes to the competitive nature of business I love them and I feel sad and I want nothing but great and I genuinely genuinely genuinely wish they go on and do bigger than if they stayed with me I really do however I'm excited to knowing that that's probably not going to be the case and I can't wait to see them That's why I love business because you can be a good guy and you can be an assassin at the same time and if you know how to balance it you can really pull it off I should be down like 20 30 I'm going to take the mic off for now
