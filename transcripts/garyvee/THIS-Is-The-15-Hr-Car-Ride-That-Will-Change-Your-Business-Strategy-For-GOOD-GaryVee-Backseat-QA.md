A sheer amount of people that started DM to me of like, I used to make fun of you. I didn't believe a word you said. So I hit me up this weekend. Who's basically apologizing. He's like, when I would get really drunk, I would lash out on you publicly because you were everything that I wasn't. People do not understand the power of envy and jealousy. It is destroying people. So this 22 year old wants to be successful fast. What do I say to this person? Calm the f*** down. Hey everybody, welcome to the first ever backseat Q&A. I've done some backseat Q&As in the past. Heck, half of daily B was backseat Q&A, but like a sit down two and a half hour. F***. Backseat Q&A. I'll probably have to do some phone calls or have some emergencies along the way. That's just the nature of my life. Dustin McKenzie on the team are here and away we go. I'm ready. We have Andrea. How do you deal with toxic coworkers or family culture? Like if I have to be nearby someone, I'm related to, for example, you own a restaurant together. How do you deal if they're just really difficult? Family businesses are hard. You know, like I lived in it. I live in it. Like my core business partner so my whole life or my dad and my brother, AJ. So first and foremost, this is my number one piece of advice with family businesses, which is you're in charge. Meaning whoever you are, the dad, the mom, the grandfather, the grandma, the niece, the nephew, the son-in-law, the brother-in-law, the oldest, the youngest, the middle. Life is about accountability. And how would I deal with it? Either you eat it because you're a C player and you're getting paid like a B player or A player because you're living a netbo life. You pointed me. No, I didn't point you. You're not. I'm just touching your leg because I'm, you know how it roll, Eastern European. Let's break this down. There are certain people that are about to listen to this that are the netbo baby. Meaning they're the kid, the grand kid, and you're getting super compensated. Even though you're just okay, you're just average, and you're getting over compensated and you just need to eat it. You need to eat it. Like how do you deal with it? By realizing you're a netbo baby and you're getting paid four times more than you're worth on the open market. And if grandma, grandad, uncle, niece, nephew, brother are shitting on you and you're hating it, you just decide to eat it because you're accepting the dollar amount versus the day-to-day happiness. Number two, you're not the netbo baby. And you feel undervalued. You know, I lived this life. Like I was building it and felt that there was undervalued. I had the ability to do what I did. I left. A lot of people are gonna say, well, I put in all this time and did it. No crying in baseball, no crying in business. So how do you deal with this? One, you're self-aware enough and you eat it and you have therapy and other outlets to make it palpable. B, you realize that nobody's crying for you and you can just leave the end. And I don't want the excuses. You know how I talk about perfection as an excuse for insecurity? I don't wanna hear like, but my grandma, but I don't wanna, my family, no, no, no. If you don't fucking love it, if it's eating you up alive, if you're dead, then you go and address it and you address it by action. So you either eat it because you're a netbo baby or you leave because you're capable of standing on your own two feet outside of the family business dynamic. That is the answer to the question. You have Emma. Emma. Advice for a first-time leader in a first-time manager role in a company that's growing fast, but it's been chaotic since starting. The reason most first-time leaders fail is that they really struggle with the new-found power or they really struggle with the new-found obligation to be a delegator and a manager and a doer, not just a doer. So many people will go through the journey of being great at their job, be promoted to a manager where now they need to lead people to do that job well at scale and they will fail because they're a good doer but a bad manager because they either micro-manage and don't delegate so the efficiency for the business is not there, meaning if I get paid 80K to do a job, 50K. Now I'm paid 90K to manage 350Kers. If I'm not doing the manager part of 90 and I'm just working with the 50Kers, the 3150 that's all in, my 90, if it acts like in down there at 240, you're not getting the value because we're really getting a buck 50 of value because now four of us are doing the job of three and there's friction and you guys know this, people tripping all over each other. So you have to be a 90 up here that makes the whole thing worth 240 and then some if you're a good manager, getting value out of those 50s. So one, if you're a micro-manager, that's not gonna work. Two, a lot of people think they've become somebody. They had a bad manager when they were down in the 50 land. They shit on that manager, they go out for drinks with their coworkers and they're like fucking Sally and Rick or assholes, right? And then they become the asshole. They're an enormous amount of employees who hate their fucking managers, who then when they become a manager, replicate the toxic bad behavior because subconsciously or consciously, they're just reenacting that bad behavior. The hypocrisy of employee becoming manager to only then become exactly what the manager was is like at scale. I've seen in my organizations. Go ahead, Mackenzie. Why do you think that happens? Because I think people are hypocrites. I think people are not self-aware. I think people are insecure. I think people are not empathetic. So they become a manager and now all of a sudden they're like, oh shit, my manager, same shit as parenting. So many people listening and watching right now made all sorts of jokes about their parents. Then they become parents, especially as you become a little bit of an older parent. The cliche one is, and I have so many friends in this era now, is we all remember the shit we talked about our parents when we were in high school. That you remember. You don't remember when you're two. Well then when you have kids that are in high school, you're like, oh shit, same with this manager thing. There's a million people that are gonna listen to this video or audio over the next decade. That will happen. Of those million people, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands have all sorts of opinions on their boss. When they become that boss, they're gonna realize shit's different. What is my advice? Couple things. One, you need to be the bigger person in every situation. This is your employee. This is you need to work for them, not them working for you. You thinking like now you're like the fucking prince or the princess and everyone caters around you and you don't do shit is the fastest way to get fired. Happens all the time by the way. Happens all the time. Everybody's been eating shit to get that moment to point. So first you work for them. Two, over communicate. Over communicate to the people that work for you. How are you doing? What's up? This and that. Over communicate. Over communicate. Over communicate. Number three, attack issues. If you see Johnny is like moping this week and has always been cheery, go in it. It's an HR function more than anything else. Number three, make sure your boss is aware of how you're managing. Make sure your boss knows like I'm in these people's feelings. These 10 people that now report to me, these three people that know report to me. I care about how they feel because I was just them a week ago and I know what's happening in the trenches. Boss, this is what's going on. This is what I'm thinking. This is how we fix it. Number five, notice the question in a high pass chaotic place. This is my biggest strength. This is why I think I got to the top. You take pressure from above you, your boss, your new boss, because you're now a new manager and you stop it at your level. Your new boss comes to you and says, you know, you're a middle manager. Now an upper middle manager comes to you and says, oh fuck, if we don't hit these numbers, everyone's getting fired. You don't take anxiety and fear and just take it from you and then pass it down to your homies. It stops with you and you may say, but wait a minute, shouldn't the boss be above me? Good at that? Yeah, they should have, but they might not. There's a lot of people in VaynerX right now that are better managers than the manager above them. It's a human game. Everyone treats shit different. And so you must stop the chaos at your level and make people underneath you feel calm and your anxiety and your concerns and your franticness must go above you or parallel to you and not seep underneath you. The most vulnerable, the most junior in a company, get the most spun up by a layoff, by a new competitor in the market, by the CEO crack, it's just the same old thing. Less experience, more spun up. What do you mean by spun up? Spun up means sent into a tizzy and concern. Like we hired 80 new people in one office recently and we fired two people and everyone's like, everyone's getting fired. I'm like, we hired 80 people. But like for you two, you'd be like, you're in your career now a little bit. You're like, okay. But for someone six months out of college, if the two people that were fired were their friends after work or their boss, they're like, ah, they don't see the forest for the trees. Got it? So that's what I would say for a new manager. Stop the chaos at your level. You work for them. Kevin F. Kevin. If you're trying to take your side hustle full time and only have three hours a day to work on it, that's literally it. Would you still suggest working on marketing activities versus sales? The thought is that if I focused 90% of my time on sales, I'd be able to go full time and then have hours to create content, brand, et cetera. I'm cool with that. He's saying, if I work on sales, I'll get to monies quicker that will allow me to then do marketing. I'm cool with that. None of my advice is universal. That's actually a tremendous thing to say in this. I'm glad it came up early. A lot of my advice is like valid to 78%, 91%, 83%. I'm trying to go in the margins. Now, the stuff I talk about emotionally, not tactically, we're now talking marketing with Kevin. The emotional stuff, like don't be insecure. That's a hundred. So don't use what I just said to be like, oh cool, I can be fucking, I can use perfection as an excuse for, I can be a dick, like no. But the tactical shit. Marketing is better than sales because it's sales that come to you. His circumstance, that's the macro, that's 80%. In this scenario, Kevin needs to get to that paper to be able to leave his job, to be able to go into content. Yeah, I'm cool with that. That being said, for Kevin included one post on TikTok and one post on LinkedIn could go viral and outflank everything he's doing in sales. That being said, it's more practical. It sounds like for him to go ham on sales, get that money up, and allows him to jump and start. And then, by the way, he probably has to double down on sales that first year to solidify it, to make it stable, and then he can go into marketing. Probably that's what I did with VaynerMedia. I wasn't making content for VaynerMedia in 2009, 2010, 11. I was doing sales. I wasn't really doing content until the AskGaryVee Show in 14. I was doing one every TV up until 11. I was at my age 12 and 13, and I came back in 14 with AskGaryVee Show, and then we got to cook it. Now I'm also zeroing in on one thing. Me doing marketing, Wine Library TV, and doing Twitter and Facebook, is why I was able to sell. So I started with marketing. Then I did sales. Then I went back to marketing. Got it? So if I didn't have Wine Library TV and had a million followers on Twitter, none of the Campbell Super, the NHL, or GE, or PepsiCo would have hired me. So it's a little bit, you know? Saf says, Saf? Saf, what advice would you give to a fresh university graduate who's pressured about financial success? To calm the fuck down. What do you mean pressure for financial success? For financial success? Not even, heck, I was about to be nicer. Not even financial like getting by in life. Let's break this down. When you were 22 years old, your optionality is bananas. It's actually remarkable. Your life is so good compared to someone who's 40 or 38. You have so many options. If you're 39 and you have two children, then you're at home, and your shit's hitting the fan. You just save money, and you decide to move in with your parents, that shit is tough. That's a tough pill to swallow. The level of humility that is required to be a 38-year-old who's listening or watching right now. She or he is the breadwinner to the home. Or maybe they're both working parents, which is so common now. And you look at each other's face, and you're like, we need to sell our home. Or we need to stop paying rent in our townhouse or apartment. And we need to go live with one of our parents to reset. And our 11 and 13-year-old are gonna know it. We may even have to leave the school district. And we have a 14-year-old teenager who's gonna ask us why? Then we're gonna say that we just lived above our means, our cash flows tight, or what's going on right now. As we sit here right now, the stock market is melting. People are losing jobs. People are losing money. Like shit's hitting the fan. By the way, all my contents about the hits so heavy the last six years, because we've been in prosperity. Everybody's been crying about dumb shit, about extra luxuries. People are gonna be crying about not having necessities in a minute. Like real talk. If you're a 39-year-old right now, and you have to move back in with your parents, with your family, fuck that hurts. The judgment, the fucking, like the explaining to your children. You're 22? You can live at home. Nobody's got anything to say. You can live with five. I mean, when you're 22 years old, you can actually live in a shithole with six homies, and it's fun-ish, depending on how you're wired. Fun for me, I get some people rebouging, and they're like, eh, but like, gotta share a shower. But like, you can fucking do that. Like, this is highly not recommended. I don't want Mona to beat me up. But at 22, your body's just in a place where you can eat like shit, which means you could buy 99 cent fucking meals. You got no fucking stress, and the only stress you actually got is ideology or delusion. Like, deep in security of keeping up with the Joneses. Like, I had a combo kid. I was doing this combo, and the kid's like, yeah, but Mark suckered. I was like, what? Dude was, yeah, but Mark suckered in 20. I'm like, bro, you're not Mark suckered. You're not Mark suckered. Most of you are not me. And guess what? Good for you, and who gives a fuck? Like, what are we talking about here? Financial success? I surely didn't have any until my late 30s. You had vision of what you wanted. I had vision of what I wanted. I had skills. I had patience. That's the one I had. Like, yes, I had talent. I had skills. I had a vision. But most of all, I had patience, and an unwavering, like an urchin. Be friends, pop that up. Unwavering urchin, one of my favorites. Sea urchin. I had unwavering, non-givings of fuck about what you, Dustin, Mona, Avi, my parents, the world, and Jackpence47 in the comments had to say about me and my journey. I had no judgment on anybody else's journey, which is the key to the whole thing. I had no gives a fuck about what people thought about what I was doing. In fact, and I've said this, and both of you have heard this, you're my content, people made fun of me in my friend group. I ain't working at your dad's store. When I was 26, 27, you've heard the story of some of my homies going to Wall Street, making a little paper, BMWs, me carrying out case systems. I say this a lot. I talk a lot about a lot of things, and people intake it, but I don't think they believe it. In the way that you both know I work, you two know. You two know I work. They hear it, but they don't know it the way you know. It's the same way that you guys hear me saying, I was 28 years old, and I was carrying a case of liquor out to my friend's car, and I saw pity in a human's eye. Like, you guys don't know that like that. They definitely don't know like that, but I do. And I gave no fucks, because I knew where I was going, because I was patient. Almost everybody wants it fast, wants financials. Almost everybody, almost everybody on earth wants financial success in their 20s to prove it to others, not themselves. I play for me, you play for we. I play for me, and all of you play for them, not even we, because we is including me. Almost all of you play for fucking them. I play for me. And so, what do I say to this person? Come the fuck down. Close your fucking ears. Don't listen to the world. Definitely not your parents. Definitely not society. Definitely not your friends. Nobody. This is your fucking life. You're either gonna realize this at 90, or you're gonna realize it right now. Literally all I'm doing is speeding. In a world where I hate speeding shit up, all I'm doing is speeding people's wisdom of actual life up. You're gonna either hear me now, or hear me in a moment of despair, or hear me in a moment of prosperity, or hear me in a moment of just living life. You're gonna hear me at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. Just a sheer amount of people that started DM to me of like, I used to make fun of you. I didn't believe a word you said. Like, now I'm 42 and I like this. Boom. So, I'm gonna hit me up this weekend. I was an alcoholic. Like, he was telling me in an email, as if I'd seen all his comments on social, I had it, because you know how I roll. Like this, fingers and ears. Go, don't hear you. Piece of shit, don't hear you. But this dude wrote me an email over the weekend, who was basically apologizing that he's been shitting on me. He's like, when I would get really drunk, I would lash out on you publicly, because you were everything that I wasn't. People do not understand the power of envy and jealousy. It is destroying people. It is destroying people. So this 22 year old wants to be successful fast. Just like every other 22 year old. I get it. I want it to be successful, slow. That's so like. How did you know to go fast and be bad? I didn't know fast would be bad. I knew that fast is shortcuts. I know fast is gambling. Look, let's break it back since we got time. My obsession was to build something for my parents. I didn't see anything else. In the same way that most people that wanted fast, let me give you dudes, because I really know these motherfuckers. In the same way that a 23 year old that's watching right now wants it fast, because he wants to use it to flex, to hook up, and to be the envy of his boys, and to prove it to his mom or dad who didn't think they could. One of those three. In the same way they're obsessed right now, fast. My version of that was, I'm gonna do this for my parents, because my parents did right by me. And why did I have that? Because I got lucky with DNA, and I got lucky with circumstance. Not everybody's an immigrant. Not everybody was born in the old country. Not everybody remembers the struggles that we went through. Not everybody had a mom that fucking deserved it. Not everybody had a dad that worked every minute of his life. And I was already at a point in my life where I didn't resent him. I appreciated him. I was born with wisdom. Not every kid wants to hang out with 90 year olds in their five, six, seven like I did. I am who I am. A lot of good with that, a lot of shortcomings with that. But that's me. That's what I was upset. So I didn't know that fast was bad, but I know fast is bad now, because kids gamble. I don't mean like actual gambling. I mean going with crazy idea startups, raising money from all their, if they're wealthy and connected from their rich friends and goes to zero. If they're not, like they blame that they can't get funding and everything's just like the system's rigged. Everyone wants to say the system's rigged when it's not going their way. But when it's going their way and they fuck up, is the system rigged? When all these motherfuckers took the $2,000 check from the government that we printed for COVID, when we fucking are printing cash that is not grounded in anything and they took those $2,000 and bought fucking Nikes and a Dom P bottle? Is the system rigged? Anyway, I didn't know that fast was bad. I had in my 50th year being alive. As I turned 50 in November, I definitely know fast is bad for most people now. Look, some people are all time remarkable and catch a perfect moment in time. Mark Zuckerberg is all time remarkable and caught a perfect moment in time. If Mark was born 30 years earlier, he might just have a successful scale dentistry company because his dad was a dentist. He's just a good entrepreneur who happened to come at the right time. If Friendster wasn't invented, if MySpace wasn't invented, Mark might have not built Facebook. All of that, me included, will tell you that timing is a huge part of this, but you have to be good enough to take advantage of your timing. Cable television, I would have crushed. I would have known that cable was the internet. I would be the king of cable. Virtual influencers now, if I was 18, I'd have the biggest virtual influencer agency. I'd be building it right now. I'd be building right now if I was in different. If I was 19, I would be building the largest virtual influencer agency in the world. What's fun about this two and a half hours, I can go so deep. This is not T with Gary Vee. This is probably gonna be the legacy of the vaccine Q and A format. I can go deep. I actually feel like I leave 10 to 15 to 20% off of every answer because of timing. I'm even talking myself into going deeper on these next follow up questions, but the 22 year old that wants to be successful fast is in these foundational bricks. They are doing it for everyone else because if you're doing it for yourself, you're more guaranteed to get successful, slow. That's it. Actually, I'm so happy. I got it. There it is. When you wanna do it to impress everyone else, whether it's noble, your parents, whether it's deeply toxic, your parents again, your parents both thought you were losers, that's gonna make someone wanna win. I was the reverse. Your parents think you're the best. You wanna help them, right? Cliche for guys, the opposite sex, have fun. That's what guys see. They're like, I wanna take a private jet with a 10 and go to St. Bart's. I know, with a million dollar, they want that life. They don't realize, sure, that's great, but is it soulful? Is it deep? Why are so many people that have that life miserable as fuck? Drug addicts, suicidal. Sounds like it's not guaranteed. Do it the right way. If you do it for them, you want it fast. If you do it for yourself, you want it slow. I think the reason I'm not flashy is very similar to the reason I was willing to do what I did from 22 to 34. I just don't do shit for them. Not for their validation, for their benefit. People sometimes are like, what do you mean you do everything? You're so public. I'm like, look, I'm not looking for their accolades. At least not for what I've done. I'm looking for the accolades of what I've done for them that they then did for themselves. That feels real. I don't want you to admire me for my companies. I want you to admire me because I really gave you something that you did it with that. And now you're happy and you're thankful. Right, Mo? When we were, this weekend, we were at that diner, went at that restaurant for brunch and that lady came to me and she was like, I don't want to interrupt you. We had a family thing going on. She's like, but you had a real impact on me and my husband. And then she saw, she was like, I didn't get into it, I was family time. I wasn't gonna, but like, I just think there's a lot of incredible people listening and watching right now who with a couple of tweaks can live a better life by impacting people in a positive way which then will come back to them in a positive way. And I believe more people are capable of doing what I do and it's in them, but they get straight away and they go to the dark side. And I want to be Yoda to everyone's emperor. If you're putting out cheap shit, you're gonna have cheap fans, you have cheap interactions. And it's gonna not last long. Have one here. It's a bit full on. It's full on. Yeah. Okay. You want to go there. I want to go there. Okay. So no name, but the username is. No name. Yeah. Oh, it's a full on. It's term McGirt. Term McGirt. The username, okay. I've waited my whole life to take over my parents multi-million dollar bakery. They're heavy into gambling and can't stop. So they're just lingering while making me do all the work and not getting the credit for the most part. It's an I can't outshine the king type of situation. My pops is a narcissist and so is my mother. I'd open up my own in a different city, but they're almost ready to retire. However, they know they can't because of their gambling addiction. I can't leave and open up my business because they need me. Do you have any advice? Well, it's crazy because this touch so heavy on the first question. This is a more detailed version. And I love that you asked them because the first one was a little more broad. This gets real deep. And like what I think is amazing about this Q and A session is that like when I use my examples of like, your mom is toxic. I don't go into like both your parents are gambling. Like this is perfect. This one's fun. So thank you. Look, I think though, I think this is a different nuanced question. And I'm so glad that people are gonna be able to hear it because somebody might be in the exact same situation or instead of gambling, it might be alcoholism. Or instead of gambling and alcoholism, it might be expending, right? Their parents are just shopping and traveling. So it might make it more real for someone. But the answer is the same as the first one. The answer is very simple. They're in charge. They will never know if they jumped off too soon. Like, so for example, if I go on to say what I'm about to say, leave, leave, go do it. Because I think just the trauma and the emotional baggage is worth it even if you do financially less than inheriting. Also, I'm not so sold that they'll ever get off the payroll. Like a lot of people in this situation are like, they're about to leave and they stay for another nine years. And so he's just wasting another three, four years before he realizes that, right? But to me, what I want him to hear or them could be shit or others is you'll never know. For example, in this situation, if they leave and then their parents are like, oh, I'm retiring a year later and they give it to like the cousin or they sell it, he'll be like, fucking Gary Vee, give me the wrong. Not true. If you stayed, they might have not left. If you leave, they're gonna be out because they're stuck or they're gonna go back and work in the business or they're gonna find some other chap, like a manager or a niece to come and play your role. So I want this person to know they wouldn't know anyway. There is no right answer. They leave now, that plays out that way. They don't leave, they never know. And I do believe if I'm reading this question right, as long as they stay, the parents are staying, given the circumstance. So he has to play a game of chicken. Tell them you're leaving, make the actions, like fly to Cincinnati and look at a location. Like act as if you're playing a game of chicken to try to get them to bluff so that they would view it as, well, let's get our son or daughter to make some sort of deal with us so we get some monies versus they're leaving and we know we can't or don't want to run this anymore and it's gonna go to zero. And then most of all, if you have double narcissistic parents, they're probably gonna call your bluff. So not only do I need him or her to act as if they're leaving, I need them to be prepared to leave. So you really wanna inherit it because it sounds like you put in the work to inherit it, but you've gotta be mentally prepared to leave. Look, some may listen to this and be like, man, poor person's in a tough spot. A lot of other people that have nothing to inherit are like, fuck this kid, Nepo baby. Life is how you see it. By the way, if you're one that always is like Nepo baby or lucky or any, you're not seeing it well. Like weaponizing envy and jealousy from the perspective of your position is why everyone's unhappy in life. It's insane what happens when you actually just decide to be happy for everyone. That has a good and to be compassionate, sympathetic and empathetic to everybody that has a bad and just kind of be neutral about all of it. It's a level of detachment from one's own self-interest that most people are never able to get to. Spiritually, mentally, emotionally. Bro candle co. Bro candle co. Yeah. Love it. I'm fired up already. Let's go bro candle crow. I wanna buy some candles already. All right, go ahead. Having a debate with my brother. Okay. I'm working on social media believing it's not just luck but an element of skill and consistency required. He thinks it's pure luck. So my question is, is going viral pure luck? No, viral is not 100% skill. Otherwise I'd go viral every day. But it's definitely not pure luck. Otherwise, like what do we talk about here? Like there's a reason Mr. Beast and I and others like are successful and consistently successful. What have I just been lucky for 20 years? So I think both of you are right, but you're more right because you're choosing optimism and he's choosing cynicism. Anybody who weaponizes luck in life is really interesting position where they have to really self-reflect and ask themselves why they think that. Now, I don't know the dynamics here. By the way, the brother that's asking the question could be in the wrong. He might be not working that much, not working that hard. And is like posting twice a day on social, kind of putting in three hours of real work, even though maybe 10 hours are eaten up. And other bro might be making the candles, running the ops, running the finance, running the bucket management, like doing like 10 hours of real work and might have some sort of feelings. So let's not jump to conclusions again. As they always say, there's like two sides to the story and then there's the actual truth. But to answer the question directly, not the underlining question that I can smell in the question, virality is not pure luck. It is also not pure skill-ish. You have to have the skill to put yourself in a position to be viral, including if you go viral for something silly, you have to have the skill of humor. Like why do we continue to diminish people's things? I do not judge what the consumer values. If they value attractiveness, I do not judge, I understand. If they value humor, I do not judge, I understand. If they value information, I do not value, I understand. If they value communication delivery capabilities, I do not judge, I understand. Like if you are a human, this is actually a very important moment in the entire thing, if you are a human being that shits on a piece of content or a human being that has gone viral, you are very likely deploying a massive level of jealousy that is suppressing your ability to have the same thing happen. Instead of saying like the hot to a girl is like an idiot and this is fucked up and then, why don't you understand what it means? Like what does it mean that like sexual innuendo jokes over index and society? What does it mean? I'll give you an example for me. Does it mean that, let me use a good one. Does it mean that sexuality and sex is a foundational human characteristic, animalistic characteristic that is a universal understanding that makes both sexually expressive parts of the world or sexual, I mean, I don't think a lot of Americans realize how sexually prude America is compared to most of the world. Is a lot of the world's problems created in our relationship with sex as human being? I would say there's a lot of deep shit to what I just said. I feel like I got a lot of huzz or aha in this answer. Like my framework when I see stuff go viral is why. And I wanna go deep, not surface, I wanna get in there. Most people are like that's stupid, this is silly, fuck her, this is garbage, that's funny, ha ha, cool, silly, it's like people go into like dumb shit. Never had a moment where something did get popular and you yourself just was like, I don't get it. I don't get a lot of things. I get that part. I get the part that I don't get a lot of things. The audacity and lack of humility, Dustin, of a human being saying I don't get it and thinking that means it's true is one of the most laughable behaviors in society. Who the fuck do you think you are? You're the composition of eight billion people's interests. I get that my opinion doesn't matter. It's so funny because have you heard the term what aboutism? What aboutism? I have not heard that yet. It's like this phenomenon online where people will see a video and think that it needs to be catered to them. So it's like what about me? Like I didn't get this, but what about me? I don't like when we create new words. Like imposter syndrome is an insecurity. What aboutism is fucking audacity and lack of humility. I don't need to make a new term for it. You motherfuckers who are listening and watching almost all of you are deeply grounded. By the way, I'm a human being. Of course I have audacity and insecurity, but my levels, like in the same way some people are just fucking diesel and zero percent, like I'm fucking deep on this one. It's my superpower. I don't need what aboutism coined. I know that most people aren't happy because they're audacious and lack humility. And they don't see it in me because they get the version of me that seems convicted, competent. But what makes me behind the scenes, like really operate is my humility and curiosity. Like when I see humble hedgehog, right? And curious crane, like envy friends, I'm much more like attached to that and conviction cockroach and competent cobra. Even though I like those characters too. I'm a mix, but people are lacking humility, which is why they don't have confidence. Tough to get to pure confidence. People call it ego. Ego's insecurity disguises confidence. True confidence's foundation is humility. Why would I care what people think? Of course I'm not the right cup of tea for most. Of course most people don't think I'm the best looking, the smartest. People have different flavors, different tastes. Like what the fuck's the matter with everyone? Your audacity is eating up your life. Almost everything I don't get. I get that's the way it's supposed to be. And I get excited about my curiosity to figure out. I get everything because there's only 13 things. I may not get it in the nuance, but look where I went with the Hak'tua thing. I went to core depths of humans' relationship with sexuality. There's only 10 things. There's only two things. Good and bad. Light and dark. Then underneath there's 10, 15 things that represent that and that's why everything's easy for me to read. Show me a human. Let me audit their parents where they grew up in what era. And I'll tell you the fuck they are. Simplicity is what's complicated for most. It's just simple out here. You take it all the way to the bottom of like, just care about the health, well-being of the people you love. Fuck it. If you can go all the way there, you will skip and whistle through life. Everything you add on top of that, will fuck you up. How do you think we got to a place of over-complicating everything? Materialism has really hurt people. We've lost our way with valuing stuff and achievement over family and community. You know, people find that I love collecting. I love chat. But it's like, it's my hobby, not my life. My work is my hobby. I do not get my self-validation for my professional career. I just do that. You see, you know how I play basketball? The fuck does that pickup game mean? It means nothing, right? I go harder in playing a pickup game than I do in running my companies. It means more to me. But why? Like why? Because I'm very passionate about it. I love it and I'm not in control. In business, I'm passionate about it, but I'm in control. That's why I wanna buy the jet, so I can just take control of this thing that's pissing me off. I also believe that if you care about things that are silly, it's actually very healthy. I'm very hot on this thesis. How do you define what's considered silly and not silly? What's not silly is like, politics is not silly. Because it affects people. Yeah. Sports is silly. Does work silly? I think work is, and this is why I'm shredding lightly because you see where I was about to go. Like everybody has to define it. I think living within your means is not silly. Like while I'm on this tangent, let's get to the punchline because we're going pretty deep here. Everybody on earth gets happier if they live within their means. I think the credit card has a chance to go down as one of society's biggest vulnerabilities. Like in history, it's a new invention. While I've been chilling with the credit card for 50 years, like I think the credit card is, again, it's not the credit card's fault. It actually can be remarkable if you know what you're doing. I just think most people don't know what they're doing. I think people don't live within their means. That's why I always attack the American dream of owning your house. I love it. Fine, it's an asset. I get it. But motherfucker, people don't play it right. Everybody maximizes their deposit. Gives them no cash flow. Anything tweaks off. Now they're living paycheck to paycheck. This is why I attack fancy cars and watches. Kudos to all the fucking big shout out, big shout out to all the gangster entrepreneurs who've built something sustainable that allows them to afford a $500,000 watch and they don't even think about it. The way most people think about buying a $5 soda. They're worried about the people that bought it that if God forbid something gets fucked up or they get quitshed thing, get quick rich thing gets fucked up. They have to sell that to a pawn shop and lose 80%. Like it's nuanced. Live within your means. Have four lamppos. If that's within your means, easy peasy and you like them. I live that. I buy very expensive pieces of cardboard. I would argue most more people universally think that watches and lamppos are better than trading cards. Too many people don't live within their means. That's what's killing. So it is a job silly. If you're living deeply within your means, it can be. You got tons of savings. You don't need a job for five years. If you guys, I don't know your situation. Both of you had 10 years worth of salary saved. My intuition is you'd be less concerned about losing your job or stressed about it. Because you would have optionality. I think people do not realize how much money they spend on how many things during the course of a year and how much it is gone. Like people don't think about savings. And everyone's like inflation and we got fucked by the boomers and no accountability. You know what the boomers think? The boomers think like, I didn't go out to eat every day. We cooked at home. You know what the boomers think? They're like, we didn't have seven purses. I've won purse for nine years. I think people, some people would argue life is short. So I'm just gonna do whatever I want. Then stop complaining. You picked your short path, shut your fucking mouth. By the way, on the record, you can do whatever fuck you want. Don't complain. By the way, a lot of people are right for their individual life, right? Like man makes plan, God laughs. Somebody out there decides to live, burn a fuck, burn it to the ground like fucking $100,000 jet, great enjoyment, live their life. And they were destined to get hit by a car in Di of 41. They played a right, potentially. It also depends if that's where you get your joy. I can tell you that's not where I get my joy. I know a lot of people do and that's awesome. But look, I get my joy of sitting courtside at Nixki. That requires money. Again, we all are doing it different. I think everybody can do everything if they shut their fucking mouth. Almost all my content is based on people that talk. I would argue my whole framework is about complaining. I think everything's cool if you don't hurt anyone and you don't complain. You can do whatever the fuck you want. And if you're complaining, I'm assuming you're upset. You know what I complain about? I don't wanna go to the gym. And guess what? I don't like it. So complaining comes from a place of unhappiness. I was gonna ask like how black or white are you on complaining? I'm black and white, but that's not, I think that's where we're about to go. Listen, I was raised in a household that demonized the fuck out of it to a point where I think it went too far. Then you start getting into not sharing real life shit. So I think there's a fine line here. Like I am concerned about that part. But yeah, I'm visceral to complaining. I think sharing your struggles is healthy therapy. It's how you form a good relationship, real candor. I think that's different than complaining. And I think that's why everybody's so upset because now people think they're not in charge of their lives. They literally think that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are their life in America. Stock markets collapsed last, right? Several days. More Buffett sold all his stocks a couple of weeks ago. Remember I mentioned it? I'm like, this is the most historically correct guy of the game. We could have all just followed. I made a reference to Dustin about it. It was on Teewee Carey V. It was on Teewee Carey V. Let's clip it. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of indications that the economy might be crashing. Warren Buffett just took all his money into cash. He's usually right. So now back to accountability. Literally right now, do you understand Mackenzie? How many people write this second? Because we're in it as we're filming everyone. This is the Monday after all this tariff stuff. You could have sold all your stock. You would have made a fortune. Warren Buffett can rebuy all the shit he sold for making fortune. You could have. I'm not even following public markets. And I was aware that Warren did that. I'm like, maybe I should do that. Whose fault is that? Self-accountability sets you free. Sets you super free. It's all your fault. And the second you realize that, life becomes phenomenal. And to the counter that, yes, there are things that happen. Like was it your fault that you crossed the street when that truck came? I guess, I mean you crossed the street, but like, I get it. Like some of us are born with genetic. There's somebody who was born right now into the single most povern stricken part of our world. Of course there's things in life. But if you decide that you are fully not capable of getting out of it, well then it's a wrap. And the world's got to change its tune. That's why I get so mad at eighth place trophies because then those kids don't think it matters. And when you don't think it matters, then you don't think you can. And when you don't think you can, when adversity hits, you actually think suicide's the right option. This shit's deeper than people think. And people think it's like, oh no, no, no. They disguise it or like we need, unless you're a deeply evil person, who wouldn't want it to be okay for everybody? Like I get that, like I'm so deep into that. But where does self, like reliance on creating that start and where does it stop? And it's always grounded in wealth and knowing why are rich kids like the biggest drug addicts and the biggest fucking alcoholics? Like money is not the variable. There's just so much to it. You got to get back to fucking, you got to get back to community, man. Think it's so much better when you, you know, it's my favorite part of being friends. Watching these people build a community, it's so cool. That's why I love sports, community. It's funny because my family are really big into sports and I grew up in a house with sports as I was there and I just don't have that. And sometimes I look at my mom and my brother and I'm like, I wish that I cared because they think that's so much fun. Yeah, and it's nice for them, right? It's nice for them. But by the way, there's other things. There's religion, which brings so much community, so wonderfully. Everything is good and everything is bad. Ready? Let's break it down. Religion, such a great source of community for so many. Weaponized by others to kill. Sports, such a good sense for community for some, leads to their gambling addiction, which leads to their downfall for others, right? Wine, such an incredible thing for community and joy in collecting and learning and escapism for some, enables their alcoholism and ruins them for others. This absolutism is fucking everybody up. My friends, none of this is real. This is all just about you. Until you start looking at you, working on you, fixing you, hacking at you, understanding you, loving you, it's all you. Everybody's about them. Politicians, other religions, other countries, other genders, other races, other sexual orientations, other income levels, under other them, them, them, them, them. Your life is about them, which is why you're unhappy, which is why you're not fully fulfilled. It's you. Get right with you. And then once you get right with you, an amazing thing happens. Then you start loving them. Then you start wanting to help them. You mentioned imposter syndrome. Yes, let's go to it. You have Liz asked, I started my business at 50 years old and it's successful, but I still have issues with imposter syndrome and confidence in raising my pricing. How to overcome that? I don't know her, but whether it's riding a bike, swimming, kissing someone for the first time, having sex for the first time, going to middle school. First day of middle school, first day of high school, first day of college if you want to, first day of a new job. Everything's scary until you do it. I think asking for more money is actually one of the easiest things to ask for because I'm comfortable with no. Liz isn't. When you ask for a higher price, if they say no and you're understanding that you're capable of saying, okay, I'll take what you're offering or you're able to say no, I'm sorry, I have to move on, you're good. Too many people get upset because they feel like that no is like some sort of form of validation. What about the idea of getting a no that ruins the relationship? It can't, never in the history of somebody asking for more money respectfully, empathetically, calmly, with context has that ruined. If I cut your hair for 15 years and you walked in right now and I'm like, how much do you pay for your haircut? 40. 40. And you walk in and I'm like, Dustin, you know what? You're a fucking motherfucker. I've been doing this for 15 years and like, you take me for granted, I'm $55 an hour, all right? Well, that can ruin the relationship. Like the fuck just happened? Cause I've been holding it in and I didn't know how to ask and I had a bad moment just happen or I lost 10 of my clients or I saw you get a haircut on social media by somebody else but the reason you, Dustin, did that was it was in my video and the guy came to our room and did it and you just took it but like that triggered me. Fear leads to bad interactions versus dust. You've been with me for a long time. Once you know something, it's April, it's April 7th right now. Starting the Monday after starting September 10th, big shout out Sasha Vaynerchuk, that's his birthday. Starting September 10th, you know, I'm going to $55. I wanted to give you a lot of time, you know, my hope is that you see the value in what I do but I want to give you enough time in case you wanted to consider going somewhere else. I really want to keep you, I need your business. If you're like, hey, Gary, I'm sorry, like my fucking boss Gary Vee's a real dick. He hasn't given me a raise in a while. I'm going to stay at 40. Then I'm like, you know what Dustin said, but it was really like, can you do me a favor? Don't tell anyone cause I'll grandfather you. I may not grandfather everyone. It would undermine, that's a very different conversation. And that's the hard one. That's a current cluster. If you're 40 bucks haircut, ready, watch this. And I'm always 40 bucks, bravy for you. Mackenzie, let's role play. Mackenzie, come in and be like, how much is your haircut? How much is your haircut? $50. Okay. Now Mackenzie can be like, hey, I heard you were 40 and I can make a decision. Mackenzie could say yes. Mackenzie say that's a little too much. I'm going to go shop somewhere else. I'm in control of my next move. Many times in my career, I've said this much, they've said no, and I'm like, okay, I'll take that. Many more times, thankfully, cause I keep ascending, I say VaynerMedia, my speaking fee, everything. I say, and they leave and I'm cool with it. And many of those times they come back and want it. And you see that at the baseball card shows, at the national. If you look carefully, you'll film this year, I'll negotiate. Sometimes they walk, so they come back, so they say no. But it's not scary. I get that it's scary for many, but done respectfully. And knowing that you can change your mind and go back. And realizing there, no, doesn't mean that you're not good or you're good or this or that. Once you get there, you're unstoppable. And imposter syndrome must be eliminated. Websters, I don't know if you, I assume you put it in your book, take it back out, leave it there, it's like, we just are going back to being insecure. People are putting makeup on big words to make it more palpable. You both know this. It's an insecure way of saying insecure. Well said. Think about with your homies, you're like, you guys are in that age group, you're in life the last 10 years, right? Imposter syndrome, it hits so different if your friend's like, I'm just insecure to ask people, what the fuck, you're getting coddled when you use imposter syndrome. You're getting pushed harder if you say, every single person's gonna resonate with this right now. You tell your homies, your best friends, your parents, whoever, your boss, you say imposter syndrome, you get coddled again. You say insecure, you get imposter syndrome. You get pushed. Say it out right now, everybody, take a pause. Hey, man, I'm really struggling with insecurity to ask for a raise. What the fuck, Don, go for it, you're the fucking best. I have some real imposter syndrome to ask for a raise. Yeah, me too. It's a fucking coddle, fucking circle jerk. Imposter syndrome is another word that's being used by the fucking over-coddling society. I'm gonna say this on the record, so there's no confusion. I believe the over-coddling society was well-intended. I don't think they had some bad agenda. I don't think they're trying to fuck up the USA. I think it was well-intended. But I also think it was delusional, driven by parents that didn't have their life in order in understanding how much entitlement, how much prosperity we have. This is why immigrants and people of less means just shit on this. They're fucking tired of hearing people that have it so good complaining. I have all sorts of people watching. The CEO of a Fortune 100 right now watching, making 38 million a year, can making $38 a year in a small part of the world is watching right now. And everybody in between, we're all hearing shit different. I'm trying to go to the universal truth. Whether you're making 100,000 a year, 4 million a year, or 4 cents a year, get other people's names out of your mouth. Stop judging people and you'll stop judging yourself. Stop judging people and you'll stop judging yourself. Stop judging people and you will stop judging yourself. You stop judging yourself, you will fucking move fast, light, happy. No pressure on the chest. That's why I sleep so well. How do you stay consistent with daily content when you're in a highly regulated industry like finance, where every single piece of content has to be approved by compliance and marketing? Who's this? Doesn't say. LinkedIn though. Very easy, cause there's people that do it and get ahead of your content. Excuse City USA regulated industries. Yes, I'm aware that there's things for the SEC and by the way, there's things for not marketing to kids. And by the way, there's things for not marketing to with alcohol. Diageo's a client. Mattel and Hasbro both have been clients. Chase and Visa are clients and big clients. I've seen it all. Excuses, your piece of content may take three days to come out or nine days to come out instead of right away, cause it has to go through compliance. The fuck does that have to do with making content? That means you're just on a nine day behind cycle. You make a piece of content out, comes out in nine days. I make a piece of content tomorrow, comes out in 10 days. I make two pieces of content next day, comes out in 11 days. Sounds like if you keep doing this, you're starting your real life in nine days. Fucking excuses, y'all. You got all sorts of excuses to me. I'm a perfectionist, I'm in a regulated industry. I'm this, I'm that. You don't wanna do the work. I got excuses too. Mackenzie, I got excuses. I'm like, I was out late on doing whatnot last night. It's so late. I'm traveling so much from London. I just took a long flight. I got excuses for days when it comes to being in the gym. By the way, this is why it's so easy for me to understand what people are doing at work in their career. Cause I do it in the gym. I smell it on you cause I got it in me too. Not in this category. You saw when we were in the offsite and me and you worked out, people didn't want that heat. I was like, Andy Rips, they don't want it. Right? But Rips is willing to work 19 hours a day. And others might not want that. Right? We all have discipline. Some people are disciplined eaters, working out, parents, readers, you know, like entrepreneurs and other people aren't. But I've also won in the gym in a certain way. That's why I'm like, the gym has really mattered to me because I'm so far along compared to where I was. That means everybody here can make progress on their personal brand, on their career, on their entrepreneurial side hustle, on their actual startup, on their business. We can all get better, every one of us. And that's staying within the walls we work in. Back to the big shit. We can all start new relationships and break up with ones that are hard, spouse, siblings. I said this the other day, I'm not advocating for divorce. I'm saying we can be accountable. You can move to Thailand. Good? Like everything is yes, maybe. And everyone's a no. Because they're more comfortable laying in the muck of their excuse. Second, you understand that? You get happy. People don't see that. The last 25 years of parenting is the person sucks. You're like, no, you don't suck, baby. It's just, it's their boss's fault. It's your teacher's fault. It's society's fault. You got fucked. You were born in the wrong era. This Gen Z thing of like wrong era. Best era. Motherfuckers are complaining that the boomers ruined it and making millions of dollars is 22 year olds. There was zero 22 year old millionaire South made fucking 40 years ago. Best era. What 16 year old could fucking grab a phone, make a video of themselves dancing and become a multi-millionaire in three years. In 1986, shut your mouth. You should kiss the ground the boomers lived on if you're talking about the era. Separation of wealth, yes. Inflation, yes. But doesn't mean you can't. You can more than ever. You know what really makes me throw up? A lot of these, like I really know a lot of shit and a lot of people, there's people that make content shitting on boomers whose grandparents left them $5 million. People need to shut their fucking mouth is what really needs to happen. If they're spitting poison. Stop being negative, y'all. Fuck. The only one that's losing if you spew negativity is you. With such a large team, how do you manage one-on-one meetings effectively? What do you do to ensure everyone feels heard, valued and supported? You know, it's funny and this is a tricky one. The real answer is you just schedule as many one-on-ones as possible. I'm sad that I can't do that for Vayner now. I really did it for those first hundred. That's how we became the culture that we became. I think the most important thing is for people to really know you're there and they need them. I would say that both of you have felt times of like needing more one-on-one time with me or at least a one-on-one time with me. But I would also argue that if I really pushed you that you would both admit under a lie detector test that if you really needed me, if you're like, I really need 15 minutes with you, I think you both know it would be done immediately, not even in a week. Yes? Yeah. The fact that both of you could say absolutely, that's what I think is the answer to everybody. The answer to the question is you need to make everybody feel like you can be there if they need you in an emergency and then you need to use your intuition on knowing who to talk to when. You know? Like if you feel it. Like, and then you do things, right? You do little things like when you interact with people digitally, like there'll be times where I can feel a little something and I'll go out of my way of like great job, Mackenzie. If I'm like, you know, like doing little baiting to see if they'll jump on that. Like I don't do it to avoid the meeting. In fact, I do it to create the meeting. You know, when I give Aaron a compliment on our team as I've started to do a little bit, right? That's like, okay, she's like, okay, I'm being seen by him. If I need him, I feel now more comfortable to get him. Not, I'm doing that so I don't have to do it. I'm actually always open to do it and always open to not do it. Again, I don't wanna create the fucking circle of over-coddling. I wanna do it when you need it. Cause that creates scale and it also creates resilience and the ability to address things themselves. Other times, I mean, I just told somebody it's been in the company for nine years and I was disappointed with them for not coming earlier. But they were trying to do the resilience thing. So it's all fucking balance. Balance, balance, balance, balance, balance. By the way, if you wanna start collecting VFRIENDS, which I recommend to all of you, the Balanced Beetle. Actually, I want everybody who's listening right now to stop and take the quiz. VFRIENDS.com slash quiz. Find out which VFRIEN you are. I am literally building the next Marvel and Pokemon in your faces and 99% of you that are in the middle of this video right now or in the podcast literally are not collecting. It's a huge mistake, especially if you have somebody under 10. What your mom and brother have, that's what VFRIENDS is. If you have a kid under 10, immediately collecting VFRIENDS together cause you can use the VFRIENDS to teach them really good attributes will change your life forever cause it will make you and your child closer. My sister and I are very close. We talk a lot about the fact that me and AJ have similar interests, which has allowed us to be close. In a way that me and my sister are is different. We have different kinship. We grew up together and we're like closer in age and we're so close. But like if my sister like collected trading cards and like was a diorgetic, like it's different. Similar interests matter. Finding those with your children matter. For a lot of people who are watching right now, I really think VFRIENDS can be that. Plus I think VFRIENDS is a co-parent. Like when you have to tell your kid what tenacious termite means and you start talking. Some people never talk about tenacity. Did your parents ever talk to you about tenacity? I don't even think we do the definition. Yours? Great. I believe that if you open a pack of VFRIENDS and your seven year old gets tenacious turkey. They're like, mom, what's tenacious turkey? And you talk to your kid about tenacity that that will have a disproportionately meaningful impact on your life in a way that I don't think most people understand. I believe gritty goes tenacious termite, right? Like accountable aunt. This now goes into what the modern parenting needs to get back to purple, back to the middle. We don't talk about that shit. We don't talk about it and it's nothing. Resilience, grit, accountability. These will change kids' life. So I'm pumped about that. Sorry for that little VFRIENDS commercial. But I'm telling you, you're fucking up if you're not part of VFRIENDS, come and join us. I know you say it's all about the individual piece of content, but I feel like my videos don't get seen by enough people to get me any traction. All my TikToks are me recapping the show Survivor and I don't have many followers. Can you tell me how to find the success? You're always talking about where someone with only a few followers gets a million views. Happens all the time. Now, a million's hard. A few, 10 followers, a million views happens. Happens actually all the time, which is nuts, which is why this is the greatest year of social media. But the answer to the question is garyv.com slash attention. If you don't have 15 bucks. And the answer is day trading attention. There is a skill to this. The end. This person clearly stinks. And that's okay. I stink at a lot of stuff too. I would argue we stink at TikTok. We're not growing. Like you have to give it love. What's my answer? My answer is I made a 44 page deck for free. Here it is. Flash it. For everybody who's listening garyv.com slash attention. Download it, read it, implement it, do it for a year, and then call me back. I have a funny feeling you'll have a post that does well. I'm gonna be a real leader about that life. If you got 20 bucks, go to Amazon and buy day trading attention. I went deep on this last book. It is a fucking banger. Let me do a break real quick. We'll be right back everybody. I'm just gonna check. Make sure there's no fires. Barbara said, I am 44 years old and decided to become an author. I'm currently working on a book as a self publisher. Part of that is creating a social media presence to reach people, but social media really can be extremely draining and time consuming for me. The reality is I'm not really into that part of the process and instead just want to write. Do I really need to be the one to do all of that in order to be noticed? If you wanted to sell, Barbara. Now, good news Barbara. You could be an author that is one in a million that just wrote such a book that it went viral by itself. Good news Barbara. You could take money you have if you have any. I don't know if you do. And you can hire someone to do the social media for the book. Just depends on what you want my friends. Like I didn't make up the rules. Like I just hope everybody understands that. I didn't make up the rules that the way the world works is like people need to know about something to consider it to buy it. I didn't make up the rules that distribution changes. Like yes Barbara, in 1967 you might have wrote a book. A, you wouldn't be able to self publish in 1967 without the internet. Barbara. B, let's just play a fantasy world that you could. Yes, and a bookstore owner that was prominent might put you at the front of the table and hand sell it because they liked the book just like I did for wines. There are many wines that I Gary Vaynerchuk. There's one Boudreau. I think it's Boudreau. There was one Washington state high-end wine that I just happened to buy. That I just happened to luckily walk down the aisle at Wine Library and grab and put on the table that I opened and my palate just happened to think it was remarkable. I freaked out, looked in the back of the label, told everybody what the address or email or phone number was, linked it into my Wine Library TV post and sent hundreds of people, thousands of people to the mailing list and now it sold when it didn't before. That happens. Luck is life. You don't have to do shit Barbara. But you're self publishing which means you're self selling. If you want people to read it, if you'd like it to be commercially successful, yes you have to market. But by the way, you don't have to do social media, go do 50 podcasts. But who the fuck wants you on without social media? People confused out here. Barbara, can I ask you something? I'd like to look like an Adonis without eating well and exercising like a freak. Possible? She can say yes, steroids and plants, osemic. Sounds expensive. Yale says. Yale. Yale. Any advice for someone going into a new work field at 30? To realize you don't need any advice. 30? You're a fucking kid. Honestly, 30 and 22 is the same exact thing. You know, like don't compare. Don't say I wish I started, like here's a good one. You started, Yale starts at 30, couple weeks in and she's like, I'm fucking loving this. We've had that happen at Vayner. We were very weird because of our residency program. We have a lot of people come in at like 29 and some of them will meet with me one on one and they're like, I wish I came in with all these 20 year olds. I'm like, why? Right, right, right. 20's when I started. You started what? I was like 29 or something. When you came to Vayner? Yeah. I'm sure it might, you're a human. I'm sure it might have run through your mind, especially if you decided, I mean, you've obviously been here a little while, it's going well, like you might've been like, damn, I should have done this at Torment. But what? What is I should have or I wish? Poisonous sentence starters. I should have, I wish that. Like, so let's play out the scenario. Here's my advice, you're 30, you walk in, you love it. You found your place, which happens to a lot of people. You know yourself better at 30 than you do at 22. 18. Promise me Yale that you won't be like, I wish I did this or I should have done this at 22. Be grateful, be humble. Yes, you're, what do you worry about? Starting behind? If you're talented in a year, you might be past people that have been there for seven years. There have been people in our company that have started 20. I mean, catch me in one of those people. I mean, well, I don't really look very far, you're right here. 28, you come in and a year later, you're more advanced than people that have been at the company for five years. Sounds like you're at the same place. So don't cry. Next, like about what could have. That's another one, what could have. I should have, I wish. There's just, it is. Accept it. Swallow the pill of reality. It's good fucking medicine. It's a lot better than this dwelling potion you all fucking drink every morning. I like that the pills of reality are more delicious than the potions of delusion. I like that. We need to make that as a picture card and then clip this. When you swallow reality pills, they're yummy. When you drink delusional potion, it's sending you down a bad path. Now the other version, Yale walks in and a month in, it's a disaster. She's like, what the fuck was I thinking about medical field? I'm scared of blood, what the fuck was I thinking? Don't beat yourself up. Good news. Let's say you walk in and it's a disaster shit show. You're just gonna text me DM me next year and say any advice for somebody starting in a new field at 31. And I'm gonna give the same advice. At 33 and 37, the pills of reality are delicious. They're like those old like Flintstones vitamins. They tricked you into taking that shit. Even though it's probably bad for you. That's why it tastes so good. They said the closet ones would eat them all. You did? You did? Because they were candy. They were a little fucked up. They're like chalk, but they got all the kens. It's all the same shit. You know that, right? Like I said earlier, it's only two things. Optimism, pessimism, good, bad, light, dark, hope, fear. And there's the same cliche 13 things underneath. Mom, dad, siblings, bosses, you know? And now a new one, public persona, right? We're all learning that. That's what got everybody on tilt. All this anxiety was always there. But now people that were trying to impress everybody in their family and neighborhood, now they gotta impress everybody in the world. Got it? The scale got heavier. But it's the same shit. I love everyone who was like, it's all fucked up now. Like everybody was an alcoholic in the 60s. What are we talking about? We didn't talk about these feelings back then. We got better, we're better. But everybody thinks it's worse because we talk about everything. It's better. If you're watching or listening, you pick the single best time to ever be alive. But mainstream media is not gonna make you think that. And then the people on social media, amplifying mainstream media, are not gonna make you think that. But guess what? I'm gonna make you think that. And I'm right here and I'm social media. Dust, go put on the fucking television. Go open the newspaper. Show me the positivity. Cause I'm right here at Act Gary V. And I'm not the only one. So ironically, social media has got a lot more positivity, optimism, practicality than television. But people wanna blame it. Cause that's the narrative that mainstream media wants to take. Those motherfuckers are pushing poison. I got no time for them. I got no time. I turned those on to know everything. But I don't let those motherfuckers penetrate me. Those fucking insecure pushers, poison pushers, negativity pushers. Negativity is fucking everybody up. Cut negativity out of your life. Television, social media. Mommy, daddy, toxic boys, boss, excuse me, anybody, everybody. Cut, limit, cut, limit, cut, limit. Cut when it doesn't matter. Random friend, cut. Limit when it's mommy. I don't advocate for fully cutting out toxic mom. I advocate for limiting it and putting pressure on her. Mom, we gotta go to therapy together. What are you talking about? That. What about people that do cut off their mom too easily? Do you think that's like too extreme? I don't know if it's too extreme. It usually means that they have the same traits. Means they're struggling with the empathy and compassion they're seeking. In your experience, what's the number one thing that holds people back from progressing within a company? And what feedback do you give someone in your own company that's being held back because of this? That's a great question. Many things hold back people from growing in a company. Number one, things that have nothing to do with them. Timing. It's about to happen if we go into this procession. Like if companies are shrinking, there's no growth. On top of that, I've seen internal memos from major companies saying you cannot add for raises or headcount without showing us your AI plan. So moments in time, that's number one. And then the human has to be self-aware to know that that's what's going on. They gotta bunker down. You know what I mean? Number two, lack of self-awareness, which would hurt them on number one, it's going on. It's like some people, everybody wants to think they're better than they are, which is nice in some ways, but they don't have good awareness. Number three, they value something the company doesn't. They're like, I'm always on time and Johnny's not. Yeah, Johnny's 15 minutes late, but Johnny's done $18 million in business, so you've done $600,000. You know, I'm the biggest, let's do the reverse. I'm fucking, this plays out of Vayner in a real way. I'm fucking doing 10 million. Mackenzie's doing $600,000. How did she get promoted? Your addiction that everybody hates you and you're on the verge of getting fired, even though you do 10 million. So people judge what they want the company to value without getting clarity of what the company values. Monster one, monster. That's like at the top of my droplet. I think I just changed 37 people's lives. Listen on the first day. And by the way, that just goes to like real shit. You're not accountable. You're not self-aware. You're not ideological. You're not empathetic. These are all real things. Number four, they're poor communicators. They're not communicating well to their bosses on what their goals are, what they need, what's the truth, how they see it so that then the boss can counter. Number five, since it's my favorite number, I'm gonna go right at it because the place they work is fucked up. I'm taking them for granted. That creates 5B. That means you should quit. Gary can't afford to quit. I got rent, no shit, Dick. Go on LinkedIn, hit up recruiters, start actively putting in the work to be able to get out. Number six, they're over-reliant on just one mentor. One boss is like, I got you, but that boss doesn't have all the juice and there's three other bosses. I still have, by the way, you guys know we're doing a May race cycle and in October you work at a company. I just was in a meeting last week about this. Somebody walked in and was like, boom, boom, you know, we're doing our planning, talent planning, they're like, boom, boom, Johnny's number one, gotta get that raise. The other four bosses that are the equals in the different divisions, like Johnny's the worst, everyone hates him. So that, Johnny in that scenario, latched up to Dustin's, like Dustin's got me, Dustin told me he's got it, but Dustin, it's not Dustin Media, it's fucking VaynerMedia. So there's a process, so they misunderstood the game. That's the biggest vulnerability there. They didn't grow because they found one person they thought is gonna take care of them, but they kept up the bad behavior overall that the company doesn't value and somebody had a bigger stick than their boss. Lack of self-awareness, poor communication skills, delusion and ideology that's selfish, non-action, all real shit. This is why I get so pumped, like this, like I feel like this answer might like help someone realize I ain't doing shit, like I know someone's watching this and is in this spot and like, I don't do any of that shit. That's what I keep telling you, like it's on you, you're in charge. So if you're upset, it's your fault. Real talk, whether, and this is like the most three-dimensional chess part of the statement, whether I'm right or wrong. Got it? Like I get that back to circumstances. There's many things that happen in life that aren't your fault. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you focus on what you control under the framework of I, it's my fault that I'm not happy because I have options. If I do things that are hard, people don't hear it. To get into that place, you have to do the things that are hard, not just easy. Something you said, you said most people think they're better than they are or something. Most better, most people think that they're better than they are in the frame of it. If they're not, noticed I gave you that answer in the context of your question. Gotcha. Why am I not getting promoted? You're delusional. Or you have a bad judgment engine. Either you're delusional or the company's bad at guessing on talent, but you're in control of both. But I can tell you, in Vayner, it has been, some of, I love stand-up comedy. Some of the best stand-up comedy I've ever heard is from employees telling me why they deserve to get promoted. And everybody loves this. But McKenzie, but Avi, but Mona, has nothing to do with you. People think it is, everything to do with you. We were used to be the same title. I heard they made more money than me now. Like the company decided, the company is humans, inherently flawed, could be wrong. You think they're wrong, get another job. Or go and have communication. Or go listen, like get answers. And if you don't like the answer, one thing that's very clear to me is, I know people at Vayner give bullshit answers to our employees about why not? Cause they're friends with them. I know that, cause I did that my whole life. Lack of candor. This last five, six years, I've been really getting in there and giving people, works kind of candor. Back to the haircut. I'm not like, the fuck are you talking about Dustin? What about this, this, this? No, no, hey, I think these are the things you need to work on. This is how I'm judging. Coolest part in our company that I've made huge, and this might be good for bosses, every person that's fired at VaynerMedia, and every promotion and salary increase, I sign off on. Obviously we're so big now, like I'm going at the mercy of some of my people now at this level. But I still like keep, you know, it's a good check and balance limit. But anybody who's less than a hundred employees should do that at scale. Why? It's almost like the US government. It's good to have Congress, the Senate, like by me being a check to my managers, it gives you, if you know that's true, which it is, now you got me and Sid. It gives you a little bit more like, you're not like, if you're like, man, I'm just at the mercy of Sid, me and Sid don't have a good relationship, I'm fucked. But if you're like, damn, I got Gary too, or vice versa, Sid can advocate for Gary, Gary doesn't see me. And if you, the more you can add that, the better. It gives you the employee the ability to know that you have multiple people that could impact versus being at the mercy of one. Oh no, I meant why should every company, like the- Why should every owner be the sign off on it? I tell you, build a great culture. The more it feels like a family business, the better. Even though it's impossible for Coca-Cola to pull that off, but not really, like the more it can, the CEO can more, more, more, more, more. It's not scalable, even I can't do it now. I don't have one-on-one relationships with everyone like I used to. At 200, at 300, at 500, I mean, shit, like crazy. Now at 2000 plus, global, it's hard for me to know what's going on in Indonesia. It's hard. But I keep doing these, you know this, I keep doing these zooms and off-sites and one-on-ones and all-hards. If I can spend 30, you know, I have no minutes right now, I spent 30 minutes with the resident interns this week, last week, you know, chipping away the best I can. What advice would you give to someone looking to switch careers due to burnout, but without requiring extensive education and they don't have a clear idea of what they wanna do? So you don't have education in it, and you don't even know what you wanna do. So you're just miserable in your job and you're looking very nice, yeah. I mean burnout is like also been weaponized. I don't know if this person has it or not, but I think we don't even know what burnout is as a society right now. Like if you hate your job, you're burnt out. That was treated very differently 20 years ago. You know, for a lot of people, they think of it as a mental condition, for many it's not, which sucks because then it becomes clouded for who actually has a medical condition. Everybody who's weaponizing burnout from laziness or unhappiness is really fucking it up for people that actually have medical conditions. It's really too bad. Nonetheless, my advice is to do something about it, to take online courses in the evening. Like you have to take action. It's like, again, if you're unhappy in your job, for a lot of people, it's similar to like, if you've got to get physically fit. Like that first day in the gym, when you've done nothing right for 10 years or 20 years is fucking hard. I lived it. That fucking first day, me and Mike make fun of it all the time. I did eight bullshit pushups, eight. Real talk, eight bullshit pushups. I did this like squat that like burned my fucking quads. Like it was just like everything was wrong. Like everything. And it was hard. It was really rough. And that's where the person said, like they have to network, they have to get educated. They have to spend hours on the internet, being curious to find something that strikes their fancy. They potentially need to get certified. They need to network if they're not gonna work on a degree or experience, so somebody takes a chance on them. They're gonna have to ask for favors when they might not want to, because you might need a little helping hand. In this moment. And then it goes back to perspective. Some people might be listening right now and be like, damn, that sucks. Maybe, person's got a job. 800 million people on earth, no access to clean water. Worst than this guy's situation, sounds like he's got a better life than 800 million people. And I haven't begun. I have not begun. So, yeah, it's gotta put in work. Like what's my advice? Fucking get to work. Don't ask every of you that question. You waste it two minutes. Callie. Callie. Asks, when you started building your business, how did you advertise and what did you do to build rapport or trust with your clients? I mean, there's a lot of businesses. I mean, the Wine Library was one thing that's retail. It's different. I think she's looking for a service business, VaynerMedia. I did it by working every day to four o'clock in the morning from 2007 to 2011 to build my own personal brand was selling a service that I actually did. So the respect for several was based in the fact that I actually did it, comma, 99% of Fortune 500 companies didn't care that I got a lot of followers on Twitter. So I gained rapport by having meetings. And by 90 people saying no to meetings and three people saying yes, then having good meetings, I knew what I was talking about. The truth is really an incredible partner in building reputational respect and validation. So I think for a lot of people, whether it's being a personal trainer or being my favorite, a life coach, or all these things, you've gotta prove to them that you're about it, the way you do that is actually through the conversations. What I mean by that is just getting meetings and having productive meetings. There's a lot of people who've tried to build agencies like I have who were actually better at getting meetings than me. But the shit that came out of their mouth in that meeting wasn't compelling, it wasn't right. And they didn't build anything. So I think using LinkedIn, using your social media, using your Rolodex A to Z in your phone and asking people, networking, Googling for network events and showing up to them, like you're in the sales business, gotta get out there. You're in sales and marketing, all of us are. So that's why I love social and that's why I like real events and networking and that's why I like going to A to Z in your phone, I always talk about, from Aaron Anderson to Zahri Sakariah, like who are the people in your phone right now that can help you grow your business for you asking for a favor or proposing something? Everybody, if you're not following me on what not, live social shopping, it's a place where I'm doing commerce, Tamek, which is I'm doing the Ask Air Vee show, but I'm intermingling V-Friends products into it. I think it's gonna be a whole genre in the next five years. I think this will end up being another place where I'm ahead, where you're doing what you would do in a podcast or a YouTube show, but you've also got interstitial commercials for your stuff, similar to old school television. What's going on on what not now is more QVC. What I'm talking about is like a whole different genre of like 1950s television in a lot of ways. So Google Gary Vee and then space what not, W-H-A-T-N-O-T, one word. You'll find my account, I'm sure, and Google is probably the easiest. Download the app for sure, because all of you need to learn live social shopping and follow me. And V-Friends, because that's where we usually do the T-with-Gary Vee. That's true, and V-Friends, at V-Friends. Actually, that's even better, what not. Google V-Friends, V-E-E-Friends, space what not. That's where we do T-with-Gary Vee, good call Dustin, thank you for saving me. But follow me too. Are there any good examples of commerce payment that you've seen? Or do you feel like it's just like? I don't really have the example, I feel like in my subconscious, I feel like in China that's starting to happen, or has happened, but I have not really, really seen it. I just know it to be true. So if you look it for an article, I don't know, I'll need you to do research. Because when I do research, I do feelings, and I'll go deep. If you go deep, please, that'll work. Let's get a meeting real, send 10 or 15 things and be like, is this it, is this it, you know what I mean? I will say this though about live social shopping. This might be a different, like the hidden upside of live social shopping, there's an entertainment commerce component. Well, commerce payment, I got one. I believe that people are buying on TikTok shop and whatnot, as almost a subconscious tip to the person it's on. Oh, I like this person, they made me laugh. They, like this is where they're being entertaining. I have a formatted show with heavy value entertainment, similar to this. But I think some people are doing QVC, but they're just good and funny or informational, or they already like them. A lot of people come on V-Friends from my community and just buy something as V-Friends because they know it's important to me, and they're like, this guy's given me a lot of value through the years, let me buy something. So I think just like people tip on Twitch and other platforms, people are buying things as a subconscious tip, which I think is even more valuable for the end user, the watcher, because they're getting something tangible, whereas on Twitch, they're just literally paying for the content itself. Would Patreon count as commerce payment? Probably not, though I haven't looked at it. I mean, I think we're really talking about true entertainment. Like, I think the difference between premium content and what I'm talking about is commerce payment is more like you're selling something physical, and the show you're doing it on, this QVC-like thing, is entertaining enough that's compelling someone to buy it potentially singularly or highly influenced by the fact that you are being entertained along with it. Which is different than you're paying for the premium content. Like if this two and a half hour, or two hour, whatever it is now, hour 45 minute Q&A session, was put behind a paywall and I'm like, look, I went super deep, deeper than I do with my social. And it's 4.99, a lot of people would buy that, and that's more that model. Everybody thank you for watching. If you enjoyed this, please hit me up like crazy, 212-931-5731, text me that you like this, DM me you like this, and leave comments that you liked it on all of the platforms you listen to. And if you're listening on the podcast, leaving a review for the podcast is something I've been neglecting, especially given this hardcore piece of content I just gave, hopefully I can guilt you into stopping right now and leaving a review. Your honest review, let me not prefer a five star, but if you think this is a three star podcast, leave a three star, but leave a comment. On all social, leave a review, subscribe up, all the good stuff, and definitely check out VFriends, I want not, or really, I'm literally, this is like my favorite, I'm literally building it in front of your face and a lot of you are not part of the journey. If you have somebody under 10 in your life, you should really be part of the journey, more for what it's gonna do for your relationship than even what it's gonna do for your collecting value. And that's that, Mackenzie, thank you so much. Shlepping this car for a long ride. You're riding right back, right? You're like riding right back, yeah. Yeah, so thank you, thanks Dustin. See ya. This is clearly the winning format right now.
