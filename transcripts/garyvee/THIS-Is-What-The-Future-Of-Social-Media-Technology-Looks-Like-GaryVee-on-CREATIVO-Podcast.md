## Transcript
One of the quickest ways I know that somebody will be limited in their achievements is predicated on how much they blame others. There's actually a quote here that says, the one person you need to hold accountable is you. I believe accountability is the precursor to happiness. I believe it is foundational to happiness. Accountable is accepting the truth after the fact. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, I tried to do this, it didn't work. I could blame Dustin, but I hired Dustin to film it. I could blame Dustin, but I could have looked at the edit. Once you're just always knowing that it's you, it gets good. Because then you don't feel like someone else is in control. That's why I tell everybody to die on their own sword. The train. The television. The telephone. The automobile. Yeah. The phone. These are not electricity. These are monster. Monster. I promise you. Before there was cars, it's just not that long ago. Not that long ago. People were all over the city on horses. Yeah. Not that long ago, brother. The number one thing I know is that humans will resist new technologies. It's what we do. Yeah. And for the small group of us that are the other way, there's great opportunity to create and build. And I enjoy that. I'm a software engineer. Yes. And I made an AI version of myself. Yes. Which actually hosts one episode per month of this show. Good for you. I think that's the future. What do you think about that? 100%. I think humans are going to be the intellectual property owners of themselves, of other humans. There's so much coming. So much coming. Yeah, I see that as me licensing my image. 100%. It's all NIL. Yeah. It's all name, image, and likeness. And I heard in your book that you also mentioned the mascot aspect of companies. Yes. AI is a form of a mascot for a human being. 100%. I think that's right. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of people are going to be freaked out by it at first. There's a lot of resistance. A ton. Yeah. But there is resistance to electricity. You know that? Sure. When electricity was invented, most human beings around the world, especially in Latin America, by the way, said that there was demons inside of it. Yeah. And they rather have candles. And there was resistance to. To writing. To radio, to television. To everything. How do you think we should treat these virtual versions of ourselves, talking about AI? Should we see an extension of ourselves, or as another character that looks like us? Like, what's the? I think the right way is yes, meaning both. Yeah. I think it's going to be all of the above. I should make a virtual dog and build up that profile. Why not? I should have a version of myself, a variation of myself, me and girl form. Yeah. Why not? You can actually pursue different careers. 100%. There's so much that's coming. And it's big stuff. It's crazy. It is definitely big stuff. Like, I don't view this next wave of AI and VR and virtual as some small little thing. No, no, no. It's big. And that will come with societal anxiety and new norms. There are people in Japan in full pledge relationships with VTubers. Yeah. Literally dating people that are virtual. That's crazy. But that being crazy is no different than many things that have happened through the history of humans. It was crazy to live to 100. It was crazy to date someone from the opposite sex. It was crazy to date someone from the opposite religion. It was crazy to not have children. It was crazy to not get married. It was crazy to get married if you go further back. Everything's crazy until it's not. Yeah, but I think AI, it's a different kind of crazy. Like, it's probably a success. But that's what everybody says. Yeah. Yeah, that's the same speech. When somebody said, when I did, when the version of me said, no, no, we're all going to take airplanes. And the other person said, that's a different level of crazy. I would say, well, that's what they said when we did boats. People never left their land and took to the water. But then somebody invented the boat and they did. Sure. And then the plane. I get it. Marrying a computer sounds weird to everyone right now or to marry code. But I do not believe that will be weird in 500 years. I don't. Yeah. And that's just that. Because I promise you, if a caveman was re-encarded right now and walked in here, he would struggle. Yeah. Like a lot's fucking happening. But a guy from the 1950s will struggle. That's right. Like the exponential progress in the last 30 years has been insane. That's right. We've turned from linear to exponential. Would you agree on that? 100%. So the world is getting smaller. Technology is bringing us closer together, making us go further apart. It's always doing the same shit. What's going on right now that's interesting is people are not choosing optimism. What's going on right now is that everyone's scared. Because politicians are being very effective in scaring people. And fear controls people. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Like if you think about, for example, making your way from New York to LA a couple of 100 years ago, that would take months. And some people would die in the process. 100 years ago. Right now you could take a 100 years ago. Yeah, yeah. 100 a couple. 100 years ago. 1924. But do you think there's a point in this technological evolution that we're not really going to understand the implications of what we discovered? Sure. Because for example, right now we have big data. We have all this. What about the atomic bomb? Yeah. There was a bomb created by human beings that killed an ungodly amount of people in Japan. It's terrible. Horrific. The gun. Somebody invented it. Like if you go far back enough, why does anyone get killed by anyone? Sure. Right? But they killed them with a stick if it wasn't a gun and there was a knife. And like, of course. Do I think that we're going to create robots that may kill people? Sure. Might happen. It's real life. I just don't fear because I am optimistic about human beings because human beings have proven for thousands and thousands of years that we are just, this is doomsday like, it's over. Social media, robots, AI. Like, I don't know. Because I promise you if the four of us were having dinner in 1950 after the atomic bomb was invented, I don't know if any of us would have believed that for the next 74 years nobody would use one. Yeah. After it was just used. I think the most underrated thing in the world is the human spirit. Yeah. And I agree because there's like these human tendencies that don't necessarily repeat over the years but are continuously present. Like for example, in the book you talk about collectibles that are coming back from the 80s, from the 70s, from the 50s, from the 60s. History maybe does not repeat itself, but it kind of rhymes. Like this is like a radio show in a way. And it's exactly right. So there's going to be some elements of the human nature that are going to transcend these new tools and we're still going to be necessary. Like I'm an optimist as well in this sense. But I think these new technology, like there's biotechnology, there's big data, there's quantum physics. Yeah, quantum physics, but in computer science. That's right. What's going to happen when all these things intersect? Like are we going to? What's going to happen when four things that you and I couldn't dream of get invented in the next 10, 20 years? I mean, let me ask you a question. Do you think that people are going to live outside earth? I don't know. It's an interesting question because I think there's two ways about thinking it. Forget about that. Just for fun. Just when you and I are hanging out in heaven in 400 years. We're going to be having a podcast. Yeah, and when I walk by, I'm like, hey. Remember in 2024 when we were alive? Do you believe in 400 years people live outside of earth? I think the metaverse makes a really interesting argument against it because we're turning more sedentary than ever. So we may create something virtually that substitutes the necessity humans have of exploring. So I don't know. Because there's this, like for example, do you know what the Fermi paradox is? The Fermi paradox is this question about if there has been so much time in the universe and there has been a lot of time for an intelligent species to develop and to explore the universe, where are they? Like if there are aliens, where are they? And there's this hypothesis called Transcension that it actually says that intelligent species eventually evolve so much that they surpass the necessity to travel space because they create their own reality. And I think we're seeing that in the metaverse. So we're definitely going to live in a different form and even in a different space. But maybe it's a space that we created, which is kind of interesting. I think all of that is valid. Like for example, the- Before you move on. Yeah, like- When I see you in heaven in 400 years. Do you subjectively, I don't expect you to know nobody who's listening knows. It's just a simple question. As you sit here today as a young man in this moment of your life. Not to be historically correct or not, because good news will be dead. But do you believe in 400 years that humans, human beings that live on Earth today, will evolve to a place where our great, great, great, great grandchildren live on a planet outside of Earth? Do you think? If we find a really attractive planet that it's viable, I think we would, yeah. Do you think we have the capacity to alter or create ways to be on those planets where it is viable? Cause I think we're educated enough that there's things as humans right now, like it's too cold, it's too hot. It's too, do you think we will have the capacity to alter it? Yeah, I think so. Me too. And that's it. Like that was it. That's the whole thing for me on this subject. Yeah. Like I think you affirmed your actual in-depth optimism there. Yeah, sure. This concept that I sit here today and I know everything that the human species is capable of over the next 400 years. In a world where we just invented the internet recently. In a world where we invented electricity. In a world where we invented dams. Like why on Earth are humans not capable of continuing to grow out of necessity potentially, environmentally, or out of curiosity exploring, which is our fucking gift. Yeah. Why on Earth would we not figure it the fuck out? It seems too obvious to me on that, than what most people think is the alternative. They're using the logic of what they know now. Yes, I understand right now it's not clear to you how we're gonna go up to the moon and fucking chill. But it wasn't clear to people how they were gonna leave their continent 500 years ago. Yeah, I agree. I agree. And I think that's like a really big thing I admire about you because you have these visions of the near future that are really difficult to express. And 10 years from that declaration, it seems like really actual. Like for example, I don't know how this cartoon is called in English, but in Spanish it's supersonico, which is the Flintstones and the guy from the future. Yes, the Jetsons. The Jetsons, yes. There's something called retrofuturism, which means that it's kind of like exploring the path that we didn't travel. Like if you see the visions of back to the future of the Jetsons, it's kind of like a childish dream. But you don't get that with your visions. That's really big, especially now. I don't like to guess. Yeah. I'd rather say nothing. And I just think that there's, you know, back to intuition and improvisation, certain things come natural to me when it comes to humans. I think again, one of the great things about getting older, one of the, you know, I brought it up again, I'll bring it up again. One of my dreams for heaven is you get the answers to everything. You know, I think we all have skills and talents and I definitely feel like I have a very special relationship with humans. I feel very connected to the other 8 billion of them. I like them. Yeah. You know, I believe in them. I believe in us. I watch so many people who are literally scared of every other person. And it makes, it breaks my heart. Do you know that I often say, Dustin's about to laugh, I always talk about like, I don't like dogs. And it's an inside joke to myself because what it represents for me is that people blindly love dogs. Yeah. But they don't blindly love people. And I wish it was the other way around. Why do you think that happens? Because of the media, because of the politicians the division, the polarization. The media and politicians have always been around. I think parenting, DNA, how animals work were animals. Like, I think there's a lot there. But I think that, I will say this, and I've been spending time on this with myself, cynicism and anger and fear and darkness is easy. Sure. Optimism and hope and love is hard. So I think a lot of people just choose the easy path. Yeah, sure. It's easier to go and destroy somebody's sandcastle, but it's way harder to build your own, right? I believe in it the most, brother. Yeah. My favorite, it's fun to say this with this view. I always say, I'm sure it sounds like you've listened to me enough to, I've heard this before, but for people listening for the first time. There's two ways, a different way to say it. There's two ways to build the biggest building in town. Build it. Or build a little one and tear everyone else's down. And a lot of people choose the latter. And that's unfortunate. And then people get thrown off. Humans are, many humans are not strong enough emotionally, that when they are hurt, they then deploy that as everyone will do that to them. Yeah. And they close up. For me, when people hurt me, when people have bad intent towards me, I view them as an enigma, an anomaly, a rarity. And I believe in that. I also think that you have a really valuable skill in the future that is this intuitiveness, but it's an informed intuitiveness. Because your process of, for example, the process of creating ads that you share in your book, that first start with organic content that perform well in social media. Like it's an intuition, but it's like somebody that did his homework and then uses that information to make these observations, right? Yeah, there's momentum. Like I always had the intuition, but the experience and the pattern recognition and the momentum and then that deep trust. I trust my intuition in a way that I know most don't. And I wish they did. For me, here's why. When I trust my intuition, it's always a winning outcome, even if it's a losing outcome. Yeah. This goes into self-esteem. This is why I talk so much about it. If I worried about what everybody thought about me, I would do nothing. And that's why so many people do nothing. They worry about judgment of others. It's one thing to worry about your parents or your significant others or somebody who admires judgment. But there's people that are scared of strangers' judgment. And it's really hurt the world. Yeah, this confidence that you have is because you pursue what really interests you and you have the guts to fail with your own idea. Because this term intuition is like a really complicated one because if you're not all in with your intuition, you in a way outsource success to somebody else. Yes. And you need to be in control of that. So even if you fail, it's a successful outcome because you're in control of your next step. It's so well said, my friend. But there's another part of the meal. There's a very key ingredient to make all this work, humility. Yeah. You know, none of that would work if I wasn't accountable to when I'm wrong. One of the quickest ways I know that somebody will be limited in their achievements is predicated on how much they blame others. Yeah. Or they complain. Yeah, there's actually a quote here that says, the one person you need to hold accountable is you. I agree. That's accountable and one of my favorite VVV friends. This room is called accountable and I believe accountability is the precursor to happiness. I believe it is foundational to happiness. I think when sometimes people hear me say that, they think of themselves right now and they're at home beating themselves up. You're not being accountable. You're being unfair to yourself. Accountable is accepting the truth after the fact. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like I tried to do this, it didn't work. I could blame Dustin, but I hired Dustin to film it. I could blame Dustin, but I could have looked at the edit if this video, like once you're just always knowing that it's you, it gets good. Yeah. You know? Cause then you don't feel like someone else is in control. Yeah, I agree 100%. And you need to build like this architecture of your life that you can hold yourself accountable. And I think a big part of it, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, is to build metrics that depend on your work and not on other people. Like for example, if you start a podcast, one big goal could be make it to 100 episodes instead of making to a million subscribers or followers because it depends on your work. And you create a life that with your work, you can win. Because then it's another person's game or there's this external influence, which obviously you prefer, like you prefer to have success. You prefer to do. How old are you? I'm 31. You got your shit together, brother. Thank you. You know, and I see it because I remember being 31 and understanding this too. Now you have the luxury of a lot more information than I had at 31. I wish. And I don't like using that sentence, but it would have been great. Forget about I wish, cause I don't even like it. It would have been wonderful if I grew up in the era, like it's so advanced on how you're thinking. And I had that naturally at a mother that I think was a huge impact. And it just came natural to me. But yeah, man, if you know, I really hope that you get great success because then you'll have influence. And I hope that kids listen to you. Thank you, brother. I read your last book for this interview. I read also your jab, jab, jab, right hook because I heard in the introduction that it was like a prequel to the book, no? Yeah, day trading attention originally was called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook. It's both books we're trying to accomplish the same thing, which is talk deeply about why organic social media content matters. Yeah. I actually heard the audiobook version and I was impressed about the improvisation skills. Oh, when I call, yeah. Is that like an always on part of your life? Yes, it might be my biggest. Yeah. Yeah. Very much. It's how my sense of humor is. It's more improv than stand up. It's a big part of my creative process. And yes, what you got to see that day was how many of the best things that have ever happened to me have happened. You know, I sense something. It could happen to me during this interview. Actually happens a lot when I'm interviewed because questions are taking me down different paths that I'm taking my own self. Yeah. Yeah, I actually got really inspired by that because I have published two books and I was thinking about making the audiobook version and I actually fell in love with that version because it was like a podcast. 100%. Yeah. You would be great at it. And since the early days, you were like that? Like since... As a child even? Yeah. Yeah. I was very disruptive in class because if I had an idea, even if my teacher was presenting, I just never was able to contain my enthusiasm, my passion, and I've always allowed it. I didn't want to contain it. I think today in society through medicine and through parenting and through society, we try to contain art. I think it's a huge mistake. Yeah, and I think it's an essential part of keeping the artistic process alive. Like I'm a really big David Lynch fan. Yes. And I've heard interviews about his creative process and he calls them happy accidents when those kind of eureka moments happen, like on site. I don't even, to your point, it's funny where we're going with this. I don't even think about it any other way. I actually think scheduled or structured creative brainstorms by nature have already eliminated the opportunity for it to be truly creative. Yeah. And how do you professionalize that? Because it's maybe structure is sometimes like a necessary process to become a professional at certain... I think that's very well said. The way I do it is through culture. Okay. So what I mean by that is to your point, I have a 2,500 person global marketing company that only scheduleizes its brainstorming and things of that nature, but the culture of eliminating fear is actually the single most important variable of creativity. Okay. So let's break that down. The real artists of the world, in whatever genre, they're less scared. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a really important part in social progression to have that artist mindset because I was watching a couple of months ago this really cool documentary of Netflix that I don't remember how it's called, but it documents the studio life of this really big artist. And there was this girl called Nettie Oxman. And she had like this graph that tried to represent human progress. And it all started with art because art usually asks like the questions about what's next and they don't necessarily have the skills or the knowledge to materialize it, but they think outside of the box. Once the artist asked that question, it's then the job of science to provide like the building blocks of the idea. And then it turns down to engineering and then it eventually turns out to design. And then the design is the input for the new generation of artists to start the cycle of all over again. So you need that artistic mindset to think forward, right? Yeah. I mean, for the way I see the world is math and art are foundational and incredibly special. And some people over index very heavily to one side or the other. My great gift that I'm thankful for is I think I blur those lines. I value both very much. And to double click into what you just said, that's exactly right. I mean, there's a re, if black and white ruled the world, everything would be figured out. Yeah. So to me, the gray, the art is profoundly important and really so much of our passions as human beings sit in art. And art comes in so many shapes and forms. Not just the way most people think about them. You know, food. I think for us, we've all lived in an era where food is art. Yeah. Like we respect chefs today. 50 years ago, the chefs were help. Yeah, sure. Look down on. So I think we keep evolving and understanding art. And yeah, I mean, it's, I agree that it is, it is probably the most wonderful currency in our society. And there's like a potential to find a canvas in every form of work. Do you think so? 100%. Like everybody can find the artistic value in their own work. Oh gosh. I mean, my sense of art is pretty broad. Like I think it is, I think the way I manage people is art. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. How do you build this sense of culture? Because I've been following you for a couple of years and you're like these boys sometimes inside my head. Like you have these phrases that eventually I think about it, especially when I had an agency in Mexico. How do you build that sense of culture? I think by taking on the responsibility that you work for everybody and not that they work for you. Okay. I think the reason I've been able to do things is real leadership is to make it good for them. Not for your pocket. So I think intent, it starts with intent. Do you want to have a good culture? Or do you say it and not mean it? And what you want to do is have a good P and L. You know, if you're gonna invest in culture when you manage a lot of people, it's gonna come at the expensive profit. Sure. You know? And so, and that'll mean like you throw parties and you have a foosball table in your office. I mean, the grace and patience you give employees to get there instead of firing them costs a lot of money. I can't even comprehend how many tens of millions of dollars I've lost by giving people more room over the last 30 years to have them not deliver. But it has a higher impact on the overall culture when you're a place that tries to be like that. And how do you like verbalize all that, all that that you said, like in a business perspective, like how do you convince everybody that that's the right path to follow because you had a lot of success with this mindset. But how can you pursue or persuade, sorry, everyone else that that's the way to go? By not having passion on persuading or convincing. I'm not in the convincing business. I'm in the conviction business. I don't control the other man and woman on the other side of this podcast. I can only speak from the happiness and the joy and the truth that I live. And I'm aware that it may impact someone in a way. But I think when people get focused on convincing and persuading that that is ego. I have no interest in everybody doing it my way or believing in my way. I have interest in over sharing it with the hope that it brings other people joy at the same level that it's brought me joy. Yeah, it's like a stoic perspective. That you're only responsible for what you can say but not what others can interpret. I also think, yes, and I also think it's the most common. To me, sometimes what makes, when I hear stoic or stoicism, it makes me smile because in my brain, I think of it sometimes as common sense. In what world do I have control over you? Yeah. I think people are very insecure. And I worry about that. And I think Gary V exists because I hate insecurity. You know, I want to champion people to get more confident, to be more happy. But I am not audacious enough to think that I've got it figured out. I'm just passionate to over communicating what I see. You're also a really intuitive guy, like in the best sense of the word. I read your jab, jab, jab, right hook. Yes. I read some bold predictions that turn out to be like really, really right. I know that you've never described them as predictions. You just describe them as observations. Because you're really like in the bleeding edge of the... I can do it right now, virtual influencers, social shopping, like it's all happening right now. But I'm so in it, I just see it earlier a lot of times than the 99%. Yeah, you were actually a really big voice in my conscience because I missed the TikTok wave early in the day. Yes. But right now I'm really into the AI wave. Coming back to this improvisational nature, I'm also a really big fan of your talks. I'm a speaker as well. And you've influenced me a lot because you have this reverse engineering process with the audience which I find fascinating. Because it makes every talk kind of different because you're like responding to the audience feeling. Yes, I use it, that's right. How, like when did it all started? Because it takes a lot of... Right away. I had like the really static talk and then I took the leap of faith and I like if Gary V does it, I can do it as well. And I started doing it and right now I have so much fun in this public event. And it's better, right? It's a lot better. You grow a lot actually. Look, so here's probably the most flattering thing that has ever happened in my career. I had never done television. Wine Library TV pops off in 2007 and I get invited to do the Conan O'Brien show. This is at the height of late night television in America in 2007. We don't pre-rehearse. I did not know that that was unusual. Later I did Ellen DeGeneres, later I did the Today Show, later I did a lot of TV and they would always rehearse our thing. Conan didn't because he's an improv, he's a writer, he's a fucking genius. I go and do the thing. You can find it on YouTube anybody, just type in Gary Vaynerchuk, Conan O'Brien. And it's fucking fire. Like I don't love to get, like I let others give me love. I'm confident and I'll talk in a certain way but I won't say that I'm a baby. But it was good, right? And it's funny and the time, like what you've observed, the timing's right and it's straight fucking improv. Like at the highest level. America's watching, there's a studio and I've never done television. At the height of it. First thing I've ever done. That's crazy. And it kills. It's the last segment of the show. It ends, he goes, good night America. Thanks Gary, good night America. Show ends and he turns to me and he goes, where do you do comedy? And I'm like, no, no, no, I'm a wine guy. And he said, get the fuck out of here. I don't think I understood how smart Conan was and how like respected in comedy, improv writing. I didn't really know yet at the time. It's one of the greatest compliments I've ever been given. One of the really profoundly talented, you know comedians of a generation from a writing, from an improv standpoint on one interaction with me, thought I was a comedian. And so to answer your question, similar to that night, I think maybe a year earlier was the first time I gave a speech down in Florida, it was immediate. The first keynote I ever gave was in that style. I have never in my life prepped, had slides. Now as you know, cause you listen a lot, it's not that I have a canned speech, I have things that are in my mind in periods of time. If I'm speaking a lot of this. You have like riffs, no? Yeah, I have riffs because they're there and they're real. And some of them are jokes and I'll go to them. But yes, I think one of the reasons I've had a big speaking career is I'm contextual. If I go to Mexico right now and go give a talk, I'm gonna make references to maybe what they did in the World Cup or what's happening in popular culture in a novella or like, you know, I'm going to, I'm contextual and then I'm contextual to the audience. If I'm speaking to a bunch of roofers, that's different than me speaking to a bunch of CMOs. If I'm speaking at a collectibles conference, that's different than I'm speaking to a B2B SaaS industry. And I have such a wide breadth of knowledge because I'm a practitioner that I'm always ready to speak. Yeah, I think you're contextual, but without losing your essence. And you're also really good at recognizing patterns, which I think that's the essence of intelligence. Like it's maybe a really systematic approach to intelligence, but I really believe that intelligence is recognizing patterns. And you're really good at perceiving people and acting upon it, right? Yeah, I trust, yes, thank you. Yes, there's probably nothing I trust more than my initial read on a human being. What detonated that approach to life? Like, was it your parents, your education? I think it was my circumstance. I think, you know, first, I think my mother has a lot of it. You know, it's really funny when I think about my mother and father, I really genuinely do have. It's crazy, like, and it's a joke in my family. The analogy is that because I was first, I got to pick all the best things. You know, I really am no question my mother, father's son. Like, and like just the sheer best versions of them. Both my parents have tons of great qualities. Both my parents have shortcomings. I really took a lot of their best qualities. That's number one. Number two, my upbringing. I got very fortunate that I grew up with little. You know, I'm an immigrant. I was born in the Soviet Union. Not a great place to be born. Came to America in the late 70s. A bad time in America, especially in New York. It was like ghetto. You know, where we lived in Queens, it was like, you know, and then New Jersey and good diversity and 80s. You'd go outside and play for 12 hours a day. And like, I was a grown up at eight years old. I literally went outside and lived life. Like my mom knew I was outside, but she didn't know where I was, so you just matured differently. I was the oldest of three kids. I was parented by my mother who's amazingly emotionally intelligent. So not only did I have the natural ingredients, but then the fucking cook cooked it, right? Just a lot of things went well. When did you started with your father's business of wine? When I was 14. When you were 14? Yes. You had like, how different was it the approach from the one that you sharing your book or you recommend in your book of like, for example, if you have a roofing business that you do it in secret, was it kind of like that? But obviously in another era or in another? Yeah, you mean in convincing my father to do it. Yeah, like you started doing things in secret to help the business or was it like? Yeah, it was, I would say this, to my father's credit. He supported a lot. I earned that in the first two years. The first two years I worked my face off, I'm 14, 15, 16. I'm working 12 hours a day. And then I'm selling wine as 16. And you have a young face I used to? He has a young face. He's the number one. He's Dustin's number one. We're pointing to Dustin who's fucking 40. It looks like he's 25. But when I was 15, I looked seven. You know, when I was 19, I was 13. So at that point in my life, I looked even younger than I was. So I was 15, looking 11, and people are coming in and buying alcohol. Yeah, that's crazy. And I'm like, oh, you should buy this. You should buy, it was, the great sadness of my life as there's no footage of this, it has to be ridiculous. So I gained my dad's trust on being good in the first couple years. And then by the time I'm 16, 17, he just trusts. And he said yes to most things. And the things he said no to, yeah, I did them out of his vision and then showed him it worked and did it. We're now in VaynerMedia. Yes. VaynerMedia was a consequence of this wine store. And your YouTube career or your social media career was a consequence of VaynerMedia, or how was that chronology? Yes, I started doing YouTube in 2006, right? When it came out, February 2006, it came out in 2005, mid-2005. So within the first year, it exploded. I was good at it, it worked, it helped the business. And then Twitter came out and I was fast on Twitter and then Facebook. And so my career was always about marketing, but this was the era of 2006 where it was about personal marketing. That gave me leverage to have people interested in me, which allowed me to listen to the market and know they needed my skills to do what I was doing for my father's business, but for the biggest companies in the world. And so VaynerMedia came out of me being a marketer for my dad's business, but realizing that it was gonna become the most important marketing in the world, and that Starbucks and Nike and BMW were gonna need it. Yeah. It's incredible the difference between the marketing or marketing right now and in the 70s and 80s. I know you said. Even in the early 2000s. Like it's so much complicated right now. Oh, I wish I could be Don Draper. Yeah. You know, I wish I could come up, I have a lot of ideas. You have ideas. Yeah, yeah, sure. Like going into a room and selling someone on believing in my idea would have been the best. And then going in the middle of the day and getting a cocktail and becoming, I would have been the best. Or having this sense of stability that you know that these ideas could maybe work in six months. I mean, it was unbelievable. What we're in now, the merit, where the math shows you if you were good at creative or not because of the algorithms, that's a different game. But luckily I've been training for this game for over a decade. So we're in a good position. Do you think the reward is as well exponentially bigger right now? Yeah, I do. It's also potentially very low cost. Yeah, that's crazy. One clip from this for you could result in doubling your audience. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. What advice would you give me? I have this podcast Col creativo. I have found success in Mexico. I'm over 500 episodes in this podcast, but I wanna start breaking the American media. I already have my working visa. I'm gonna come to the States probably next year. You don't have to give advice to somebody who knows what to do. You're doing it right now. Just knock on doors and... We are in you breaking into the US market. You're my first guest in English, we are in the moment right now. This is the meta of you executing on your vision. You're no dummy. You didn't get here by accident. Me saying yes to this interview, you're gonna leverage that to completely penetrate the entire market. I appreciate your yes by the way. I was happy to do it. I go back to intuition. I get a lot of these. There are something just smelled right. How do you continue to find interesting this career because you've done it for so long? Because I have interest in building the building. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's interesting because you describe yourself as a serial entrepreneur. And that tells me that you are in love with the game. You're also a serial social media creator because you're contextual with the way you express yourself in different platforms. Have you fallen in love with the social media game similarly to the entrepreneurship game? Or is it part of the big game? I think it started as being part of the big game. But I think I love the craft of it as well. I was always aware that if I built a personal brand that that would be a leverage point for growth. It's called, I love when people are like, oh, so personal brand, it's so yucky. I'm like, reputation. Yeah. People get so caught up in words. I knew having a big and good reputation would be good for business. No figure. I think it started off as me knowing that it would be valuable for my entrepreneurial career. But I think I now enjoy the craft of the creativity, the science, the strategy similar to the way I enjoy being an entrepreneur. I'm also very interesting. I probably love being COO as much as I love being CEO. Okay. So one of my shortcomings potentially is that I spent too much time being COO because I love operations too. I enjoy all of it. Yeah, I have the same problem. I really love the creative process and the technical process of this podcast, but you only have so much hours and you only have so much willpower and money. No matter how fucking amazing you are, no matter how many hours, that's right. I also like that by dedicating yourself to build this personal brand in a way, you also incentivize yourself to build a better you. Like you not only grow professionally, but you also grow personally with each new experience. That makes it addictive. Like for me, I sometimes live experiences for the podcast or for, which is my way of verbalizing my interest, but for me, it's actually like this virtual cycle of, 100% I get better to perform better, so I get better to perform better. I'm a buyer of that. Yeah. How about physical health? You're also in really good health. Does that come into the equation of the business performance? No, I think that's more about life. Okay. You know, I don't think I'm in good health because I want to work forever, though I want to work forever. It's more than I don't want to die. You know, like I love life so much. Work is a big part of that, but I also love my leisure. I love my family. I love build. Like so, you know, I think the person, the health is not the driver of business. Though one of my favorite clips of me on the internet is a kid asking me, "'Gary, how do you factor health into your business?' And my answer was I was walking in the Super Bowl and I said to him, "'Well, if you're dead, you're out of business.'" And I've always laughed about that. And it came very naturally. It was a fun improv moment. But I think I do health because I'd like to see my grandchildren. Like I want to live, why wouldn't, if you like life, why wouldn't you want to live as long as possible? Yeah. You know? And you know, I think some of us have such passion for what we do. I feel like if I was out of shape and not as healthy, I would still have the adrenaline and the passion to work as much. Yeah. I would live as long. And I prefer to live longer. Yeah, sure. I agree. How do you talk to yourself like in private, like for example, I'm often, yeah? But how's the like the tone? It's a love affair. Yeah. It's a love affair in the way that I think I talk to the world. I think the way you see me show up is what's going on with me too. Which is, I'm like, if I'm a cheerleader for Dustin, well, of course I'm a cheerleader to myself. But I'm also telling myself, I enjoy a good, this actually happened very recently. Maybe this week or was it last week? I was in the bathroom in our office. I was thinking about something. I got to the mirror, watched my hands and I look at myself and I like, I razzed myself. Like literally physically looked at myself. I'm like, don't be a fucking idiot. Yeah. You know, it's like fun. I have a very nice relationship with myself. And it is actually my, it's one of my deepest sadness that I know so many don't. Yeah, you need to know how to talk to yourself and how do you respond to certain kinds of tones. Like I talk to myself like a boxer, like if I'm my own coach, because I respond well to that. Yeah, I respond well to that, but there are some people that don't. Yeah, I think sometimes on my father to myself, sometimes on my cheerleader, sometimes on my guidance coach or, like there's a lot of versions, but all of it is so warm and well intended. Yeah. How do you deal with success? Because it's one thing that I've noticed in this talk is that you don't stay a lot in your successes because you're moving forward. Like how do you deal with success? Do you move on quickly? Yeah, too fast actually. I'm trying to be a little bit better. My brother razzes me quite a bit of like, can you fucking take a second to smell the rose? But for me, the rose doesn't smell good. The putting the seed into the soil to grow the rose. Now that manure that I plant the rose in, that smells good to me. I like the shit. Yeah, the really good part of enjoying your day to day is that the process is the reward. 100%. I'd like to be a little bit better, more for the memories. Yay, we sold a comfort door. I've had some remarkable things happen that, it's almost humorous now that I'm sitting here and thinking about it. I've had some pretty big stuff happen where I'm not sure I'm spending even a fucking minute on it. You've seen it, Thust. But I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't think that makes me a sicko or fucked up. I'm a little detached from my success. That's like over here. It's almost like a shelf of trophies. Like, I don't know, it's got dust on it. Like, I don't think I shine my trophies. You know? Yeah, and I totally identify with that. Like, I'm a really big poker player, poker fan, and I approach poker like really mathematically, and you cannot feel so bad for losing a big hand if you did the right decision and vice versa. Like, you cannot feel so good. Well, that goes, right, so good if you played it loose. Yeah. I like that. I'm very similar. That's why I tell everybody to die on their own sword. Okay, yeah. You know, I love that saying. Don't let somebody else dictate. Like, don't make a decision based on someone like you. On your own terms. That's why I like, when I lose a hand in poker, and I'm not actually a very good poker player, I'm enough to be dangerous. Yeah, just like, dwelling is just not something I think is a great trait. Yeah. Dwelling is very poisonous. Yeah, I agree. It gets you to the wrong state of mind to analyze your next decision. Like, if you're playing golf, and you had a really bad hold, you need to move on. Like, that's not... And in sports, I'm like that. I'm actually, in sports, I can get very caught up. I saw you had a black guy like a couple of months ago. I took an elbow in basketball. In sports, I get very un-tilted. I can lose my way. I let my, in business and life, emotion is really under control. In sports, it's out of control. But you need to have a vessel for your emotion. So you use your sports, right? I think the New York Jets is my great vessel. All that disappointment, all that negativity, they actually play. You can see, I don't know if you know this. You see where the lights are very far away? Oh yeah. That's where the New York Jets play. That's the stadium. That's the stadium. That place drives me fucking crazy. That place, I'm overly emotional, but you've got it very much figured out. I think people like me, it seems like you, others, they have some sort of vessel for that. And mine, thank God, is sports. It's not politics. It's not family members. It's something that's silly. I think it's structured super right. I think giving a fuck about something that much, that actually means nothing is wildly healthy, especially when it doesn't affect anybody else. It's kind of poetic that you could see here the yet stadium. It's like your Polar Star. It's literally a very big part of me. The Jets are there. My other favorite team is the Knicks. It's my office there. And then if we go over there, the Statue of Liberty is there, and that represents a lot to me. I'm a very pro America. I'm not naive that America has shortcomings, but so does everybody. Yeah, who's awesome. Like, what, Mexico, Russia, China, Sweden, France. Like, you can't be a country and not have many shortcomings, but I don't own a couple. But yeah, I love this office because I get to see a lot of the things that matter to me. Yeah, and if you have love for yourself, you need to have love for the environment that created you. Like, that's an essential part of... Well, that goes into like, you know, I wish, I think another thing that I'm spending a lot of time in late nights, in showers, in airplanes, in moments of silence. I wish people had better relationships with their parents. Yeah. And I want to give their parents more grace. I said something at Vekon once that said, it was called, said the line was, I just want you to all know, if you're upset with your parents, like, fuck your grandparents. And the point was, there's so many people that are mad at their mom, they know their grandma. Yeah. They know what their grandma did to their mom, but they like their grandma because their grandma didn't do that to them. Sure. But they're mad at their mom. But the grandma created the mom. Like, I don't think we need, we do not leave enough grace for our parents' mistakes. We are, I think, in general, humans do not have the right relationship with their judgment of their parents. I totally agree. And you come, eventually, to an age that you are the age of when your parents had you. Like, I'm the age of when my parents had me as a baby. And you start to humanize your parents, and that's a big part of life, understanding and humanizing them. And it goes, it makes sense, right? Because when you idolize your parents, as so many of us do when you're two, four, six, seven, you go through this transition when you're like, wait a minute, my parent is a human? Yeah. Wait a minute, my parent really made these mistakes? Wait a minute, my parent made this terrible mistake? And you take them off this pedestal that you put them on and fucks it all up. But to your point, then you come back around. Yeah, I just have incredible grace for my parents. And I think that's a big part of my happiness. Are you nostalgic about your past? Because I'm having the same reflection about my parents in the recent years, and I appreciate them right now. But that comes also with a nostalgia of my childhood of the other days. Yeah, I think I do. I think I have it. I'm very fond of my childhood. Yeah, I like it. What are you interested in right now? A lot. I mean, you know, I'm always interested in maximizing joy and impact in my life. I'm incredibly interested. This is, I can feel myself smiling. Let me not use interested. I am getting more confident that I'm gonna turn V-Friends into a Pokemon like Marvel-like brand. That has me very happy. It's gonna take me another 20 years, but I smell it. So that's exciting, has me interested. Live social shopping has me infatuated. The QVC of vacation of social media. Food. Food, yeah, I love food. You know, in a couple different ways, you know, my fiance is an incredibly educated expert in clean living. So not just food, but chemicals. Like my deodorant that I use right now has no chemicals in it. The first two weeks I used it, I was scared to be around people because it didn't fucking work. And just watching my body adjust to it has been fascinating to me. So your body adjusts to the deodorant? Mm-hmm. Oh, I didn't know that. And, you know, deodorant's pretty interesting because it's really going in you. Yeah. So, you know, Mona's definitely been a huge impact on my curiosity and interest on cleaner eating, cleaner living. I think people are gonna, I'm excited for gut health, intuition, the gut. Yeah. As an overall thing, the gut. Both in gut health, a lot of people around the world take medicine that they don't have to if they understood the gut because the gut is so important. And then what we talked about earlier, back to creative. Yeah, sure. Like I'm infatuated and genuinely interested in gut, intuition and gut health. Yeah, that's really interesting because some things that we verbalize in a way, like in the 80s, in the 70s, with technology, it has changed drastically. Like for example, my, what we're about to be done? Yeah, can't believe how fast it went. Yeah. Holy shit. Yeah, well Gary, for me it has been- No, no, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. I wanna make, did you touch on everything you wanted? Yeah, sure, I actually touched on even more topics. It was an improvisational talk. And I really appreciate it. The biggest compliment I can give you is the fact that this was an hour and it really, like I literally looked at it and I was, I thought we had a whole another half an hour. Only speaks to how enjoyable this was for me, so thank you.
