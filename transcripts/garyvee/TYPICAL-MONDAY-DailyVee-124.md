This is me, how many of you are asking me what I'm gonna do when I hit a million followers on Instagram? Nothing. Haven't you been paying attention? I don't give a fuck. Sorry. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? I don't know. I'm gonna go back. Like there needs to be an FBC, Facebook commercials. Everybody in the room, you have to stop playing. We have an incredible meeting. Punchline is I've done a lot of things over the last eight weeks to not only, I think, get the organization here to at least, I think at all hands on, where it's like this. And then it changes this week. And like, fuck. I'm more excited about making it a bigger thing than they did before. And if they put time, money, and resources behind it, it will be a thing. I'm Steve Babcock. I'm the Chief Creative Officer at VaynerMedia. And I've been here for 10 months. 10 whopping months. It's been really, really good in that it's been really challenging, but in a good way, I think. It wasn't built with the emphasis on what that thing, it was built on the placement of that thing. Really, really good understanding the platforms, understanding the behaviors, understanding the tricks, the hacks, all these great things. Such an efficient place for performance marketing through the social channels. And so I got really excited about the opportunity to come in and hopefully influence and add that layer of emphasis on the creative product. I still want you to feel that we need to go fast. So it'll be amazing if you feel that you have to find something, but it's not at heart. It's like. What are you acting right now? And yeah, I thought you don't get a black coffee. Little black coffee? Cool. My sweetheart. Ooh, wow. Does Reg look unbelievable in the holiday card? Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Yours are gorgeous. I had gorgeous gorgeous. Really? Yeah, I like it. How great is this view? Huh? Astronaut Boxing. What? Astronaut Boxing. That's so crazy. That's what I'm going to do with my next, I'm going to start that, but I'm going to go crazy. I'm going to box seven days a week. I'm going to box. I think I'm actually going to have a fight at 45. Maribel is one of the four members of a new office I've created called Office of the CEO. And basically is everything that is just scaling. This is how I'm rolling now, because above and beyond a Mark Evans or a Brandon, somebody on a piece of business, there's so much macro, especially where I think this conversation is going to go. It's been unbelievable helpful. I'll let Maribel tell you a little better about herself. My name is Maribel Lara. I've been at Vayner two and a half years on the account strategy side. So most recently I was VP of US accounts for ABI, but for the bulk of my time here, I was predominantly on the PepsiCo portfolio working on brands like Quaker. And before being at Vayner, I worked at Group M, where I work for a small agency called M80 that was part of it. It's social media marketing. And the fun thing about me is that I didn't work in marketing at all before that. So for seven years, I worked in higher ed administration. So college student services. I worked at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in California in residential life. My last full-time job in higher ed was at Barnard College, where I was director of college activity. So I was at Barnard when Facebook launched. And at the same time, I was considering a career change. And I saw how quickly Facebook changed the way that students were communicating with each other. So I was like, there's something to this. And I had made a decision to go back to school full-time for my MBA. So in focusing in marketing, wherever I could, I focused on social media. That's the crazy part. What I'm about to paint you is do that. Do pictures. Analyze the data. Do commercials. Analyze the data. Check it. Correct. And when all nine pieces are all collectively less expensive than the three pieces that you guys have done in your world. Pay somebody for the insights. Go have a big and expensive video. Go have a media agency planet that doesn't have your best interest in mind. You have three separate expensive pieces versus nine pieces that are less cost-acrossed individually. And then that's the game. Do you know how many people ask me on a daily basis, what would I do with $2,500? So this happens a million times a day. And my answers are either A, buy Amazon or Facebook stock, or B, go buy shit and flip it on eBay, get to $50,000, and then do something. A version of that for stock and its historical safety and growth of dotlack, there's real stuff. Great. I'm very excited. Yeah, good. OK. Thank you. Give Lizzie my best. I will. Did you see my Giants yesterday? You know what's funny? I'm in the best mood. Yes, but even better. Even better. I didn't watch any football. I'm not watching any football. No, I'm watching none of them. I'm done. And so you have to understand, it's almost as if the Giants and dolphins weren't in the playoffs themselves. Put the 500 fucking hashtags that matter most of my world and have a human every second, fucking clicking them, looking at the accounts, DMing them, and like, who are the people, what are the people, my people, like, all of it? Yeah. I'm just, how you doing? Good, brother. How are you? Good. I just wanted to check. Good? As you should? Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah. Everybody's going to get recalibrated to that new game. But yeah, man, I mean, look, I think the good news is you've earned a lot of opportunity more than happy to listen to anything I can bring you value. I think the thing that I want to give you is the thing you've earned, which is flexibility. I don't know how to tell you. This is all the stuff that we talked about three years ago. We're like, hey, you eat shit and it returns bigger value. Nobody's going to live in a place where you're not you know, there's nobody's going to lose this game in a seven or 10 year window. And it starts manifesting. What's cooking? What do you guys jam in on anything good? All I care about in the world is Facebook commercials. I genuinely don't care about anything else. Wait, don't tell me you're using C-word. Yeah, yeah. Just so you know, just like the holding company clarification, like, by the way, I'll use any word. I just want people to understand what I'm saying. I need to basically know what freedom we have to do that with her and I need to get her in a room and pitch and tell me where the brand's sitting. I just want to what I want to do, especially at our three levels is force them into the system. Yeah, we've got her in a good spot. I think a lot of what they're struggling with right now is how it ladders up. Look what's going on now, guys. All right, boys. You know what happened? DRock showed up on video. I'm going to reverse it now. Watch this traumatic DRock is leaving the wow. To me, that's the ultimate difference is that we have to stop using commercials to tell a story. It just has to be interesting. It has to be something that's relevant. That's crazy. That's wild. Well, for an industry that for so long influenced culture so profoundly, right? I mean, you were either the news. You were Hollywood or you were a madman. Like, there was the power to create the stuff that influenced culture. And now we live in a world where everyone is given the tool to publish and it's blurry and it's murky. I find it interesting that a lot of the ad world is behind. A lot of the ad world is the mom and dad at the party. Facebook video represents the opportunity to be more exploratory and to just try things and do things because that's what it is. It wasn't born with a set of rules. It wasn't like you got to do it this way and this way and this way and this way. There are best practices that may or may not apply. But I think first thing first, you have to have a hook. You have to have. That is an interesting story. If it's not interesting, then it's what's the point? Like, it has to be more than ever because you're competing with everything on the internet. So it has to be interesting. It has to be interesting very quickly. And then you as a creative have to be willing to optimize. You have to be willing to recut. You have to be willing to take the thing you thought was going to be interesting. And then once you find out it wasn't interesting because the market told you so, you have to be willing to go, well, what can I do with that footage? Can I DJ it to become the? I was trying that being like. It's a very different mindset. Let's not go in anywhere. These headphones are good. I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm pretty excited about it. That was very clear. There's no string. I'm still going to lose them. But not really. It looks ridiculous. But it's going to become social norm. Like everything else. It's really good, actually. I love the more. I think there's a lot of other things that happened here. Very much like I say publicly for the last decade, I believe in the jockey a lot of times and not just the horse. My strategy is reverse engineering them. Always over communicating. I'm sitting in a car right now with three top talents, four top talents. And truth is, they all care about different things. And they have different ambitions. They're all A players, but they all have different lives. And different things matter to them. And so I try to communicate with them. And I try to create a world where they feel comfortable communicating to me. And also I recognize one of the top talents. And I want you to spell this all out. One of the top talents, I think, I'm pretty sure, had no kids when he started with us. Now he has two. And that's going to change things that matter. And they're young now and in five years, because I know he'll be here. He may care about different things, because he may decide this was the year he needs to coach. And so I don't know, but there's only one strategy with top talent, which is reverse engineer what they care about and be flexible to adjust what they care about forever. Excuse me, how many of you are asking me what I'm going to do when I hit a million followers on Instagram? Nothing. Haven't you been paying attention? I don't give a fuck. Sorry. Just for clarity, I'm very thankful and grateful, but I'm not going to like, you know, like do a contest to get more followers. People, all these people, you know, I'm massively thankful, but I was grateful at one. Looks. Okay. VaynerMedia230. Vayner. Vayner. Vayner. You are my... I am your... Uh... Yeah, that's me. Gary? Yes, sir. Any chance you could hit up my boy BearCrafted? BearCrafted. BearCrafted. Yeah, what's the story? What do you write? What do you say about my cycling team? What do you say there? Comment on the photo. Tell Gary I've been a practitioner for a while, but people like him make me get through the harder parts of the hub. His name's Cedric? Cedric, yeah. Oh my God, yes. Ben and M, I love you guys. Congrats, congrats, congrats. Can't wait to hang. The amount of people that are gonna make lots and lots of money selling stuff on eBay because of me this year is insane. Actually, go look at this hashtag, 2017 Flip Challenge. No, DRock, I do not. I wanna say how we've created a challenge that is going to help thousands of people make lots of money that's gonna be significant to them, whether to pay off debt or start their business on a ploy against another underpriced opportunity like Facebook ads and Instagram influencers. No, I don't wanna say anything. Great. Right here. Gary V, taking profits and reinvesting to buy sell higher value items with wider margins, turning books into cars. Nice. New York. J. Okolander, no, he's in Ohio. Can't in Ohio. Guys, look at this stuff. These are like, these are like, like these are, this is money that people, and the big thesis right now is sell shit that's randomly sitting in your house. If you guys understood, even in the apartments, like that you're actually sitting with like, especially just trying to, like, you're sitting with like $1900 worth of stuff that's literally going in the garbage. And like what $1900, like, it's real. It's a real thing. What's up guys? Just sitting here, DRock's filming. What is this? Episode 124. Marcus is here, Joe's here, Bradley's here. I got Avi to laugh a bunch today. Anyway, why I'm really here. Decided that I want to post a fan video on Instagram once a day. And so I'll tag their handle, they'll get hugely blown up, we'll get a bunch of different creative, and see different things. We just need to figure out how we're gonna take submissions. And as always, there's always, there's always, yeah, okay, hashtag, good. Hashtag fan V, fan V-E-E. Here we go, that's it, that's how we do it, DRock. Anyway, a lot of it will be crap. That's just the way it is, and I won't use it if it's crap. Won't. But if it's great, we'll pick it. So if you want to make a video, mash up, need anything from me, hit up DRock, make those videos. Like, like it's good. And like now we're trippled down on everything we can help to support. Okay? Basically, you know, taking it from the tippy top, it's gonna be called Crushed It. You know, how these 39 people, Red, you know, did it, and how you can too, right? Like that's kind of the energy of it. So again, from a framework, do we want to start with their story, and with their, you know, obviously we start with me like we always do, and then, you know, you could decide that framework, but I think it's either they're separate, and a separate thing, and we do all the platforms, like, you know, what I would do, best practices, but the framework is, no matter what you are, dancer, singer, painter, want to sell t-shirts, I will synthesize best practices, opportunities on these platforms, from the State of the Union of those platforms, in this book, and then the stories of those people. I think there's a great, wait a minute, by the way, I think there's a great one. There's a very good one, a joke I use a lot, that we're definitely gonna use, which is the only person that I acknowledged in that book, besides my family, is Travis, the co-founder of Uber. So that's a monster, monster one. That'll be fun. Okay. Yes. Ready to rock and roll? Yeah, yeah, I know. One of the vibe differences is speed. Ha ha ha ha. Is that a Sony 87? Self-awareness is the game. I don't think people are listening right now, I love athletics, and I think they're in the job. Gary, man, thanks for doing this, huh? Of course. I really appreciate it. I know what the schedule has been kind of crazy today, so there means a lot, but anyways, I don't want to waste any time, I just want to get ready to help. To be quite honest with you, Gary, I figured the first question I'd ask you would just be a question, a personal question, if you don't mind. Sure. About life, that's what I'm most interested in. Okay. And it's really just, oftentimes, in my household, I wait to feel good to do stuff. I'm a big Tony Robbins fan, you know Tony. I do. Okay, sweet. His whole thing is like, achievement versus development, right? You can do all you want, but if you don't feel good at the end of the day, you end up doing something stupid, like killing yourself, or something even worse. Okay. So my focus on 21 has been honestly just on feeling good, and I've kind of noted that, if I don't feel good, I don't do shit like you, you know? I think that's right. Okay, okay, okay, you think that's right. I'm a big believer in that. Yeah. Which is why I do so much shit, because I feel so good. I'm being serious. Like, I actually think that makes a ton of sense. I think that I didn't do any school work, because it didn't make me feel good, and I didn't feel good then. And since I've been in the real world, I've been able to focus on the things that make me happy, and doing real shit. Like, I couldn't imagine anybody that doesn't go through some version of what you were talking about right now, which is feeling good is the game. And the better you feel, the more you have energy to, either you're on offense or defense. And when you're not feeling good, you're on defense, which means you can't do shit, because you're thinking about dumb shit. Okay. And you're trying to, you know, like, you're dwelling, and you're not focused on being on the offense. So I think that makes a ton of sense, so go ahead. So that's a good play to make, essentially. I mean, it's not just all about like hustling 24-7, just achieving, it's about making sure that inside your heart, you're feeling okay. Yeah, I mean, I think there's, I couldn't imagine anybody in the world disagreeing with like doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff. Here are the things that run through my mind. I would say the primary thing I probably asked myself is this action gonna lead to somebody showing up at my funeral? If you really ask me what the fuck I do for a living, it's that I'm trying to create a legacy because I'm either A, so egotistical that I want that, or B, love human beings so much, because I do, and it's why I think I've popped on social. So I think a lot of what I think about is what's the legacy of this maneuver? Like right now, this is fucking stupid for me. Doing an interview with you for 15 minutes is fucking ridiculous. I love it, I love it. It makes no goddamn sense, but I'm feeling pretty good about the odds of maybe this leading to you showing up to my funeral. Like that's how I think about stuff. So I'm very big on how, what does it impact? How does it impact me and more importantly, the other person in the narrative that I care about, which is I think I was gifted with some real crazy shit. Enough talent to be able to do my thing for me and still have so much left over to give so much. I mean, that to me is crazy. I wish people understood, I wish people understood what I would look like from a business success standpoint if I actually took all this energy and made it selfish. It'd be over already. It would be a game over. Over. I think my thing is very simple. There's never been a day in my life where I've done something with the wrong intent. I want to win and I want other people to win too. So long as the intense, right? You kind of just roll with whatever they're having. 100%. I want to build the biggest building in town. The way I want to do that is by building the biggest building. Not to make people shut down. That's my, I say it all the time because it's the thing that I've seen that separates me, which is a lot of people that are as hungry and as ambitious as I am are insecure in reality. And I'm just not. And of course I have insecurities. For example, I wasn't a thousand percent secure in like getting all the cutest girls I ever saw. That wasn't my strength. But when it comes to business, when it comes to people behavior, I just got it like that. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. You just. Okay. Gary, man. Thanks for everything. All right, cheers, brother. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. So one of the great perks of selling your company to me is courtside seats. At one point. I got a big discount and buying PureWow by offering these courtside seats. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Looks great. We're rolling out. Really? Oh, my gosh. What up guys. Just creating some clarity to what FanV is. It's people who create mashups video content, the stuff that D Rock and other Tyler make. And then we put it out. So if you want to showcase your editing and videos skills. You can take any clips that you Want from my stuff and mash them together. from the podcast and mash them together. You can even once in a while hit me up and I'll do some original to the screen video and send it to you if you gotta wanna get fancy. But you might have to wait, cause it gets busy a little bit. But anyway, that's a little clarification to what FanV is. I'm gonna be showcasing on my page videos from fans that mash up my content, the stuff that I would share to the audience. Kind of like the episode 101, the classic from DailyV, which was done by a fan from Portugal. That kind of stuff for Instagram. One minute video mashups.
