Everyone on earth should try selling on TikTok shop and whatnot just to see if they like it I think that a lot of us love something But we don't know it because we never tried it the real fix for all of you that are stuck is curiosity So many people here are lacking a gene a trait called curiosity Some of them have curiosity, but because you know what beats curiosity unfortunately in some people's body in security I feel like I haven't been productive enough and I feel like I'm kind of making excuses like oh I got time or just not being as productive as I know I could be like I know I could be going harder in the paint I'm just not first of all what's going hard in the paint meaning like what are you trying to build your career a startup? Your personal brand like what are you? What are you trying to go hard at because I could tell you right now? There is nobody that goes weaker in the paint than me when I don't like what the fuck I'm doing Right, and I think I've gotten good with that like I've left toxic environments. I don't do anything that I'm not passionate about So I'm doing what I love But I just I feel like I'm not going as hard because I think it's like the family judgment of like you're not You're not doing it the right way or you're not going down the right path kind of deal All right, so what are you doing and what family members are saying what? Yeah, I got I got on what not you know, I've been having fun with what not I'm actually making You know a decent money like I'm kind of just all in on what not right now. What are you selling? I got like Pokemon cards. I got like v friends Anything you know I go to I go to Goodwill. I'll find like plushies and stuff, you know and flip that so it's been fun What do you want to build? So I want to be a music producer like full-time and I think I was like halfway into it But it would like the money wasn't really there so then that's why I like pivoted and I was like okay I just got it, you know find my own path or like, you know get free. I don't like clocking in nine to five Right, let's break it down even further. How many how many? Hours a day. Do you feel like you're working? No bullshit. Don't bullshit. Don't bullshit me or anybody else. Yeah, like six Yeah, that's fucking ridiculous six is enough if you want to make 30 to $50,000 a year There's probably some sort of path to six and of course The people that will jump in and be like if you create AI agents and efficient you can work one hour a day and make a lot of money I mean like anything's possible, but the way you delivered the six like did not like I think you're you're right The question is I also think you might be using the judgment of your family as an excuse as well And let me say something completely left field like you don't need to build an empire like let me ask you a different question altogether Are you happy? Yeah, like 98 percent Well 98 percent is about fucking 60 percent more than most people on earth. I'm lucky. I'm very lucky Yeah, I mean look, I think you know breaking this down. I mean, there's a lot of different things here. How old are you? 25 So there's a hundred different dynamics in play in this call one you do have time like you could work six hours and Like be 98 like I promise you that 100% of earth would probably sign up for working six hours a day and being 98% happy And that's the beauty of being 25 and five years old in a lot of ways like you know But but I don't fully believe you does that make sense like meaning like like not that I don't believe you I feel what I feel intuitively on this call is you intuitively feel like This is not sustainable like you can't like what you're doing now eventually this you won't be 98% happy You'll be 9.8% happy and you're probably trying to ponder a strategy to eliminate that vulnerability. Yes. No kind of yeah I want to pivot back into music production like I was mentoring people and I was making money But I wasn't making as as much as I'm making on what not if that makes sense Yes, and I think what also makes sense is if you're are do you feel like you're hungry and ambitious or no? I'm pretty hungry. Yeah, I'm pushing yeah I don't agree with you because if you're if I'm listening to you and you're only working six hours a day You have the opportunity to work ten hours a day five hours on what not and flipping and five hours a day on music and Ten hours a day at 25 is a piece of fucking cake Right and if you love them both and if you're 98% happy you would have the energy for that I got the energy. I'm just I think I think I'm just not doing it But why? Again like I'm like nobody in my family has done this what I'm doing so The fuck does that have to do with anything? Which which one of your parents? Were non-supportive and kind of talked down to you My dad great That's the punchline of this whole conversation. You know that right yeah, and the question becomes are you gonna believe him? Or are you gonna fucking stick it to him or the most healthy? Are you gonna be empathetic that one of his parents talked in a negative way to him and completely? Disregard it and live your life the whole time I was just thinking like be the bigger person be the bigger person be the bigger person feel feel bad for your dad Don't feel bad for you feel bad that dad also had a circumstance You know empathy and compassion is an incredibly powerful thing brother one of the things I always rail on and at McVeek on keynote. I once famously said fucking grandparents. Oh, yeah So I really believe in that ship brother like instead of being mad at your parent you can be empathetic to them You can learn the power of forgiveness You can learn the power of perspective I think you're gonna have to attack this that way does that make sense But six hours is not gonna get you to you know financial freedom or building You know that is not an ambitious number. Yeah, so I need to double it 12 Yeah, and honestly, I think you should attack this dad issue whether you can watch this over and over every morning And it reminds you whether you need to go even harder flipping so that you can save up some money to do therapy once a week Whether you read things listen to things like obviously I know the V friends community has been a positive impact on you That's been a foundation. There's more to go though. Like I don't like I'm telling you right now the excuse that your dad You know, nobody's ever done it in my family. That's honestly that has almost no validity None almost everything that has ever happened in life has been based on someone doing something that no one in their family has ever done Right, that's how it works. You know what I mean? That's a that's a bullshit excuse that makes sense appreciate you Gary Love you brother. Stay well. Oh you got rapid fire good McKenzie. Talk to me Rhonda asks how do you choose working on your side hustle instead of having any social life friends? Why does everybody think everything is so absolute? I have 800 side hustles. I have a social life I have a main job. I'm a capable human being when I was building V friends I saw no one including my real job, right? I was all in then I was done then I was back What is a matter with people it is not fully absolute It's not all or nothing and it's not all or nothing Forever you could be all in on something for a while like that young man We just talked to you could do the dad thing for 10 years and then do more creative stuff And by the way notice what else I said about tell me about your Friday night and then on Saturday and Saturday He is doing his creative thing. What do you think is like your backbone for for becoming successful? The inability to listen to anybody else regardless if it's positive or negative. I love that and what platform Do you feel like is your most? profitable platform being on after being on all of the platforms it ebbs and flows You know like that's what's so cool about day trading attention, right? The concept that I wrote my last book about things keep you know Changing you know when I first came out the game search mattered email marketing mattered, you know SEO SEM then it was my space that it was Facebook, you know, they're you know, you stream used to be huge for me Vine used to be important to me like things change, but I think tiktok shop and whatnot. You need to pound both of them But tiktok shop why it's so amazing is you get discoverability Yeah, people just find you whereas whatnot as you're seeing you won't have an audience because you've got to drive the audience, right? Yeah, but learning don't forget what learning is like going on and spending three hours on whatnot and not selling much is learning Mm-hmm. So I'm a big believer in that like I love that you like I tell friends and people that have their social medias And they're like well, I don't want to post on there I don't want to you know, like what if I post and I'm like, what's the worst that's gonna happen? Nobody's gonna see you if you don't post but if you do post the chances of you getting discovered as a business or having organic growth The year you're shooting, you know, you get a hundred percent growth chance if you're posting versus not posting anything at all Trying to just grow my business and do that on other platforms tiktok shop has been my most profitable So what are you are you are you trying to figure it out because you're scared that tiktok will get banned in the next 90 days Is that foundational to the question already seeing like what had just happened previously? Yeah, that was super scary because I'm our family soul income now. So that's my big driving force So it's like, okay. What are the other options? I do how many followers do you have on tiktok right now? right now I have a hundred and 5,000 followers and on Instagram a Little over a thousand. All right. Listen to me two times a day I want you posting on Tiktok and I want you going live for an hour a day to just hang like I'm hanging now Until every one of those people to follow you on Instagram. Yeah, I feel like I have a hard time growing on Instagram like the same videos No, no, no, no, that's not work. That's not what I said Yep, because I'm not letting you make up some bullshit. Let me say it. I'm gonna be like a doctor here Dr. Gary is in the building two times a day I want you to post on tiktok and the entire tick make it creative, but the whole post is saying follow me on Instagram Okay, and I need you to go live for an hour a day not selling and Just shoot the shit with your community and tell them 18 times To follow you on Instagram. That's it. All right questions from Michelle If you inherited your parents company, but you weren't interested in the subject matter What would you do? Especially if you want to keep their memory alive and not just sell it very successful business But you don't have the capital or credit to run it literally listen to that question They're not passionate about it and they can't financially afford to run it because they have no idea what the fuck to do with it and literally You know one way to not honor your parents Is to try to honor them and have that business go out of business because then you both fucking lost you want to honor them Sell the fucking business take the money and build something that you're passionate about That would honor them more than that if I heard that right You don't like it and you can't afford to do it the fuck are we doing here? The number one issue in society is people holding up an ideology That has no practicality in it. You don't even know if that's what your parents want. They're dead deep down all the fucked up Shit that parents do it's all grounded in one thing. They just want their kid to be good They're just imposing their own fears under kids when they're fucking them up Get a good job Don't be an entrepreneur because they're scared to be an entrepreneur. But what if your kid's a fucking entrepreneur? Clearly this kid's not an entrepreneur This kid their parents were entrepreneurs. They're not an entrepreneur Which is hence the question. Michelle sell it sell the fucking company take the money and do something I'm an artist. I've been doing that for Since like 2012 11. I've always wanted to be a film director and screenwriter So I've been learning these things now like I have an event that's on march 2nd and I'm blending the storytelling to the show. It's pretty cool. But now I'm kind of like You know resources funding all this type of stuff. So I'm doing it myself. Yep. And I feel like I'm in a place of just Getting it's getting difficult to manage You know everything and what what what's difficult your remember difficult is how you see it Like, you know, so like to me Literally you were talking no bullshit ish. I think you're gonna like this could be interesting I'm about to say something very weird. I want everyone to hear it ish. You were just talking and I was getting jealous I'm not joking I am at a point in my career v friends t with gary v anything I do now Everyone's like, oh, that's gonna be successful. And if it's not it's gonna be like what the fuck Like being in that place where you're still in the beginning and you're building your thing I'm romantic as fuck to that You know when when you don't have the funds when you have to get scrappy Literally we were in the office yesterday only talking about How we got to get back to startup culture that when you when you don't have money You're doing it, right? And when you do have money, you're doing it wrong Let me give you an example if somebody came around and be like, I believe in you and here's 100k I promise you you would waste that 100k in a way that would surprise you. Okay So, you know how it is the grass is greener on the other side, right? Yeah I was with some uh single friends and some barry friends the other day at a party and Everybody started laughing because the married friends wanted to be single and the single friends want to be married It's like everyone just likes the grass on the other side. You need to enjoy this middle of the wall that you're in right now You need to enjoy you need to be excited and wake up and be like somebody might come to this show There might be nine people at this show But one of them might see this blend of fucking poet society storytelling improv slash Music like like you need to enjoy this part You ever see interviews of artists that have made it and like they've made it We're talking top 1% and you watch the interview and you listen carefully and they're like Man, I miss when it was just my homey and me in the van and we were fucking crying like Please fall in love with where you are right now. You're in the middle of the wall I have a feeling you might get to the other side of the wall and you're gonna remember this interaction Be like mother fucking gary was fucking right like I got I got the money I got certain things that I wanted but I fucking miss that creative process I miss a little bit of that unknown. I miss A little bit of that fucking dirt. I miss that go ahead. I don't mean to cut you. No, please I can I remember was it back in 2019 I did I'll started doing shows at house of blues And I had this feeling where it was like oh everyone was happy and then I was like wow This I feel empty like have you ever felt that? Oh, you know, I haven't felt empty and I think I'm gonna help you here I've had so many crazy things happen in my life And I don't my brother makes fun of me for not popping bottles or smelling the roses Right like I don't feel empty But I don't put accomplishments on a pedestal. I'm not trying to do it for the outcome Like I'm not trying to fucking it's not about the bank account. It's not about the grammy's. It's not about the certified Verified account. It's not about 10 million followers. It's not about being stopped every second that I walk It's not about being envied or or being put on a pedestal. I'm in my grind I'm doing it right now Right now as I'm with you I don't I don't need to be doing tea with Gary. There's 431 people. I'm wanting out right now Yeah, I'm in the dirt. I like the process I like the game I'm not here for all of y'all I'm not here for my dad like the last kid. I'm not here for the fans I'm not here for nobody but me I'm gonna do me I want to do me Okay, I appreciate that you understand everybody else was happy, but it didn't fulfill you Actually, I think that's why you can win But you took it as a negative Yeah, I take it when I'm like that as a positive Okay, I think it threw off my barometer of like, okay, then what is the goal? Correct because let me explain The goal is not having it like my I want to buy the jets that's on some in fourth grade I'd said something in school and it's funny. Let me promise you Nothing bad is gonna happen in my life if somebody else buys the jets one day I don't give a fuck. Let me tell you what my first post is gonna be when sally smith buys the jets Congrats to sally. Win me a fucking Super Bowl. I gave it a try. I didn't get there on to the next thing I'll go by the gritty nicks The goal in life is to not create a goal that fucks you up Got you, okay The goal in life is to like the fucking dirt every day Hmm Got okay. Yeah, I'm getting hype like I got some stuff. I got it like I'm I'm so ready to do stuff Like it was already before this but but when you think it needs to lead to something when it's in your soul And I can feel it in you. I look at this. I got goosebumps. I could feel it in you ish Yeah, you don't want to have a goal People like why am I not successful? I don't know maybe because you're such a dick face that you're not even Clinicking a button at the top corner to get 250 free dollars Ship to you in the mail because you don't want to spend three minutes to post it on e-bang and ship it out What about the gas fees dustin? What about the gas fees? I'm gonna do trash talk heavy this year. Fuck it. All right What's the question mckenzie? Okay Six million followers, but we haven't turned that into a real business. What's the best next move to monetize? By going on one of it's selling shit selling shit makes money I'm out of here I'm 24 I have two kids and I'm building a balancing a w2 Building an agency and running an east post business. I know my income building ventures will set me up for life But i'm putting less time into my creative passions like my personal brand and my fastened brand Do you think i'm approaching this the right way with my age having two kids and the responsibilities? By focusing on income now and letting my creative passion take a backseat. Okay, let me tell you what happened to my creative passion From 22 to 34 It was suppressed because I was building a business for my dad. You got responsibilities, bro You're 24 with two kids. I'm proud of you, bro. Like you're fucking doing the right thing It sucks sometimes because I know you want to get that creative nut off right But sometimes sometimes If you've got something really burning at you and you're excited work on it at midnight You know like on a friday night. Do you work on saturday and sunday or no? You got the weekend off? Yeah, the agency and the app is what I focus on on the weekends Beautiful. So you're getting a little bit of that, you know and so Nah, man, I gotta tell you your temperament is making me feel very kind and comfortable and really good and I just think it's a game of patience for you and what you're gonna be blown away by Is those kids are gonna be you know, they're gonna be 13 14 15 real quick And they're gonna want to hang out with their friends not their dad when that happens You'll have more time to work on it and you'll be 35 years old A baby for the fashion brand that i'm looking to build or i'm working on I have tech packs and things like that Um, do you think whatnot is a good place to do live shopping or a tick tock live with tick? I think I think both I think both tick tock shop is is in a lot of ways better because it allows you to get Audience yeah, so you need 5 000 followers on to get on tick tock shop live, right? So you I don't know if you're at 5 000 You know now they're not personal. Yeah, so you need to build that up Uh, and so while you're waiting Come here and start building and start pushing people from social to here. Look what i'm doing You know what's so funny? I always say mike watch what I do not what I say So I say tick tock shops better and everyone's like, ah, I don't have 5 000 followers. Meanwhile. I'm here today On whatnot pushing people from my social to whatnot you go live on instagram You type in your whatnot url and pin it then you go live on whatnot And you be on whatnot and you yell at everybody to come over and that's how you build slowly All right, who's next mckens we have melissa melissa 61 female wanting to totally recreate myself I have no products to sell I work a nine to five and my soul is slowly dying Tell me the number one thing you would recommend I learn right now to launch a new life and a new career Everyone on earth should try selling on tick tock shop and whatnot for a couple of hours just to see if they like it Like I think that a lot of us love something But we don't know it because we never tried it like in our little circle right here Somebody here loves skateboarding, but doesn't know it Somebody here loves cooking, but doesn't know it somebody here loves oysters sweetbreads Ooni and caviar, but you're all scared to try it I think people are scared to try shit. I don't know her like that, but I know she's 61 And you know, I'm the guy that's like, you know, everyone's ready for the joke of like you got 40 more years But I'm gonna say on the flip side. We're at 61 now That's different than 16 Like it's time for her to fucking fight And she's kept a conservative and I get it. She's a woman of that generation But the real anecdote the real potion The real fix is curiosity My friends the real fix for all of you that are stuck is curiosity. So many people here Are lacking a gene a trait called curiosity Some of them have curiosity, but because you know what beats curiosity, unfortunately in some people's body insecurity We need people trying more shit. What does she need to do? She needs to try more shit She she hates her nine to five. Maybe she should work a seven to nine bartending Maybe she likes bartending. She could become a famous social media bartender. I don't know Maybe she heard me right now and she's gonna set up a whatnot right now and sell some shit out of her house I believe garage sales my beloved garage sales Are moving to live social shopping. I predict in three years You will see thousands of people every saturday morning tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people Literally just running around their house and being like, all right, this pillow nine bucks nine bucks ten 11 I predict that and I think a lot of you should be doing that because all of you have a ton of shit in your house That you don't need when it comes, uh, you know to those challenges in life that you feel like burned out And uh, you're doing the same thing over and over and it's not working out. Um, what should I do? How should I get better break bro? I don't take breaks, but also I don't get burnt out because I am not looking for the result Yeah, yeah, I feel you. I really feel you. I want to stay in this Bro, I was working 18 hours a day For my dad's liquor store seven days a week through my entire 20s That man paid me nothing Because immigrant style I don't blame dad. He said one day when I die, you'll get the business That's why I don't pay you nothing. I go cool. You're gonna live to 90. I'm gonna be 70. I gotta go do my own thing But the reason I didn't burn out was I wasn't looking for the result Exactly. I knew what my mission was and at 22 to 34 I had one mission to fucking pay back my parents For all the things they did for me and then from 34 on I started building for myself Brother, there's a video that's going somewhat viral right now because cast and mike have a new book coming out called shoveling shit and they tell the story of me working starting VaynerMedia in their conference room and People seeing it from their eyes Where mike's like Gary didn't have fucking money It just hits different than me saying it And so why did I not burn out ever? Why have why will I never burn out? Because i'm not looking for a result Exactly the reason that people quit the gym Is they want their muscles to be a certain way their waist to be a certain way the scale to be a certain way And so they quit because they're impatient because to do it the right way it takes time 100 the reason people quit business Is because they want the fucking money They want the things that money brings them. They don't love the fucking business They love what the business gives to them. I don't like what the business gives me. I love my fucking businesses That's that's that's very hard very strong. I appreciate it. I love you bro. Good luck to you Fall in love with what you do for real everyone like if you love it It's a wrap Think about everybody close your eyes think of the person No bullshit that you love the most in the world Okay, open your eyes That person that you just thought of they may annoy you once in a while Disappoint you But you're never gonna be done with them. There's not a single day where I don't hate every one of my businesses I'm in the business of just eating shit 24 7 All that happens in my life is headache headache headache headache headache But I love it Think about the person you love the most you'll never quit them You guys don't love your businesses. You love what you think your business can do for you You
