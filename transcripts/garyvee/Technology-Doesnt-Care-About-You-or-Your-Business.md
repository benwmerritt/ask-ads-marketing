Totally, totally. Like technology didn't care that you or grandfather came from Europe, worked 80 hours a day for his whole life, built a small little bookstore, your dad came along, your mom came along, made it bigger, now it was your turn and it's a real great base and you're gonna take it and Amazon came along and put you out of business. Technology's just in here.
