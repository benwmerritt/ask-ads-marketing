## Transcript
Are you a videographer and want to travel the world? Like, I don't know, Mexico City? Obviously I love you, Dustin, but I need alternatives. We also have to keep him at home sometimes to do some shit. So, the D-Rocks, the Babins, the Caleb's, you've been seeing it through the years. We're adding a videographer to my team. I'm looking for applicants that really do this. We're not looking to train up anyone. When I did it with D-Rocks, we needed to train it. We don't need to train anymore. A lot of you do this for other people and you feel like you've got the skills. I want the recording ability and really know how to record me when I'm traveling 24-7 and be hidden in the background and capturing the moments and mentally making note of the moments that we need to chop up. But I also want somebody who's an incredible storyteller in the post-production, in video form, in long form YouTube. So, that's who we're looking for. Are you one of those people? Apply here in the copy here. I don't know how we're gonna post-produce this, but I'm looking forward to traveling the world with you. I'm just very excited about this trip for many different reasons, because I view it as the starting point of the next chapter. I've been having some meetings with several of you in the room. I believe that we have the right talent in place to be able to win the day tomorrow, but we have to really lean into bravery and humility, starting with our fear of the clients, and we have made substantial strides in that. But we have a lot of courage and humility to understand that we have a long way to go to be remarkable at consistently putting out social media ads that over-index in reach. This really just requires us to do the thing. If we do the thing, everything we want to happen will happen. And when I say the thing, what's the hook? What is required in the first place? What's the hook? What's the hook? What's the hook? What's the hook? What's the hook? What's the hook? What's the hook? What is required in the first second of the video? What's the thumbnail? What's the copy? Which platform? I didn't bring Peter Chun on this trip for his good looks. I brought him because I want everyone to see him and say to their mind, do I know how the platforms work? Do I know what's going on in pop culture? I wish this was 1965. I wish I could just come up with a tagline and say, put a bird in it, give me a million dollars. I would be the best in the world at it. It's just not that anymore. And it's my job at the top to protect us from where the world's going. Thank you. Gracias. You have a new book called, Dejur Unitations. Who should read the book and where they can buy it? They can buy anywhere, bookshops. So I'll let people figure it out. But I think the people that should read it are the ones that are trying to grow. Anyone that's looking to grow their business, their personal brand, their message, you can't make anything happen in the world without attention. Some people want to be the mayor of Mexico City. How can you be possibly the mayor without attention? My argument is attention now lives here. And whoever's best at this will win. And I tried to write the most contemporary textbook on showing people how to do it. How? Thank you so much. You're welcome. It is insane how creative AOR works in Fortune 500 land. You are paying millions of dollars to make decks. Creative AORs get paid millions of dollars to only sit in a room and come up with ideas with themselves and pitch you decks. They don't even make the commercial. They outsource it to production. You know what's even crazier is that those decks are three people's opinions and two or three people in a boardroom make a subjective opinion if they like the idea and then they spend all their money on it. You know why Avery? It's fucking crazy. And it's how the whole industry works. And it will fall for one reason. Five years ago people were not feeling the pain. And now the big brands are feeling it. Now they're taking it serious. Nothing changes until there's pain. I'm a content creator. And I wanted to ask you really quickly. It's that everyday struggle of staying relevant and that fear of not being relevant. The second you spend a minute on the fear of not being relevant is you're spending a second not being relevant. In my career Epson flows. Sometimes I'm hotter than others. It's just a process. Focus on the craft. Not on the anxiety of being relevant. Every minute you spend worrying about not being relevant is a bad minute. It's a minute away from you taking away from creating a new character. You have to create the right things. The algorithm is changing all the time. People get stuck. They get some success. And they get stuck. It starts to cripple them. Taylor Swift's career. There's been different levels of it being strong. It's normal. I would say I'm not at the height of mine. I'm okay with that. You know why? I have no choice. People really struggle with their first hit. And then when it's not hitting, they get anxious because they think they went away. But it didn't. If you had the ability to make it happen the first time, you have the ability again. And all your stress is killing your creativity. And then you're scared to try new shit because what if it doesn't do well? Everybody's on defense. Everyone's fear of not succeeding leads to them not succeeding. I have a very good idea. I really, I go with my intuition. Let's get on Zoom. Let's just talk. I'm less worried about us doing anything in the short term here together. I want to keep a little more momentum of seeing how much we align on vision. Because I always feel that if you leave karma and insight and value, it always works out in the end. Even if it doesn't. So let's get some time. Bye everyone. You're welcome. And I just say thank you. Love you too. Bye everyone. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. We gotta do this at the airport. We gotta do the airport. Pretty videographer? Yep. This is literally to tell people to join, right? Yeah. Got it. Are you a videographer and want to travel the world? Like I don't know, Mexico City. Obviously I love you, Dustin. But I need alternatives. We also have to keep him at home sometimes to do some shit. So it's right. The D-Rocks, the Babins, the Caleb's. You've been seeing it through the years. We're adding a videographer to my team. You get to travel with me. I'm looking for applicants that really do this. We're not looking to train up anyone. When I did it with D-Rock and created the genre or was one of the creators of the genre, we needed to train it. We don't need to train it anymore. A lot of you do this. A lot of you do this for other people. And you feel like you've got the skills. I want the recording ability and really know how to record me when I'm traveling 24-7 and be hidden in the background and capturing the moments and mentally making note of the moments that we need to chop up. But I also want somebody who's an incredible storyteller in the post production, in video form, in long form YouTube. So that's who we're looking for. Are you one of those people? Apply here in the copy here. I don't know how we're going to post-produce this, but I'm looking forward to traveling the world with you.
