Rough show, Jesus. Hello everybody and welcome to Wine Text TV. Wine Text TV brought to you by WineText.com, the number one way to buy wine on the internet and in America according to Tamara Vaynerchuk, my mom. Today's episode is popular, popular, popular wines. Four wines that I know all of you are going bananas for. I'm hyped, not only because I have two new books coming out. Links, please somewhere, do something. I know one is GaryVee.com slash DTA. But I'm pumped because I really, the last episode, so many of you can't find those wines. They're esoteric, they're small, they're rare. All four of these wines are obnoxiously available. Like I see them at the airport, in hotels, in every store in the country and that's good. And so that's why we're doing it. Let's get into it. Sonoma Catrera, Sonoma Coast 2022 Chardonnay, one of the most popular Chardonnays in the world, 92 points wine enthusiast. This is about a 20 to $25 wine depending on where you get it. Made in, Sonoma Catrera was a cult wine even when I was a kid. It was impossible to get, it was restaurant only, restaurant only for years. People would come in all the time. We'd get, then you could kind of get a little in the late 90s but this has been a very popular Chardonnay for a long time in the caliber of the Rombauer's, those very buttery, both of these are butter bombs. Potentially, let's see if they deliver on that. On the nose, a little bit of apple, little hint of pear, good little creme fraiche. Almost like. What's on a bagel? Cream cheese, thank you. Getting old out here, let's give it a whirl. Not as over buttered and over oak as Rombauer. A little bit more balanced, nice elegant smooth flavor. I see why so many people like this wine. It's pleasant, nice little hint of floral. But again, at 20 to 25 bucks, couple things on my mind. One, there's a lot of white burgundy, borgo and blanc, chablis even, Saint-Virong. That I think are more interesting Chardonnays to me when I taste this, very transparently. There's a lot of Australian Chardonnay that this tastes like that comes in at 15 bucks. I'm not overly blown away by this wine. It's nice, it's fine, it's pleasant. But pleasant to me is not 92 points. Pleasant to me isn't the hysteria that this wine currently has. Pleasant to me is 88 points and that's what I'm gonna say about it. So good wine's fine, like not gonna be upset about it but I think it's a little overpriced. I can buy a lot of $15 Australian Chardonnay that tastes like that pretty easily that I think is even potentially better. So yeah, it's fine. All right, bread and butter Chardonnay 2022, very hot wine, no rating. This is like a 10, 11 to $16 wine, 10 to 15 on WineSearcher.com, like the average is 15. So, you know, like, but some people are high and get it lower. This wine is ripping hot, Dustin. It's hot. Spicy. No, not spicy, hot, more like popular. Like, new guy or girl moves into the high school junior year and they're very attractive and like everyone's a buzzin. That's what bread and butter is right now. Let's give it a whirl. The nose is kind of extra, it almost smells like, ooh, I got a good one for this one. Do you remember now and later's? Do you remember the banana now and later's? Remember on the now and later's, sometimes you left a little piece of the paper on it and you like gave up it, you couldn't get it off, you just ate it anyway? That's what this smells like. Like a banana now and later with a little piece of the wax still on it. I smell like banana pudding. Like smell this, Carly. Let's see, let's see, Carly's snippy sniff on this. Smells like banana pudding, right? Do you smell that? It's like pretty distinct, right? Banana pudding, little banana now and later's. Let's give it a whirl. This is interesting. This is, wow, that's why this is so popular. What do you mean? I'm about to tell you what I mean. This wine is interesting. So this is basically Kendall Jackson Chardonnay all over again. This is very medium to light. It's light, it's like water with sugar in it. That's what this is. Honestly, I think that everyone should buy this wine. And then as a science project with your kids, get a pitcher of water, put a little butter in it, put two dabs of lemon and a cup of sugar and blend it and then taste these side by side. I think they're the same. Obviously this one has alcohol. Light, so the body's thin, which has turned off for me. And then just like sugar water with a little butter and two, just two, squeezes up, cut the lime in half. 85 points, not interesting. Let's move on. The whites didn't do it. Let's see if the reds can do it. But ironically, what I felt about both of those wines is like with big napa coles wines, they're over the top and there's a lot of sugar and fruit and it's not as interesting as a Bordeaux or a Barolo or a Burgundy for some people. But I like them for what they are. It's like, you own it. These got caught in the middle. They're not here, not there. Justin, 2020, Cabernet, 30 bucks at the winery, 20 to 30 bucks on this wine, depending on where you are in the country. This wine's gotten real popular. This is a winery I grew up loving. The Justin Isosceles of the late 90s was one of the best deals in wine. I sold the crap out of it to anyone who listened. They'd come in and be like, can I have Opus One? Can I have Insignia? I'm like, sure, but you need to get a bottle of Justin Isosceles. They would, it was like in the low 20s and it crushed. I thought it was better than most 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 dollar wines. A lot of red fruit here, cranberries, a little bit of plum. Smells a little bit like Mr. Bubble's Bubble Bath. Smell this. So like, I get a little bit of like that candy smell and like some of the scented, like, give it to Carly. Do you see what I'm saying? Like almost like potpourri, like, it smells like like a nice bathroom, like a happy bathroom. You smell it again. That smells like wine. Like when I think about wine. That's what that smells like. Yeah, it's very pungent. It's like very prominent, but it's very like floral. Like I get a lot of, it's very aromatic. I smell it as Mr. Bubble's Bubble Bath. I don't know what else to say. Like, let's give it a whirl. You know, America, you, America, you, boy, do you stay consistent. This is like a time machine for me. These were not the foremost popular or considering what Contreras was. None of these three wines were ripping popular when I was doing Wine Library TV. All of them are ripping popular now. And you, America, things change, but you sometimes stay the same. And this is one of these guys. This is sugar cavernade. Taste this. You're going to love it. You're going to love it. And there's nothing wrong with that. I'm not like, like, Carl. I do like it. Of course you do. Versus the other ones you've been tasting. Of course. And I'm not a wine person. Yep. Sid, get in here. It's a family affair. Carl, you like it? I do. Of course. I taste it. America, do I love, this is Twizzlers put in a blender. And they all just shook their head. Yeah, this is Twizzlers put in a blender and pour it out. It's the easiest way to get America to love a wine. It's called sugar. It's fruity. It's explosive. What it also is, is pretty hollow in the mid-palate. Not super interesting. It's fun. It's good. I'm about it. And I'll use a less human thing. Cupcakes are remarkable. It's just kind of hard to eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And that's why these wines win and then people get tired of them. And this is a very soft, this is well made but it's definitely not interesting. It's just tasty. And it depends on what you're into. And as an entry level wine to get into, I get it. And you know, to me it's an 87 point wine. Quilt, please save the show. Quilt, Napa Cab 2021. 91 points, wine enthusiast. 45 to 55 bucks a bottle. Very popular stuff. But I'll be honest with you, I'm a little... Last episode, four for four. I mean, Quilt, please save the show. Here we go. On the snippy snick. Less sugary on the note, like less bombastic and fake. Mr. Bubbles is chemicals. But also tight, which is interesting. I'm gonna rinse this for you last one. I want no residue from the Justin. Great color. I mean, purple. I love the color. The nose is a little tight. Screw top for a $50 plus wine that's super hot. Want to make that note. Screw top does not mean cheap or bad anymore. You know, let's get off that. Please kill that. That's a little fun fact for this show. Tight nose, not a very attractive, like just not a very exciting nose, tight. Which is okay, because it's an expensive wine that's young. What do you mean when you say tight? I'm not smelling much. Thank you for that question. Keep doing that. You know, not a lot of aromatics. I mean, you smell the last wine, right? Smell this. Do you see the difference? Do you remember the last one? You could like really smell a bunch of stuff. This is hard to smell. That's right. That's what I mean. So tight means like the tannins are holding in the fruit and you want the oxygen and age to open it up to get the flowers. Is that because it's screw top? Nope, it has nothing to do with screw top. It has to do with, because the more premium wine is and when it's younger, it tends to have much better tannin structure, which keeps the wine tight. So this is the one that you want to decant? This would be a wine that you want to decant and three hours will open up. It's gonna smell like that's what you need to do. That's a good indication, especially, some people have noses that don't pick up on stuff. Like it's very subtle. There's a lot of practice that goes into it. So if you buy a $15 wine, you don't smell it. Look, decanting is great. Oxygen is a friend, unless it's a weak wine. But you start getting the 50 for sure. No, really silky, great body, silky body, but sugar. Like a lot of... It just makes me laugh, because I'm enjoying this moment for myself. Like more of that changes, more of that stays the same. This is silver ol' Cabernet from the 90s. Like I'm just, I'm having some really fond, reminiscing feelings here. Look, this is a nice wine. To me, this is an 88 point wine, which is not bad, but it's just not 55 bucks worthy. Like I just think of all the things I could buy for 25 bucks that I would enjoy more. And so eight points, but rough show. Jesus. And you know what's funny? I kind of came in saying, okay, these are popular wines. Wonder where the American palette is. And the whites were a little less bombastic than where we were a decade ago. The reds are still right in pocket to what I would call overrated California caps. I would not recommend any of the four of these wines, personally. I just think if you want to go for this, there's alternatives around the world. Southern hemisphere wines can be over extracted fruit bombs for a lot less money. Questions? Do you taste these room temperature or chilled? Yes. I taste every wine room temperature, including the whites, because when wines are chilled, especially if they're over chilled, it's harder to actually taste the flavor of the wine. If you remember, Sid, I call this the high school beer rule. I don't know if you remember drinking really bad beer in high school or early college. You needed that stuff ice cold because beast was disgusting if it wasn't ice cold. Natty light is disgusting if it's not ice cold. And so I taste these at room temperature to get the essence of it, which does help the whites, at times even sometimes the reds, they're a better experience slightly chilled, but I've got to give you the essence of the flavors. But that's standard for everyone. Like everyone should like. It depends. Many, many, many tasters will go room temperature. Some will taste a little more chilled because that's the environment they're serving the glass at or things that they're sure. That's a preference, but I like to get the essence of the flavor. How does someone decide on a wine when they went for an Italian dinner, for example? How do I walk into a restaurant? How a wine list of 50 wines? I think you asked the sommelier if they have one for recommendation, ask them why they're recommending it. The other thing is my favorite thing to do is to order a wine that is at the high end of your price range. So push yourself to learn. And is something you've never had before. Number one thing about wine is exploring new stuff. Number one, number one. So what I would do is if I went to a restaurant is order something you've never had either in the grape or the producer. So if you like Pinot Noir and you know that you like Mio Mio Pinot Noir, don't order it again. Order a different Pinot Noir at the same price range on the list. Try new things. That's how you discover what you like. The reason I know what I like is because I've had context. The reason these wines are popular is some people have never had that many other wines. Or they've had another Chardonnay they didn't like as much but they've had like four Chardonnays, like two Pinot Grigios and like three Somnium Blancs and they're like, oh, I like this. Like that's seven wines out of seven billion. Try new things. Try new things. That is how we are ending episode seven of Wine Text TV. And as always, please sign up for Wine Text TV. Please leave heavy comments on YouTube, Instagram and everywhere you see this. And please pass this on to your wine friends. They need to get on the journey, especially your wine friends that are drinking these four wines. They may want the insight. ["Wine Text TV"]
