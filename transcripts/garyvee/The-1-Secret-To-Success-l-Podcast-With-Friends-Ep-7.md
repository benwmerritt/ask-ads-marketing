## Transcript
If you're authentic to yourself, not chasing every fucking thing, and you can fucking do this, then you can fucking win. Attention is the number one asset. VaynerNation, what is good? We are here for another episode of Podcasts with Friends. I'm gonna predict it now. This is gonna be one of the fucking cooler ones. We got some real fucking heat at this table. Some guys really moving in culture, making incredible sounds and fashion and trends and so, like we always do, we're gonna let people go around the room and say what's up, tell all of you out there who are listening live right now, but in the future on the podcast, a little bit about what they do, and then we'll chop it up a little bit, and with Twitch, we'll maybe take some questions from y'all out there and we'll go. So, we'll start with best looking. Let's go. What it do is drag a ice-web vessel, you know what I'm saying? I'm from Detroit, Michigan, Six Mile. You heard it? Yep, tell everybody a little bit more, so obviously where you're from and who you are, if somebody asked you what your sound is, what you do, why you believe things are moving for you, what stands out? Let's close that door. Dude, yeah. I'm from the, obviously I'm from Detroit, I'm from the east side, I'm from a hood called Six Mile, you know what I'm saying? My sound stand out because it's more so like, like the beat sound like, can we cut somewhere? Hell yeah. All right, cool. The beat sound like I made them motherfuckers in my grandma basement, you know what I'm saying? Just real gutter shit, like you know what I'm saying? Just real dark ass beats. We just popped that shit on there, you know? I feel like Detroit got a distinctive sound, and we've been pushing that sound for so many years, and the world's starting to like gravitate to it, you know what I mean? So I think by everybody else around the world and other bigger artists fucking with that sound, they like pushing it more for us, you know what I'm saying? So I just think our sound is distinctive and different, and I talk real street shit on there, authentic street music, you know what I'm saying? I don't sound like I'm lying. I get it, no problem. V, what up baby? Bro, we got so much love for you, it's so good to see you, you be good? You know that, yeah, I've been great, everything good. How was your new year? Regular, chillin' family, yeah, regular shit with the girls. Good, tell everybody who you are and what you do. Dave East, I'm from Harlem, New York City. I rap, act, I do a lot of shit. I feel like with me, my sound is more like, like he was saying, it's just authentic. You could believe it, it identified me where I'm from, my style, you could pop it in and tell where it's coming from type shit. So I think just the lyricism, the storytelling, all of that is something I really embody in my music. Dave, you, you know, before we get to the youngster here, pop it off, you really have longevity. And all three of you know this, everybody in the room knows this and everybody watching right now knows this. Like, it's really hard to do what you've pulled off. You've mattered for a real minute. For sure, dude. Like, why do you think that is? I ain't chasing no trends, I'm not trying to do what everybody else is doing, if it's hot, I don't try to just jump to the next hot thing. I stay grounded, I stay doing what I do, try to keep the same people around me. You know what I'm saying? So I feel like that keeps me in my own bubble, like my own world. Inner circle. Man, I don't really pay attention to what be going on outside of what I got going on, too much. I love it. I'm about to pop off a text to make sure people tune in. We're about to tell everybody. I'm 45 man. Now, before I even start myself, like it's good to be in this room with y'all. Like I appreciate it. That's a fact. Y'all too, because it's like I'm from New York. So seeing your shit way back to being in the same room is like, it's a full circle moment. And you too, I was telling them before I came here, or like before you came in here, that I used to watch the podcast. I remember you brought Booking into office and I'm looking like, damn, how the fuck I get in the office? Here you are, you know? You did it. And we made it here. So it's just like, I appreciate you for that. Happy doing it. I'm out 45, I'm from New York. But like, like y'all was saying, like y'all sound is like authentic to what you do. Like I'm not really from like the street life, but I'm from uptown, I'm from Washington Heights. So I grew up around it. But like my sound is more like, it's more vibes man. I'm here to like, I'm here to spread a vibe, you know? Absolutely, respect. Like we be doing mosh pits, you know? We in the mosh pits, but that's my vibe. So like, we in a different world, but it's the same world. It's authentic to you, bro. You in the same office. It's clearly the same world, but it's in a different world. So that's what I do. I run a clothing brand, like business type of thing. Like besides just music, it's clothes. People don't just know me for the music. But that's what being authentic is though. You know what I'm saying? Being true to yourself and true to what you got going on and sticking to, you know, your wave and your sound, whatever, just all around the board, you know what I'm saying? Nah, but you know, I appreciate all type of shit. So I'm over here. I'm definitely in there turnt up, you know? When I met, when I would like for a show like me, we was definitely listening to your shit back. And like I was saying, like, so I started making music when Chief Keefer was going crazy, like around that time. Like I wouldn't say making it, but like really into it. Cause I started listening to like Dug, Young Dug. That's my inspo. Free Jeff, my dog. Free Jeff for show. Free Jeff. Please, enough of this bullshit. Right, so go ahead. So that, we all know that era, okay. And then like, what sparked it? You were just like, I just feel like I can too. Now you know what it was. I was, so I'm born New York city, uptown Manhattan. And then my mom moved out to the suburbs. I remember when we were talking about it. Yeah, yeah, we were talking about it. So I moved out to the suburbs a little bit. So I got like the suburbs in my like world, but I wasn't really like matching up with it. You know, I wasn't like, I fuck with the business side of the suburbs, but I don't fuck with how people like acted out there. So I was like, you know what, I'm gonna take the risk, fuck living with my mom. I'm gonna move back to the city, live with my grandma back in Washington Heights. She passed away and then shit just started to work for me. You know, I just like, I took that risk. You know, that's really it. Good for you. Took the risk, man. You know, it's funny, guys. I think you're exactly right. And Dave, I actually saw a picture of you and I sitting courtside together at the garden. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We sat and saw it in social the other day. And I made me think of us that night. I was just like, recalling like, it's so funny. People throw around authenticity. Yeah. And we keep, you know, when I was growing up, keeping it real, it's all the same shit. And to your point, when Youngster was speaking about like, this is my vibe, the thing that I've always been most interested in, back to suburb shit, street kid, language, religion, income level, there's a reason that people that are very different can fuck with each other. Absolutely. And the only reason it exists is cause they're both being authentic and open. 100%. The only reason people that are totally different. Thanks. Like real shit. All of us know in the room, I see the head nods. I'm sure people are gonna say it in the chat right now. The reason you meet someone and you're like, oh, I fuck with this person. And on paper, 10 minutes before you started to chop with them and vibe with them, you're like, I'm not gonna like. Yeah. You know, think about every person that's ever walked into a room and you judged them real quick. And look, let's call it spade to spade. You guys are cool. Like, you know, and when you've got that as your currency, you always feel better than being hip to it, being fresh, having it. That's like money. It's a currency. And when people walk in, just like the country club with their third generation money, when someone from street walks in and they judge, someone that's got flavor, when someone that walks in that physically the way they're dressed, doesn't look like they have flavor. They judge them as I'm out with that person. But then they sit down on a plane. Think about the crazy people you chopped up with in the last three, four years on a plane. Not as a fact. And you're like, hang with like grandma. And the only reason it could ever happen is authenticity. You being you, they being them. Yeah. Thinking back to music and collaborations in different parts, I did, I actually did a TV show this morning where I talked about Adidas versus Nike in the 80s and I brought up Run DMC. Like, why did Adidas pop off? Like crazy in culture. And I was talking about Run DMC, right? And you know, just thinking about these things, like different worlds, when fucking Run DMC and Aerosmith made that music video and that song. She went crazy. You understand, I'm the old dog in here. Like, rock and roll was number one and it wasn't even close. Hip hop was a young baby coming up, starting to make some noise. That shit came out and it made such crazy noise. But the reason they fucked with each other was they were just being authentic and they liked each other. Yeah, truly is. And it changed everything. That is the watershed moment of momentum for hip hop that people don't understand. It quadrupled hip hop's interest amongst America. It took over MTV. That shit played on rotation. Kids, pre-Internet, when there was 36 channels on TV, that shit was on rotation 14 times a day and changed the world, but none of it happens without authenticity. And as a matter of fact, one of the things that I've loved the most having people come through this office through the years, whether they're businessmen who have no idea what the fuck is going on in culture or the culture people, trying to take it to the next step and build businesses is when people are open to shit. Yeah. Like, to me, the biggest reason people lose is they're closed. So for example, in settings like this, that's corny, that's selling out, fuck that. I ain't doing that shit. And meanwhile, the number one thing that artists should do is do a collab with a fucking K-pop band. But they're closed. Because they see it as corny. Right. For real. For real. That shit ain't, you know, one thing I know for sure is understanding is universal, bro. You know what I'm saying? You can, as long as you understand a person, as a person, we ain't talking about background, where my fuck are from, clothes, jewelry, who had it the hardest, they ain't about that shit. We can understand each other mentally. That's all I'm gonna fucking need, bro. I think everything about just building relationships and building bridges between, with one industry to another industry, that shit always work every time. It never fail. And that's why that Adidas shit, that's why that Rock and Roll hip hop, that's why I went that way. They closed the bridge that nobody thought would ever connect, you know what I'm saying? And they started something that message. Let me go around. Let's start with you. 2024, we're still in it. It's still Jane and Rick and ask these kind of questions. What's something you really, really want to accomplish? But let me give you the context that has historically been hard for you. Not a goal, not some shit that you wanna pop off, AKA something you actually wanna work on, based on your personality, based on the way you move, based on the things you've been scared about, based on the things you haven't historically done well. What's something you wanna accomplish in 2024 that if somebody that really knows you, knows you, like your mama, is like, damn, I can't believe he finally took that chance. I wanna get better with communicating with friends and stuff like that. Like that's a big one. Cause I got a lot of people around me. I'm the type of person that's like, yo, you doing me dirty? Like I'm just, I'm gonna just keep it. You cut people out. You know, not even really cut people out. Just like, I'm gonna let you like, deal with your shit over there. And I'm gonna do my thing. You're gonna have to deal with watching me do my thing. But my new thing I'm trying to work on is just communicating better with like, everybody, like family too. Cause like, when I'm in my own world, like I really get in my own world. Like, and that's like a problem sometimes. Cause then I'm like, I'm only communicating with the people I see. Like in front of me. You know, I'd be forgetting about the people that's really like background characters. And sometimes like, it's important to keep those relationships. I can't just like, throw it out the window. So communication is like a big thing. I'm trying to work on 2024. Like I'm going to communicate in like business for sure. We could talk business all day long. But real shit. But like to keep the problems. Like I want to get handle the problems a little more. Like a little like more hands on with that. My guy, that's a really wise thing to say for a young dude. That's what I'm trying to do 2024. Good for you. Dave. And you said history, but if I, if I, No, no, no, that's definitely, that's it. Okay, bet. With me this year, I opened a store last year in Harlem, called From the Deli. And I really want to see how far I could take that as far as the real estate game and Tell everybody who's watching and listening and will be listening. Open up with different cities. Tell them from the Deli, give them a little 411, what it is. From the Deli is basically one stop shop. You know what I'm saying? Everything you need is in there. I do a lot of events in there. It's just like a social space type of type of type of vibe. What's it at? 145th and saying that. Oh shit, okay. On the hill, yeah. How's being in retail been? You learned some lessons already? Yeah. Definitely. Cause I grew up in retail and everybody likes to get excited about retail. And then you start realizing like, the manager didn't show up in the fucking store and it opened. No, it's definitely worked. It's real work. Looking at it before I did it. And now I'm in it, it's definitely worked. But it's something that I feel like. What was most surprising to you? Most surprising. What caught you off guard? Like how hard it would be to sustain foot traffic? You know what? How managing people. Realizing who can really have working in there. That might be the hardest. You know what I mean? Because I'm not there running it. Let me tell you a real story that's gonna make you laugh on this. It's good for everybody to listen. So I was born in the Soviet Union, USSR, immigrated to US when I was three, lived in Queens studio apartment the size of this. Eight family members, poor, poor, poor. My dad worked every minute. American dream went from being a stock boy in a liquor store to eventually being the manager to eventually saving his money for seven years of buying his own shop. I'm 14, 11 years later, and I get dragged in, I gotta work at the, you know, some merchant shit. You know the corner store, Boday have family business shit. I'm working at 14. 45 minutes, my dad's store was from where we lived. I spent so little time with my dad at this point because he worked every minute. Even though my dad and I slept in the same house, my whole childhood, he would leave before I woke up and he came home after I went to bed. Some real shit. And I'm talking 360 days a year. Hey bro, that's crazy you said that shit bro, cause I be feeling, I wonder if my son feel that same way. About you. Yeah, and sometimes I be feeling guilty about that shit like, damn am I hurting my little man. Let me tell you something that you might, that might be, let me tell you something fellas, and for all the parents listening right now that are trying to figure out work life balance, let me give you an optimistic story. My dad did all that, I didn't see him all that much at all. He went to none of my games, knew nothing in my life until I started working at the store at 14 and I sit here today. My dad and I are tight as shit, I love them the most. We're super tight. Like sure, I'm a human. As I have an 11 year younger brother, and at that point, especially cause of what I did for his business, he was able to do more shit for my brother, do I feel some sort of way? Sometimes, but on some real, real, real shit, I have the best relationship with my pops. Now that doesn't work out for some people, some people's resented, there's things. And if you're feeling that way, I feel that way, I work like crazy, you gotta chop at it. You gotta, let me give you a good one then. If both of you feel that way, one time a month, when you normally, energetically, chemically, feel like no, I gotta do that show, I'm gonna take that business meeting, I'm gonna go to the Grammys, one time a month, choose the kid. Choose the kid. Get into the habit. Just like some real hot shit, like NBA All-Star. And Indiana, nah, this time I'm gonna take, got it? One time a month. Cause them events is gonna be there, them times with them kids, they getting old. I look back, just, was it two days ago, was the sixth year anniversary of my own Paranoia 2 album and my daughter's a baby on that cover. It's already six. She about to be eight. Yeah, it's crazy. Anyway, let me finish this story, cause you love this shit, Dave. You're gonna love this about retail. So now I don't even know my pops like that, plus my pops has these eyebrows that are naturally mean looking like this. And so, and he doesn't talk, so I'm just crazy scared of my dad. And we drive, and my dad is the reverse of me. I'm extroverted loud, he's quiet. So we drive 45 fucking minutes at seven in the morning, and he doesn't say a word. It's quiet right. And by the way, kids, pre-phone. I'm just sitting there listening to the radio. Word, don't fall. And this is my first day of work at the store too. And I'm like, and I was already slinging baseball cards, making money. And my dad, my mom told me the night before, he's gonna pay me two bucks an hour. And I'm like, this is some bullshit. Like I'm gonna work for 10 hours, make 20 bucks. I sold the Ken Griffey card for 80 last week. I was all mad. Anyway, we pull into the parking lot. My dad turns to me in a deep like Ivan Drago Russian accent. And he goes, keep an eye on the employees. They like to steal. That's what was always my... And that's what you're learning. There's certain people you can let in there. You know, it's just anything that you not looking at all the time. It's like your kids, someone they got a chance to sneak off. They gonna sneak off and do something. Like it's in human nature. You said something earlier, inner circle. Again, everybody in the chat, jump in on this. And all of you are like, you all know this. Like it's a very common thing that we talk about in street culture, in business, in everything, in the music business. That inner circles everything. All I do, by the way, my whole world, a lot of you got a little bit of sense. I'm trying to keep people forever so I can take them from strangers when they walk in day one to acquaintances when they start chopping me a little bit to friends when they chop more. And then fucking family. Absolutely. That's the whole fucking game. That's the process of it though. It can't just go straight from one to family. Of course it can't. Of course not. That's why I believe in working with family. Everyone says don't work with your family. Yeah, if you know yourself and you care about money over everything, don't work with family. Cause you're gonna lose your family cause you care about money too much. But if you're not just about paper, you should always work with family. Cause you've already gotten to the fucking main place. Been through it with them. Yeah, so that's your thing. Gotcha. My man, what do you got for us for 2024? My thing for 2024, right? Is to not be so shy about my entrepreneurship. You know what I'm saying? I make street music. I come from the streets. I'm a street guy. One thing I do, I have learned through experience. Like when you got so much other shit going on, it kinda take away from your music. And I love my music so much that I always end up putting the music over my other bits. You're scared to get distracted cause that's the core thing. And I'm scared for how people gonna look at it. Perception. Cause like I'm a business man, business man. Brother, like I had my first restaurant when I was 23 years old. My first car wash, the spenceries. Like I own a vape company. We got a chip company. I own a juice bar. I got a real estate. I own a movie distribution company and I own a movie film company. Overall, I got a lot of shit going on. And when I'm busy promoting all that shit and posting that shit and working for this and working towards that. Sometimes like with my fan base and Bro got the same type of fan. Like we got, we come from the street. So we got that fan base. They take, they try to, they try to dumb the music down and that shit take away from it. They feel like, damn bro, you ain't got nothing to talk about no more because you got all this shit going on. Or the shit you talking about it. The shit, it ain't real. It ain't real or I don't wanna hear it. So it kinda make me feel like, damn Bro got. Can I not be no business man? You know what I'm saying? Listen, come on fuckers. Take that shit the wrong way. Let's level up. Let's take this broad. Obviously for everybody who's listening that listens to hip hop and the culture and understands what we're talking about. We're talking about the streets fucking with you. Right? When the streets fuck with you. But the reality is this is a global issue. The number one issue in American pop culture is we are obsessed. Not just urban black hip hop culture. America, we build Brittany up. They tore it down. And we tear Brittany back. You know why? Cause we really love when Brittany's back bitch. We love the one, two, three. This country is obsessed with one, two, three. With that comeback story. We will pick you up. They love you. They tear your ass down. And then Rocky Balboas come back. They want it. That is what we are obsessed with. Build up, tear down, come back. They like when they count you out. And so to your point. And in sub communities, in sub communities, gender, race, religions, immigrants from different countries, they've got their own nuances. Yeah. Right? Whether Jewish or Muslim or black or white or India or from Pakistan, like they got their own little nuances. And then even within it, Detroit's different. Six wards different. South side Atlanta. There's nuance, nuance, nuance. Memphis, right? Harlem's different. Like it's all, like all these little nuances. This goes back to the number one thing I think about every day of my life. If you're authentic to yourself, not chasing every fucking thing. And you can fucking do this. Then you can fucking win. The problem is most people can't tune out the noise cause they fucking wanna hear the accolades. The reason people struggle with people's judgment on the negative is because they get high on the positive. Right. The reason my shit's- That's so real. You get a thousand love comments, the two haters you feel like they're like, I said something about you shit, they're like, me. That's real. You're right, you're right. Real shit, you guys know this. I post and I get a lot of love cause of the way I rolled. And when I tell you those 9,000 go-to emojis that come in comments, I can't hear them. I don't think I'm special. We'll talk. I'm aware I got stuff. We all got stuff. Right? But because I don't let them gas me, they can't tear me. Yeah. But like, so what I'm really saying right is, I don't care about how they feel about that shit. I look at like the whole dynamic of that shit like, damn this shit kinda throwing motherfuckers off from the music side. I get it. However, the part that I do gotta problem with, like with what you said, just resonated with me so much because of the sense I got. I can have a conversation about anything and I lightweight be kinda like, I do care what motherfuckers, how people feel about that part like that. Cause not with being a rapper, none day you can't have too much sense. And the shit just, it's just dumb. Shit just garbage shit. You know what I'm saying? Like I can't sit down and have a conversation about something that don't, none of my listeners or followers have absolutely no type of understanding of. And meanwhile, the number one way for you to enjoy the next 70 years of your life is having as many of those different conversations in real life as humanly possible. You know, back to, let's you know, just cause I thought about, I just thought about him today, maybe subconsciously cause Dave you're gonna be here. Nipsey? Yeah. Was Nipsey because of who he was having combos with. Right. That's every one of our challenges. Everybody who's in the stream right now, everyone who's gonna be listening over the next five years to his podcast, somebody's listening to his podcast right now in 2028. And I promise you, her number one challenge is not expanding her world enough. Worrying about the judgment of people when you walk into new environments. Like right, you know, street kid from Detroit, you should go to the fucking US Open Tennis tournament. Right. And get some different flake. Like it's it, it's the game. You deserve it. Because then the other thing is, and this is what I believe was foundational for a lot of us, when you grow up in adversity, it's the foundation of your success. You already know what losing tastes like, you're not scared of it. Yeah. And you're crafty. Yeah. Like that's just real talk. When you like, when you grow up in a jungle, you know there's animals around the corner. Absolutely. You grew up in a zoo. You don't. And so, you know, it's funny. I grew up in a way where I thought all those kids that had so much were so lucky. Now at 48 being grown, I feel bad for the kids that are grown up with too much. Right, absolutely. They're just not prepared. I got cousins like that. You see it, we all know it. And all, you know, we're all to different levels of our careers. All of us already at this point have been around very successful people. And you see it. And you know, honestly, no bullshit. I know, well, I say this a lot. And I know a lot of people don't fuck with it. They're like, fuck you, Gary, that's stupid. But I'm telling you, kids that have much, I feel worse for than kids that don't. Unreal shit. On some real, how do I feel their makeup is in their soul? I think for the parents that are watching right now, thank God that, but you got to watch it careful because you got to build them. I go through, yo, it's like my pops, he never just gave nothing. Like we always had to do something like, you know what I'm saying? Like, and I think about that with my own is like, damn, I give, give, give, cause I'm getting it. You know what I'm saying? But I don't know what I'm doing to them in the long run by just giving, giving, giving, giving, like, you know what I mean? But I got daughters, that shit is hard. They be got me wrapped around their finger. Oh yeah, there's that plus. I feel like if I had a boy, I might be like, nah. Like, you know what I'm saying? And the other thing that's great, you know what I'm saying? I'm playing that with my son, but I'm way tougher on my son. I ain't tough at all with my little girl. I do try not to spoil them though, like real shit. And they got everything they want, but it's a lot of shit that they don't got. And I do try to make them wait for that shit and I try to make them work for that shit. You know what I'm saying? My son, seven, my daughter, eight. Yeah, he gonna be like, you know who my dad is? And I don't let bro, it's a lot of shit that I don't allow them to see and look. And you know, there's a lot of shit they don't know. And you're lucky, eight, seven, you got another two, three, four years, then they're gonna know everything. Before they start Google searching. They're gonna know everything. I had to edit the YouTube. No, I didn't watch your videos. I wanna segue to something interesting. I wanna give some flowers. I wanna give some flowers. I'm gonna give you a few seconds. I'll set this up. And by the way, everybody in the chat, all 500 of you right now, leave some flowers for someone. Here's what I mean by that. On some real shit. I believe the world has gotten really good at spitting negativity. Real good. Negativity is loud as fuck. We're walking around 24 seven hearing something's fucked up. Everything. Super loud. I think- The algorithm hits. And the algorithm is a reflection of you. I'll show you my algorithm. It's Jets football. It's happy kittens on tree. Like I got positivity in my feed because I don't fuck with negativity like that. Everyone's like, the algorithms fucked me up. I'm like, you're the algorithm. That's your base then what you- You're the fucking algorithm. You're the algorithm. You're the algorithm. Damn. I know. I know. Honestly, there's very few things I know more than what I just said. I fuck with that though. That's great. You're the algorithm. Bro. Damn. If I had any musical rhythm, I'd be with you guys, bro. I got bars. I just don't know how to do the music. Anyway. I'm gonna give you a minute. Think this through. To that point. To the point of pick your kid one time when you normally would have went to work. There's some- I'm gonna do- We're gonna do it right now. I want you to think for a second. Someone that right now publicly forever minted in this recording. Give somebody love right now. Maybe even someone you never really get some random shit. Like a bust. Like something you've been in the back of your head. Or maybe something current. Somebody right now who's helping you in some way. Or somebody that put you on. Or somebody that really stopped you from getting caught on some shit. Somebody right now around the circle. I'll go first actually. I'm gonna give love to my best friend Brandon, Warnocky, who I met the first day of high school. First day. And I sold him some cards the next day. Because that's who I am. Yeah. But we became best friends forever. I do not believe that I would be able to have the career that I have. I've never said this public. Get ready Dustin. I do not believe that I have the career I have today. If it wasn't for Brandon Warnocky. Because I would have never left my dad's store. If it wasn't in his hands. That's real. Real talk. I could not be me. Because I would have never left my dad like that. Because I wouldn't have felt good. Back to family. I knew him from 14. We did baseball card shows. When we graduated college. He came in at 23. I worked with him every fucking day. Retail. 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 350 days a year. For a decade. He's family. As much as my brother and sister. I could have never made that leap to the next place. If I didn't know. I had somebody good good. Because my dad needed that partner. And I was that. And that was the closest thing. And so that's my love. Big shout out to Brandon Warnocky. I gotta do that for my big brother Rick. Okay go ahead. I don't show enough appreciation to him at all. You know what I'm saying. I grew up without a father. But my brother like he way older than me. And he was that father figure for me. You know what I'm saying. I grew up we had a like a love hate relationship. How much older is it Rick? Rick about 8 years older than me. I'm 11 years older than my brother AJ. Yeah. And that's why I jumped. AJ just graduated school and we started this company VaynerMedia together. So I know exactly what that relationship's like. And I don't appreciate. I don't show him no appreciation actually. You know what I'm saying. He did a lot of shit for me bro. Like if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be no rapper. You know what I mean. The first guy that made me sit down and just write a rap. You know because he knew out the way I appreciate it. Music and it's a situation I always think about this shit. I never spoke on it when I was in a knife gray right and this was the last. Look at read the chat. Look what they're saying. What they say. What they say you give him your flowers to Rick Owens. Ricky Smith. Yeah. My brother. You got to clear up chat. Don't fuck it up. I got a crazy story though. Right. I was a ninth grade. Boom. That's the last. This is the last. This one I dropped out of right before I dropped out completely. So I was a popular kid. You know I was I was the ninth grade. I was a ninth grader with a 12th grade girlfriend. You know what I'm saying. I failed all my class usually is the reverse. So that's some good shit. I failed all my classes and now I knew I was going to be embarrassed to go to the 10th grade and still be an all ninth grade class. And my big brother sold the rims off his car and paid for my summer school and I dropped out that shit. I didn't go to summer school. Sold the rims off his car. The rims that he say he worked hard for and saved up for for months. Sold them bitches so I can go to summer school just so I wouldn't feel embarrassed and look crazy. You know what I'm saying. So I didn't show no appreciation in and I feel like I don't show enough. Now I do the whole here you go type shit. You know what I'm saying. He is on many his own boss. He got his own money. You know it ain't much I could do for him but I do do the financial. He's about to listen to this shit. Yeah. This is why we're having this shit. Yeah. You just did. That's it. Yeah. To your point. So if if you can't give paper because they got it like that one can't give it. The only other thing that really really really changes it is words. By the way on the record because we're some grown people in here. Words over paper every day. Yeah. People want to hear it. Yeah. People want to fucking hear it. But I'm proud of you. That was some deep shit. Yeah. Love appreciate that brother who's got something who's going with flowers. Go ahead. Now my mind is like mine. It isn't too like crazy. Good. Indeed. Like that. But like I got to give appreciating to my boy Sham right here. Let's go. Because when I when I met him like I was in a really dark spot like mentally like he's my producer my engineer. And when I had met him I was just in like a like kind of just figuring my life out like I just moved back from Baltimore and like I was kind of just like not sure if I wanted to spend time in Baltimore. I'll always get you in place. It was dark over there. Yeah. But I kind of. Baltimore ain't no fucking joke. It was done. Big shout out to Baltimore like you want to talk up your kid send them to Baltimore for a year. That's a real fucking Baltimore is a real fucking place now you want to know is New York is he New York's gotten a lot softer than the last 30 years. Baltimore ain't fucking around. No it's just crazy. I went out there like with a girl at the time that I was with. Oh now I know where you were fucked up. Yeah we went out there. You know I crashed out in Baltimore a little bit. I made it back though. And then I met Sham. And then he kind of just woke me up like on some like like Brody this is the first person I ever had in my life that was like hungry for this shit like me. So like when I when I met him I didn't realize how hungry I even was. We were just cooking having fun in his crib like he picked me up from work because I was working at UPS. Yeah. The first time I met him he picked me up from UPS and I was like who is this dude like he just picked me up. We drove to the city. We cooked. We went to the studio. We cook some music and like we just had a connection and like since that day. Bro like me and him have not ever like switched up on each other. There's been a time where like he actually was like like we shot a music video in Miami. He paid for everything like took me to Miami like yo I believe in you so much that like I'll invest my own money time everything. And then so that's why we you know Sham with me to the to the end of this shit. That's real. To the end of this shit. Beautiful shit bro. You know and he a big part of my like everything music like my whole music career for wasn't for Sham. I probably wouldn't be where I'm at. That's beautiful shit. That shit. I didn't see it. Now yeah for sure. And he definitely here to see it like that's why I make sure he comes. Yeah man flowers. You know Dave what you got bro. Mine's I got to give it to my brother big bully. Speaking about B. Moore. I did. I was locked up and B. Moore and he was the person that was right there to pick me up when I got out. You know I'm saying and from that from then on from before then but I feel like I wouldn't have the drive or the the the the love I got for me. Love music. If he didn't step in my life when he did because he was the first person to bring me around. All of it the studios the rappers that was already on I got a chance to see all that before I like 10 years damn near before I even got on. So I would have to give it the bully and I'm saying just over the years even to this day. Been nothing but supportive. He was the first person to drive me on what we went North Carolina. My first book and it was for like $500. He drove all the way to NC drove back. So he always been from negative ROI event crazy. We lost money. Exactly. But there was the excitement. But kids listen I jumped in for a reason there. Think about what Dave did. He drove from fucking New York to North Carolina for $500. I was so excited. I'm listening to kids in my DM. That's right. People don't know people get confused when you get paid to do something that it could be an investment. Right. I just why jumped in. I want to give something first. I know one person's going to hear one about the say and change the way they move and it's going to change their life. People understand doing shit for free is an investment. You tell somebody like go do this. It'll be good for you. Okay. But when they get paid a thousand if it costs them 1300 to do it. They're like nah. I'm lit. And I'm like no no you don't get it. It's something about getting paid for some shit even though and you lose money that confuses them that that's an investment. And they say no to shit that would have been the shit that changed their life. Every one of us as we sit here right now said no to some shit that would have changed our life for the better. I think about all the people ask me all the time with the way I roll. What's the biggest mistake you've made. I'm like the ones I didn't know I made the meeting I didn't take that would have met to the intro that would have led me to being the first. You don't know. Yeah. 100% I could talk about passing on Uber. I fucked that up. I lost 500 million. I could talk about like all the dumb business mistakes the way I don't like that I managed for a long time because I wasn't real with people. I try to fix them without telling them they were fucking up and then I got dirty. I could talk about all that. I know as I sit here today especially the way my life played out. I didn't take some random meeting. That would have been the meeting that set up because I take the meetings when they're fucking CEO of Disney. I'm talking about the meeting and I say yes to a ton of shit. That's why I win. Yeah. But you can't especially the last 10 years I can't say yes to everything. Right. Or the or the back to like picking the kid over thing or Dave sends like yo I got a release party. I'm like fuck him in Indiana like yo I hope it's amazing like maybe I would have should have said yes to that not done that business meeting. And in that meeting in that launch party I might have met dude and dude this dude would have like it's the connections. The biggest mistake I've ever made is the meeting I didn't take. I like that. That's hard. And so I think about that a lot. I want to go back to bully for a second just the way you told the story. Obviously the dude that picks you up when you come out the fucking lock cell that person's always gonna face. First face I've seen. But the way you said it you guys were just friends like it sounds like that took the relationship to a whole nother level. Now we was locked in already like on some street shit though. Like it wasn't. Yeah. No music or nothing like that going on at that time. Back to when he brought you around. I like you said something I want to I want people to hear this. This is what I want. By the way this is why I'm doing this show. I know that I have such a crazy wild audience. They're all over the place. Yeah. Because I'm all over the place. So I know that a ton of people like I was reading when you guys first sat down. Some people losing their minds that y'all are in here. And tons of people being who the fuck are these people. And that's why I do this podcast with friends because I'm trying to the reason I'm doing this show is I'm trying to put y'all on to new people. First I think all of you have something to say to people in my world that you're going to help them. Second there's a lot of business people in here and it's going to lead to shit for y'all. So I love doing this shit. Absolutely. But I want them to be exposed to new shit. Right. You said something that I want to click on. He brought you around. You got to see people that were winning. Back to flowers. When you were making that transition. Which person do you remember vividly out one night whether in studio in the club on the stoop whatever the setting was in the board room. Who caught your attention that was an artist that was winning. What did he or she say. What did they do. Do you remember an early story when bully was bringing you around when you got to see like big pun move like this or like a four instance. Anything stand out. I know it's like there's sometimes that really like it's hard to recall but I'm just curious if anything popped off on some artist that you know. Early on with him. I would have to say dipsut when they was like innate in that glory. I mean because I was I would see them in Harlem one would like not knowing them. Of course. Then I'm with bully and I'm seeing them in a whole never like you know what I mean. So it was like and what they really rock stars like I said just they hold demeanor to close the the whole get up. You realize. Oh this is how they are behind the scenes. Right. 100%. And I had I had up my big bro was right there. I'm just in the back observing just like a sponge just soaking up game from all of them like you know I'm saying but seeing that that early was like damn this shit might be possible. Let's talk about social media. Just because it's such a big currency in the world. Yeah. But where we're at. A lot of people were where we're at. Everyone's got different relationships. Somebody at this table is about to tell me they don't have any app on their phone. Makes sense to me in 2024. Somebody else is going to say this that as a human and as a professional talk breakdown social media for you right now. How are you using it? What do you like as a dude? What do you like to use from a promotional standpoint? What do you wish you've been using but you're like scared to get in there? What's stopping you? Breakdown social media for you right now. The one I ain't used yet that I kind of you know be reluctant to fuck with is the TikTok shit. You know what I'm saying? Just because the image TikTok got just like ain't nothing but a bunch of dancing like just all that shit. I ain't really interested in not that that shit is a bad thing or whatever. That's just one of the ones. I'm sorry I apologize. I was distracted. I want to hear it one more time real quick. TikTok is the one I ain't like really fucked with yet. Did you think it was corny and little girls dancing or the thing that I'm seeing from real winners like you? They're worried about going on there with no followers and they're worried to set up an account and they only got 500 or 1000 or 2000 followers and they think it looks bad. Or is it a third thing that I didn't bring up? I just feel like I didn't have much to add to the app. You know what I'm saying? Is it because you thought you had to be silly or do skits? That's exactly what it is. I felt like if you're not dancing or you're not making music. No, I'm not. There was some mix up. Sorry about that dude. I felt like if you ain't making music that motherfuckers can dance to and shit like that or there ain't no jokie, joke shit or just whatever the fuck it is. Got you. You know what I'm saying? Just one of them. You're making a big mistake my man. Yeah. The only currency for all those businesses and your music is attention. Before you can sell or get somebody on, they got to be listening. Yeah. Attention is the only currency in the world. And the enormity of attention on TikTok and back to how what you do remarkable. Bro, I went on TikTok when it was called Musically. It was only 14 year old girls. I was scared to go on on some people are going to be like, you got to go to jail shit. It was that early. And you know what the first content was? Business talk. I went on Instagram and did this. Yeah. When nobody was doing this. Right. People were taking nice photos of the skyline. Yeah, so fuck. I went in and did my thing in the room. I didn't give a fuck what the room was doing. You're giving a fuck what the room is doing. Yeah, I am. Go on TikTok and make Instagram videos and let it work out. Right. Got me? Yeah. You are too ascending to be silent on the MTV of this generation. Yeah. That motherfucker is MTV. Right now, like social media is like a short form content thing right now. Yeah. People don't even care about music videos. Like unless like obviously like it's fire, but like. Attention span. You go viral off a five second clip. You shot with your men's at your crib before you go viral for the $20,000 budget video. It's called the gate. It's the gateway drug. Yeah, like it's the gateway drug. It's like a gift and a curse to social media. By the way, back to if it's, but if Cole Bennett makes a fucking video, I'm telling you right now people are going to watch that shit. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like quality matters. Yeah. But to your point, it's the fucking it's the Nick bag. Yeah. TikTok's the Nick bag. Yeah. That's like. It's like. It's definitely punching. You feel like social media is like a gift and a curse though. Of course. It's like both. Money and fame exposes you. It doesn't change you. Yeah. It's a gift and a curse. Yeah. The reason you all know this because a lot of you have this aspiration. Money and fame exposes you. Now social media is doing that to everyone. No, I ain't saying more so like a gift and a curse like with yourself, like with our self just more so like the energy with social media media just period. You know what I'm saying? Just just watching everybody. I think we're saying the same thing. A lot of people care about shit that just it matter that don't matter. As the old dog hitting here pre internet, the number one show on TV was lifestyles of the richest famous and people gave a fuck. Yeah. MTV Cribs happened before the social media. People have been caring about dumb shit forever. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. It's true. Because bro real like this shit like this shit shouldn't matter bro. Like just being an artist like this shit shouldn't matter. I got it because I like it. Yeah. But in reality bro, I know I don't value this shit. This shit don't mean nothing to me because it don't make me who I am. I'm a man. I'm a real nigga regardless. Bro, you're lucky. You're lucky between between your older brother and the circumstances even watching you from afar and now chopping up. Like you said in here, you got a good foundation. You're called secure. You got self esteem. Your balance of self esteem and insecurity isn't a good spot. Yeah. 90% of people on earth's insecurity eats them alive. And whether it's on Instagram. Life has always been this. It's just heightened. You know. It's just in your face. Now before you had to watch it on TV. Yeah. But now you're at the toilet. Yeah. But honestly, wherever you had to watch it. People rewriting history. People were either reading a magazine or newspaper watching TV like or talking about it in the fucking street. Right. Or a barbershop. Some shit. Yeah bro. Like you couldn't be in New York and see a footage of somebody getting blown up or killed. Sit like that. That's it. Yeah. Like you couldn't see it. It wasn't as graphic. And the question becomes but let's but guess what? Let's not act like the last 200 years we were so great. Oh yeah. So when I hear that. All that shit was happening. I just couldn't see it. Right. Guess what I'm saying. Maybe this is the one step backwards for eight steps forward. Maybe we need to see this shit. See this shit. What's going on everywhere right here. Because if we ain't seeing this shit then we wouldn't be aware of it. That's real. That's so real. That's so real. You got a lot of knowledge over here. Bro, I got some wisdom in this fucking body. That's so real. Bro, I thought that you were ready for it. For me it's all people. It's always been people and I got lucky. If you looked at my second grade photo I went to Martin Luther King Elementary School. I got real lucky back to where we all grew up because environment makes us. Listen to how we all talked. If you look at my second grade photo. Actually team you want to dig it up. I want to post it again soon. It's crazy. There's 20 kids in it. Five kids are black. Five kids are white. Five kids are Asian. Five kids are Indian. On real shit. I wonder if the team could pull it up before you leave. I never seen a class picture with better diversity. I got lucky. My mom taught me to love. And then I was just around all kinds of different people. And then I got that's it. That's all you need. And that's what we need to be teaching. Right now we're telling everyone to hate each other if we look different. Religion, race, gender, income level, what we wear. And we need to do the look at this picture. This shit is crazy diverse. This is fire, bro. It's fire. Right? You see my little swing? This is crazy. That's fire, bro. And that's why I love the internet. Because the internet right now we're focusing on what's bad. On the flip side we're getting cultured. You're choosing to only pay attention to something. If you're just looking at hot bitches all the time that's your world. Yeah. No. That's all that's going to pop up. But if you try to widen it you can get to everything. You want to learn how to cook? How are you going to learn how to cook pre-internet? If nobody around you could teach you how to cook. Explain. If you want to learn how to surf. You know what I mean? If you want to work on your men. People talk about all the mental shit that's out. For grown men into the shit that we're into with our backgrounds. We're exact people. 25 years ago is not talking about the shit we just talked about. We talked about feelings up in this bitch. Real life. 25 years ago we ain't talking real shit. We got fucking cool rap. What I grew up with cool rappers talking they want to be better dads. That's legendary. That's legendary. That's fucking good to hear. Being enough of a man and vulnerable enough to say on God right here in this room I haven't been good enough to my brother. Get the fuck out of here. So I think shit's heading in the right direction. We're choosing to look at what's not going well. But a lot's going right. It's just unfortunately there's not enough messengers of that. That's why I do this. I want to be loud about positivity. Here's what it is. Negativity is loud because misery loves company. Positivity keeps it in their circle. You know this? The most positive people are like cool we'll just chill over here. We're good. Because when you do what I do which is you go out there and make positivity loud and you put yourself out there you get fucking lots of fucking heat. People want to point fingers. They don't want to point thumbs. When I'm like it's good out here that means the next thing coming out of my mouth is and you're in charge. If it sucks it's because you were sucking. Not because the president. I'm so excited for this presidential election. I love when the president switch. You know why? Not on any other reason than everybody right now who's blaming their life on Joe Biden in a year when they still suck. They don't matter who in this president is for sure. They voted Trump then they voted for Biden and Trump again. Then they're going to vote for something like. It's up to you man. It's up to you. What you do is up to you. We need to not take. It's up to you. We got to be on top. Accountability. Accountability. Yes, they're systematic shit. There's racism and sexism and everything. It's always been though. But that's always been changed if everybody individually decided to pay more attention to themselves. And not the next man. They don't like to vote themselves accountable though. They don't want to be. I think the world one thing that I pray get way better right now is for everybody to be able to accept that we all may have different opinions and outlooks on certain shit. But that don't mean it's a problem. That don't mean I don't I hate you. That don't mean I dislike you. That don't mean it's something that we can't agree on. I should be able to say A bro you like green but I think I think I think the orange is better. The problem is first of all I love you with all my heart. Comma. Comma. Comma on some real shit. Green and blue is easy. It's when someone's saying some shit about your people. Where we got to get the ultimate strength is when someone shits on your people your gender your race your religion your town when someone shits on your people do you have the strength to react with trying to understand why versus hating back and right now it's hate back. And we got to identify that because some some things don't be a person shitting on your people your culture your religion. Some some shit be true. You know somebody say hey that's like it's like let's be like let's be real right. That's like if someone wants to be like yeah black on black crime is at a high rate. That shit is true. It ain't funny to be like man why you always got to bring that up. You know what I'm saying. What about this. Bro it's it's it's it's it's fucked up black on black crime is hot. That's not an insult. That's a true statement. Let's figure out how that person is basically saying hey brother with all due respect your community should maybe you know trying to figure out some type of peace amongst each other and maybe you can start that conversation. If you if you got a positive mentality that's what you really hear. But if you got a fucked up mentality you really hear it. You really hear it. Black people hate each other. They kill each other. But that's not what that person is saying. Because I gotta run to my next shit. I'm going to leave it with what you just said my dude. Life is how you see it. If you wake up tomorrow and say everything's fucked up I got news for you that whole day you were going to find shit that is fucked up. But if you wake up and be like yo life is good like I'm lucky I'm even a person. I could have been a fucking rhino. Goldfish like let me try to find some positivity. You will find it every this has been an hour of positivity. You should see the chat. This has been a full hour. You can find it. You just got to follow the right fucking people. Anyway thank you fellas. Love you. Thank you. Love you too brother.
