## Transcript
Every local business that's watching right now must run $100 a week in ads, amplifying a piece of content that is either done well organically or is made on a 10 mile radius of their location. And then if you really know your demo, then you do $100 10 mile radius 40 to 60 year old female. But you need to post organically a lot more just post. I think I get it. I think it's just do do do. And if you don't have an opportunity to fail, then you're not going to see where you need to tweak it and make it better. Correct. If you don't post, nothing will happen. You'll just sit around and think the fuck's a matter of people. I'm dead right now. Ask it again. I want to just I just want to feel what I felt. Michelle asks, I've been with my company for seven years. They recently announced their closing our office in three years and relocating to another headquarter in Florida. People who don't relocate will be grandfathered into remote work but are no longer eligible for promotions or lateral moves. I love my job and the people I work with but feel executive leadership is ruining it. Should I stay and not ever make more money or leave what I've built up over the last seven years to restart somewhere new? I actually think this what's her name? Michelle Michelle. I actually think you're being incredibly entitled. Michelle, you're being obnoxious. This company is relocating to stay alive. People don't realize companies die if they create coddling. This isn't parenting. When your parents over coddle you, you just become a loser. When a company over coddles, it goes out of business and everyone gets fired. Did I hear that right? The company gave people a three-year notice. I thought you, when you said three, I swear on my kids, I thought you were going to say months. The company gave everybody a three-year notice and then on top of that, the company says you get to keep your job and work remote. Are you fucking kidding me, Michelle? I hope they fire you right now. Upper management is ruining it. No, no, you not realizing that shit changes and your lack of adaptability and your entitlement. The world is, life is not fucking fair. You can go get another job. I'm dying here on this one, Michelle. Michelle, I love you and of course, I don't really mean like I hope they fire you, but fuck, Michelle. The fuck's the matter with you? Three years, three years notice and not even getting fired. You get to keep your job remote, but you just can't get promoted. Are you fucking crazy? The entitlement is off the charts. I think that company is remarkable. Please tell us the company so I can send them a fucking gift basket and a note to say that they're remarkable people and I might just shut down my companies and go apply for a job at this company because this fucking company is the three years notice and then you don't even lose your job. You get to keep it and work remote. We've lost our way. China's going to win. That's it. China won. No, no, China won. That's fuck Europe could beat us at this point. What the fuck was that? This fucking question really put me on tilt. Corso, this fucking lady asked me, you heard it? You're watching? Three years notice to not even lose your job. This poor company is just trying to move to Florida to have better tax structure so that they can keep the company alive. It's competitive out there. AI is coming. Do you understand how hard it is to run a fucking company? Everybody's got, you know what happened? All this propaganda got people thinking corporations and CEOs. It's so easy and they're so bad. Everybody got you twisted, kids. You go do it if it's so easy. Why don't you start your own company, Michelle? Why don't you start a company? The fuck's a matter of people? I'm dead right now. I just want to congratulate the communist regime in China. It's very clear to me that us Americans are fucking lost and outer space. Vanessa Brito on YouTube says, Gary, chill. Vanessa, I will not chill. I love us too much. I love everybody who's watching this, my community too much. Faith, I am irritated. Fuck me. What's your question? Yeah, my question is, so I built a pet care business. The first year we did about $30,000 and then the third year we did $250,000. Good for you. Thank you. So I'm trying to figure out a way to scale and make it bigger. My business is called Wiggle Your Tail Pet Care. Wiggle Your Tail. I like that. Yeah, Wiggle Your Tail Pet Care. We also do dog training, pet taxi, dog walking overnight. We pretty much do everything. I'm just trying to figure out a way to make pet care a need because I feel like so many pets go into the shelters, into the rescues because people don't have the time to care for them, even though they have all the luck. How much social media content are you putting out daily? In the last month, I would say probably about 15 posts. Not horrible. So once every two days. Pretty much. Okay, not the worst. I thought it was way worse. Okay, what do you normally get in views on a TikTok? 50 views? 100 views? A thousand? On TikTok? Not much at all. It's been really hard. I do, hold on. I do have a question though, because I feel like I have 11,000 followers on my personal TikTok account. Is that something that I should integrate? Should I integrate my personal life, my business? Yes. Okay. The other thing that you need to do is you need to run ads on Facebook and you need to spend $100 a week on a 10-mile radius of your location. Okay. And if you don't know what I, like if you don't know the details, you go to Google. Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, you have to run every local business that's watching right now, must run $100 a week in ads, amplifying a piece of content that is either done well organically or is made that's a very hard sell on a 10-mile radius of their location. Okay. I feel like I did that recently and I did see a lot of engagement. I just never know how much to spend. I never know how much to spend. $100 a week, 10-mile radius. And then if you really know your demo, if you're like, well, I really crush, if I noticed, most of my customers are 40 to 60-year-old women, then you do $100, 10-mile radius, 40 to 60-year-old female. Interesting. I like that. That's more specific and because it's already like narrowing it down. Because if you did 10-mile radius on Facebook and I hit 27-year-old dudes, who you know are not going to really hit you, so you want to look for your demo, understood? Yeah. $100 a week, but you need to post organically a lot more. Stop worrying about anything other than you need to post multiple times a day on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, all of it. Okay. Just post. Don't worry about anything else. Just fucking post. I like to be very private with the content that I post. I don't like to post a lot of my clients' homes and things like that. Don't. I don't. I don't. I've posted more than any human on earth for the last 15 years. I've posted nothing private. You don't know shit about my kids. You don't know about my kids. People want to see the dogs. You know? Yeah, but you've got to figure out how to do that. Maybe you go to a dog park and you interview people. Okay. Okay. You see where I'm going? What would I ask? I mean, we do do dog training. What the fuck you ask? You're in this fucking business. You ask them shit you fucking know. But random people are going to be like, why are you coming up to me talking to me? You know what I mean? Do you know what year we live in? We live in 2025. You're coming up with a fucking phone and you're coming up to someone. They know what the fuck is happening. Okay. And the ones that don't want you to interview them will shy away and look at you weird. And the other half will fucking like put on some lipstick and ready to fucking make some fucking social media content. So I do have an idea and I was thinking about this. It's I bought this like costume dog costume and I wanted to put our T-shirt on it and I wanted to go around and just have it like wiggling its tail, like just randomly wiggling its tail around the city and it was going to post on TikTok and be like, have you seen wiggle? Yes. You know? I thought that would be really cute. I think it's cute. It likely won't work, but I need you to do it. Okay. You see where I'm going? Yeah. Yeah. Just do. 90% of the things that I think don't work. Yeah. Just do it. Let me say it nice and slow. 90% of the things I think will work don't work. That makes me happy. Not sad. You motherfucker. You're all insecure and scared and you're the reverse. Yeah. I think I get it. I think it's just do, do, do. And if you don't have an opportunity to fail, then you're not going to see where you need to tweak it and make it better. Correct. Yeah. And if you don't post, nothing will happen. You'll just sit around and think. Yeah. I'll have to do that. Good. Love you. Thank you. You're welcome. I want to say this nice and slow for everybody. I believe that if you are a human that is building a personal brand, you're a creator, you're an influencer, wannabe, that if you have between 10 and 50,000 followers, maybe even 10 to 100,000, maybe even a thousand to 100,000. Yes. If you have a thousand to 100,000 followers and you are, you have any level of salesmanship, like you like doing a garage sale, you've been a salesman, you're not scared to sell, that I believe you should be joining whatnot and selling something, even random stuff in your house and starting to practice. I believe the rise of the creator and influencer economy is that there are tons of people that have 5,000 followers on social media right now that are never destined to be Mr. Beast or Logan Paul or Charlie D'Amelio destined to never be me, but are actually destined to make 100,000 a year being someone who sells on social live commerce. There's a lot of you that are trying to get to a million followers that have no chance to make 100,000 a year and do plus and do what you want. Half of those people actually will crush on live shopping and will get to where they want to be, but they need to be a commerce tainment, a content creator that sells things on whatnot and TikTok shop and all the future live shopping platforms. Amazon's got one coming, Walmart's got one coming, eBay's got one coming, meaning they all have one right now, but they're going to get better. I don't know what Facebook and Instagram's waiting for. I don't know what YouTube's waiting for. I don't know what Twitter X is waiting for, but they're coming. They're in the woods. They're probably all distracted by AI right now, but live shopping is going to explode. I believe most of you who are aspiring to be a creator, an influencer, a content creator, an influencer, a personal brand, I believe most of you are not good enough to become wildly famous. I think half of that group is good enough to sell stuff, whether around their house or start selling a product. I challenge the thousands of people watching right now to go to what not right now because on TikTok, you need a certain amount of followers to have a shop. Do you know what that number is? You don't remember, right? Thousand to go live and I think 5,000 to have a shop maybe. Let's get the right answer because I need it for my content. We'll get the real, real answer. You'll figure it out. I believe most of you in the next week must go live on what not. I highly recommend going live on what not. The problem with what not is you don't get audience for free. On TikTok, you get audience for free. The problem with TikTok is you get audience for free, but a lot of them are not looking to shop. On what not, even if you have 11 viewers, they're buying. Got it? What not's QVC? TikTok's more commerce team. But I think all of you should try to sell something this weekend. Everybody should have a who's ready for the Gary V's 2025 virtual garage sale challenge. Who's ready for Gary V's 2025 virtual garage sale challenge where you do a garage sale on what not today, meaning this Saturday. You're going to gather stuff in your house. You're going to gather stuff in your house. You're going to download what not. You're going to make a nice little profile. You're going to schedule a show and this Saturday, you're going to sell stuff around your house on what not. Who's ready? This takes work and all of you are saying yes in the chat now and 90% won't do it. I'm doing it this Saturday. Mike, you really made a huge mistake. You will, no, no, you have to understand if you don't do it this Saturday, I'm going to fire you. No, because I'll be a hypocrite. All right. No, I understand. Sid, please send me the link Saturday. That's on you now. I will watch you. Good job, Mike. So it's 5,000 for TikTok to do what I want them to do, but it's you don't need any followers on what not. The problem is when you go live on what not, you included Mike, you need to, you need to, here's the hack. Ready? I need everybody who's doing the Gary V 2025 virtual garage sale challenge to set up a what not, set up the show and then the link to the show. You have to then text everybody on Friday night in your phone from Adam Anderson to Zachary Zasloff. You need to text them the link to your show and say, hey, can you check out my garage sale tomorrow? I know you're not going to do that because most people are scared to do that. I see the fear in your face, Mike. I know I'm scared. Question is from Fatima. I'm a 23 year old computer engineer turned baker. I built the fairy who bakes to 229K followers, published a cookbook and even got followed by The Rock. Thanks to you, I followed my passion after graduating. I'm now testing new content styles but feel stuck in the same niche. What would you focus on to evolve this into a global brand, especially with the US audience while living in Lebanon? Patience. I was just two seconds in. Like I had 229,000 followers once. Bless you. I had 229,000 followers once. Like I didn't stress at 229. I was excited at 229 to get to 500,000, to get to a million, to get to 2 million, to 4 million. You know, like people struggle with patience. They want everything now. They want it now, Erin. Like she's doing great. She's actually living the life that 99% of the audience here right now is hoping to live. So Erin, it's very easy. Like she's winning but she's slowed down on her growth and so now she thinks she's losing. It's like any progress with anything. If you run, if you work out, if you're trying to lose weight, if you're trying to get muscles, you know, like basketball, you want to get better at pool, like whatever, you know, chess, people grow, then they hit a plateau. That is normal. And in that plateau is when you need to be grateful for the growth you just had and most people don't go with gratitude. They go with envy and jealousy of other people that got bigger muscles, sold more cupcakes, lost more weight. We deploy envy and jealousy in moments when we should be deploying gratitude. There it is. I'm pretty happy about that clip right there. That is it right there. We are deploying envy and jealousy, which triggers our lack of patience in moments when we should be deploying gratitude for the accomplishments, the micro accomplishments that we just had. Okay, this question is from Hector. I have two very young kids, two boys ages six and two. I began my own consulting business seven years ago and it's doing really well. However, it keeps me away from my family a lot more than I would like. I'm curious as a dad yourself on how to move past the feeling of regret when I miss moments with my kids due to my commitment with work. Listen, this is as hard as it gets. There is no right answer. There is who's the judge and jury of whether you spent enough time or didn't. I spent so much more time with my kids than my dad that I felt like I was a superhero. In hindsight, there was more time to be had and they might have things to say when they're older and then they'll live their lives. You just do the best you can. We have to stop beating ourselves up on this. You're trying to provide for your family. People don't get it. We went through this whole era where moms and dads that were providing were getting demonized. Who the fuck do you think is paying for? Shit. How the fuck do you live? There is that part and as long as you're actually giving a fuck, as long as you love your kids and you're trying your best and you're not bullshitting and you're not fucking golfing and bowling and running away, you're genuinely trying. By the way, I've met a lot of 20-year-olds who talk about my parents showed me how to live instead of told me how to live. Oh, by the way, Rips, did your parents go to your games when you were a kid? Do you remember every game you ever played, every minute and every time they were there? Of course not. I watched a bunch of DailyVees. I think I have the best memory in the world. I watched a bunch of DailyVees when I was drawing V-Friends. When I was drawing V-Friends, four years ago, five years ago, me, Tyler, D-Rock, Andy, we watched old DailyVees. I didn't remember anything. And they were only like five years ago. I was like, okay, we have a very confused POV on what we remember. You're not going to remember every single thing. You're going to remember how you felt. And if this father, what's his name? Hector. If his kids feel like Hector gave a fuck, that's all that's needed. The end. This is a binary game for parents. Do your kids think you gave a fuck or not? The end, not the every little recital and sports game and afternoon. And by the way, what about being present when you're there? I know all sorts of parents. I have buddies who are degenerates who are home at 5 p.m. from work all the time. They're there. You're a good one. They're there, but they're fucking watching SportsCenter and drinking beers and farting and not giving a shit about their kids. What about that part? There's also that. So I don't know. We need to stop beating ourselves up. All right, Lewis, it's good. Hello, how's it going? I can hear you. Louder would be better. What's good, Lewis? How's it going, UK? I'm good, brother. Where are you from? I'm from England, just outside of London. Very nice. Yeah, yeah. Big fan, by the way. Big fan. Thank you, man. So basically, I'm an actor. I'm a 24-year-old actor and I've been an actor for about two years now. And my career is definitely on the rise. Like, I'm sort of getting my name out there in the horror world and stuff like that. And my name is sort of getting established. However, with acting, it's so sporadic. I've had some jobs where I earn a lot of money and then I have a few months where it's a bit coming in. So it's kind of that idea of, like, do I start a side hustle whilst going in on my passion? Or does that take too much time away from acting? Or do I go all into the acting? A side hustle is perfect because it doesn't take time away from acting. It allows you to do shit when the acting is slow. Yes, okay. You're not doing two careers. You understand, brother? Like, that's why side hustles are awesome because they're not actually taking away. They're there to circumvent the moments of downtime. Yeah, it's just because, like, I started a fitness business like a few months ago. I didn't really take off and it was taking a lot of time away from my acting. So I'm almost panicked and thinking like, with acting, that you've got to learn your lines. And if you're on set as well, stuff slows down on the side. So it's finding that side hustle to still do all the things of acting. I've got a good side hustle for you. Make social media content of you sharing your thoughts, your feelings, your dreams, and your observations. It will build your profile and will help your acting. Oh, I do it on the same Instagram account I use for acting. I'll do a separate account, which is saying... You can do both. Either works. What is your Instagram? So mine's called LewisSanta.actor and it's all just acting stuff on there. So I put clips in me acting, films I've been in, like events... Can you spell that out because you went too fast in your accent and fucked up a bunch of us Americans? Oh, sorry. I put it in the chat. It's LewisSanta.actor. I don't know if people can see that. There it is. We can. Yep. So that's my acting account. But I always worry about doing videos of me speaking to camera because it's like, are people thinking, is he an actor or a content creator? Or is that getting in my head too much? I just say, fuck it. That's getting in your head too much. It's the same shit. This is why I love your content because you always have the idea of like just saying, fuck it and just doing it and just seeing how it goes. Because that's how life actually works. Yeah. The reason my shit works is I live real life and all of you live life in your head grounded in security and fear. Yeah. So I think that's it. I think it was to have acted as well. It's one of those things you need to get out of your head and it's like with content creation, it's a new thing for me anyway. All 1000 people right now, the ones on what not and the ones on all my other social, all of them are in their fucking head. Yeah. Yeah. And then it was 90 and says, why did I live in my head? Yeah. That's literally how that's life. Everybody spends 80 to 90 years in their head and they turn 90 and they say, why the fuck did I live in my head? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea though. Starting a content thing on the side is a really good idea because it's like my passion. I love talking about it with people, but it is that idea of like, how am I being perceived online? I know. I went down that route. That is not going to have it. In fact, it will not have a detriment to you being an actor, but it might be the contributor to you being an actor. Oh, I see. He's getting the name out there more. Yeah, brother. Somebody may see you, may see something in you when you're ranting about your favorite football team. And that might be the reason you're an actor because they see that you're an actor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They see my personality through that. Yeah. Cause I saw one of your TED talks talking about, it's all about attention acting and that's something I'm struggling with is like, it's pouring that getting that attention into you, you know, getting put yourself out on Instagram, on TikTok and stuff like that. Brother, the internet and social media have not changed us. It's exposed us, which now allows us to fix it. The internet also has allowed for people like me to live in here. I'm helping our youngster here right now. He couldn't find me pre-internet. He would just have other fear coming at him from the mainstream media. Yeah. The internet has been a net positive yet everyone thinks it's been a net negative because we don't want to be accountable for the truth. It's just mindset stuff. We used to hide the truth. Yeah. Sexual orientation, suicide, depression, alcoholism, domestic abuse, this shit hid, motherfuckers. This was all in the shadows of our society. You can't hide in a social internet world. Thus, now we get to, do you know how you fix things? By exposing them. By going to therapy, by shedding light on things. We're fixing the world right now because of social media and people can't see it because we're in the middle of the fix and people don't like being in the middle of the fix. Becoming sober when you're an alcoholic, that beginning sucks. Addressing your insecurities and your shortcomings and therapy and becoming accountable, that sucks. This is an important time in the human race. We are fixing. This is a very, very big thing I just said for the last two minutes that a lot of you don't see it. No, I get it. I went sober about a year ago and I get it. It's the first couple of months is to be that fucking sucks. And it is accepting the problem that you have in facing yourself in the mirror. Do you know what I mean? And then after a few months, then it just gets smooth sailing from there. That's what I think anyway. Proud of you, brother. Real pleasure to talk to you. Have the best day. Okay. Who won Iowa? With love from Iowa. Here we go. Everybody that did not enter the giveaway on what not, you suck. All right. Here we go. Eagle. I like Eagle. Whoa. Eagle and pig. Our kit book. Oh, there's a manga. We got a hit. I like that we just talked about accountability. The accountable and eater. So apropos. Let me go to the fourth card. Sweet swan, which ribs, you agree with me, has been gaining some momentum. I feel like sweet swans in a little bit of a moment. OGV friends, collectors, leave a comment and one not if you agree with me. It feels like sweet swan is going from like tier five to four to three. Like it feels like it's in a moment. And the manga is the wise wasp. It's a nice little five to $15 card. Is that right, rips? Yep. 10 bucks. All right. Now let's sign. We're going to go with the accountable and eater because it's a color match. Iowa. Congratulations for getting free money. I worked for the bank for six years now. Not something I love, but you know, pays the bills, gets everything done. I worked at a zoo before this. Love that energy, everything there. Bounce with animals. You know, I capped out at the tap I can do. I'm thinking about making a big change. You know, if I have friends in law enforcement, they say, come on over. You know, it takes a pair of you, but it's kind of, you know, I got three kids kind of in the air. What do you think? Is it sometimes I should take the plunge on, you know, do you want to do law enforcement? It doesn't feel like it's always been in the back of my mind. Has it? No, it's always been there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's just been there. So let me let me now it's I got for I'm so glad you're here. Let me give you a quick answer before you get fired here. You can always go back to jobs like the one you have right now. Yeah. This is the number one thing that people don't understand. Jobs like the one you're in right now are always there waiting for someone like you that's scared to make the jump into something they're passionate about or really want to do. Do you know what I mean? Risk adverse jobs are everywhere. Yeah. The end. That's true. So it's not if it's not this bro, if it's not this bank, if you go jump right and let's say you're like, oh, fuck, I hate this even more. I quote unquote want to go back a different version of the same job is there for you. Sometimes this exact job is there for you. Yeah, that's true. And the and here's my biggest point of view. If someone is asking me this question, they're looking for someone they admire or love or like or are they're homey to give them one last push to actually do it. You're looking for my validation, which means you're ready, ready to do it. I don't ask questions of people to give me validation for things I'm not even considering to do. You're not asking me for validation to go be a parachute, you know, you know, or go be a clown in a circus. You're you're asking for something that you've already decided you want to do. You see where I'm going, my guy? Yeah, yeah. On the back end, too, I've been training like it's weird. I've been training a little bit on the side with some friends like you can do it. You'll be fine. Like it's not an issue of mine, but just like the change with security with jobs and things like that. It's a big change. Yeah, you kids. I'm so with you, but I'm telling you, you can go to a job like this in five seconds. Yeah. If the yeah, just as quick as I got it, I can do it again. And by the way, you know, so many of us are so grateful for good people and law enforcement and so we could use you out there. I appreciate it. Awesome. Awesome, brother. Love you. Oh, yeah. If you don't know what's going on with V friends, I am building a positive and optimistic, but accountable and tenacious universe called V friends with great characters like the balanced beetle. And who I like this one rips patient pig and a yellow refractor, a little color batch with that little booty that the fire, the firelight comes with the yellow refractor fly fire fly is in the mix. And the final card is major moth. Let's get into it. Aaron, what's the first question? This is a question from Diego. I own a fitness studio that has grown enough that I need to hire tips on how not to fuck this up. I know this will allow me to grow my business to the next level. The way you really learn is is by firing, Aaron. It's not it's not that hard. It's not fun to fire. But if you make the wrong mistake hiring, the anecdote, the formula, the way you solve is called hiring and people are really hesitant to hire because they're scared to fuck it up. Hence the question. What's up, Pablo? So my big thing is hire fast. Go with your intuition. Don't overthink it. Fire faster and then promote fastest. So very quickly after you hire, you're going to know if you've got someone you can work with. You know, not withstanding like random things that happen in people's lives. Sometimes I think about something recently where we had a great employee and something in a personal life situation changed that variable. But for the most part, many of the people that are sitting around here right now, it was obvious within a week or two, like, okay, there's like some real something really here to play with. And on the on the reverse, there are many people that are not sitting here right now in this office that very quickly we knew. And so that's that Valerie asks, how do I know if I'm built for entrepreneurship or if I'm just romanticizing it by even asking that question? Let me let me be very honest this morning because I'm in the mood. When you're an entrepreneur, actually, do you know those bugs? I say I use this analogy a lot. You know the fly, you know, in the summer, you have that like zappy light thing on the porch because you don't want the mosquitoes in the bugs and the bugs just go to it and die and like the bugs can't help it. They're so drawn to the blue light, they can't help it. They probably even I don't underestimate bugs. I think bugs actually know they're going to die. They just can't help it. That's almost like being an entrepreneur. You almost are very likely going to die, but you can't help it and you believe you can live. There was no option for me. There was no option for everyone that I've really met that's an actual entrepreneur. Now, we live in an era where people want to take a stab at entrepreneurship. People are dabbling. They're experimenting. You know how like high school kids go to college freshman year. Normally girls and they'll experiment a little bit. You know what I'm saying? That's what I see people are doing now with entrepreneurship. They want to experiment a little, you know, but they're getting caught because it's not really who they are, you know, and so, you know, I think it's, I think it's a, I think what's really cool is I'm thrilled that people are trying it out. And that's amazing to me and exciting. But I think if you have to ask, you're definitely not a pure bread entrepreneur and to be a successful entrepreneur, often you have to be pure bread. And I do see people learning and getting there, but they had like 90 percent of it there. You know what I mean? And so that's how I see it. Anyway, thank you everybody for watching.
