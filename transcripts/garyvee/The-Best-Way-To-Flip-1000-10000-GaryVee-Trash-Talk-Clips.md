the only way I know for somebody who has time, which is the one asset, and a little bit of money, the number one thing is flipping. You can't do much with $1,000. So for me, the one place to take $1,000 and make it $10,000 is garage sales and flea markets and thrift stores and dollar stores, buying and selling, Marshalls, TJ Maxx, it's all just work. Download the Amazon and eBay apps, scan shit for an hour or two, and people are just not putting in the work, right? As a new flipper, what product do you think I should? Everything, at night, at night, you should be laying in bed at night, searching like hats. But how do you think I figured out mug life? Oh, all right. I was like, I see a lot of mugs at garage sales. Do mugs sell for anything? Search on eBay mugs, completed items, sold, sort by fucking price. Holy shit, there's $88 mugs, there's $63 mugs, there's $96 mugs, then go buy a bunch of mugs for a quarter, come home, look them up, educate, educate, educate. The key to flip life is the homework you do at night from 10 to midnight during the week that you fucking then leverage on Saturday when you kill it with your fucking knowledge. That's freaking tactical, like that's super tactical, but I don't know where you can take, go like, where do I start? What do you mean when an eBay completed items? Search eBay app, search, literally, fucking, I'm gonna show you. I'm so freaking new, I'm just off for a ride. I'm so dumb. eBay, right? Okay, go. Okay, now you're going to garage sales, you're like, oh shit, I see a lot of salt and pepper shakers, right? Salt and pepper shakers, you're like, I see a lot of them. Then you go to filter, sold and completed items, sort, highest price, and then you're like, oh shit. Oh shit. $441, $600, $1,000. Like this little bird is 325 mugs. You're not buying this little fucking bird at a fucking garage sale if you don't know. It's $350. Who bought this for three individuals? Salt and pepper shaker fucking collectors. Salt and pepper shakers. Why would people buy speakers for 500? They collect them. Why do people buy shirts? They collect them. Why do people buy bracelets? They like them. People buy everything, everything can be flipped. Got you, got it. How many addresses? 38. There's 38? Then they were listed on something? Any, good job by you. That's a good job. I think it's more than 38. That's a key team. Google town-wide garage sale and then put in your state. And then. The date is the key. Yeah, you gotta always put in. It's probably September 10th. That's right. Thank you, Lou. Lou's right. Put in town-wide garage sale, date and your state. And that's how you find town-wides. The reason that's important is back to the gas, the efficiency, the maximizing. Going to a town-wide sale where there's 30, 40, 50, 100 garage sales versus going to, you know what, make this right. Going to just six for the same amount of two hours is obviously a very big difference. And so that's why that's very much on my mind. See, that's a professional garage sale sign. I already know that it's bad. Because she has a sign? Because the sign's too professional. That means they do it often. Joe, she's doing. Yeah, and just everything's overpriced and been worked through for everybody. The professional signs, they're the wackest. Like, I knew it. That lady sells every week. That pissed me off. I can tell you already, it's not going to be a good garage sale. Let me tell you why. Because of the sign. The reason this garage sale's not going to be good is the garage sale sign is too bad. It means these people do garage sales all the time. I promise when we go right now, it's going to feel more like a flea market than a garage sale. But we'll see. But the sign's too reused. They do it often. Top things to look for at a garage sale. Number one, electronics. They're everywhere, they just work. Number two, stuffed animals. Absolutely everywhere, 25 and 50 cents. If you have a tiny budget, $10 on the flip, you keep about seven. You always charge shipping. Stuffed animals are a huge, huge game. Mug life, play the clips. Let's go dive a mug. Let me just dismantle that. I like the mug life. Mug life. It says to get one free on the mugs. See ya, take care. All right, now, the fun part. Life is good mug. Can't find it exactly. But let's call this an easy 10 spot. Next, Denny's. You're not going to leave this. 11, 14 bucks all day. This is just a vintage one, but just for fun. Holy shit, 12 bucks for two of them. One day, people will be buying beef friends, mugs, and garage sales, and the whole thing will be full circle. You know I love that mug life. Again, a lot of my thinking is for people that have less than $50 to spend these 25 and 50 cent mugs that go for 10 to 25 a piece really, really matter. And number four, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys. Prediction. Greatest. Garage sale. Hold on. Hi, I would love some lemonade. Thank you. You keep the change, okay? My gosh, thank you so much. You're welcome. Worth 20 bucks. Give me one minute. Yeah. Good lemonade. By the way, it was right about the, it was right about the greatest garage sale ever. Got to pay 20 bucks to a young girl, the silver face. How awesome is that? That was my face in 1985 when that bike rider dropped by and gave me a $10 bill. I'll never forget it to this, literally for the rest of my life. I bought over $10,000 worth of playbills from Broadway from 1940 to 1980 for 20 bucks. How many playbills? Probably that collection probably had for 3000 playbills, about 3000 playbills from the 40s to the 80s at a garage sale in Cranford, New Jersey for $20. How much is seven for it? Me and AJ broke down that collection and probably sold at least $7,000, $8,000 worth of playbills. And we probably still have in the attic 50% of it. Jesus. There was also like a Pinocchio 1941 movie. Like, you know, there was also a bunch of Brooklyn Dodgers 1950s game. It was unbelievable.
