## Transcript
Do you know how many kids are about to become millionaires because they understand AI? If you're a 22-year-old, it's the best that ever happened to you because it's a tidal wave and you're still young and spry where you can grab the board and ride this wave. When you're 72 and this tidal wave comes and you're like, mother, you're kind of like, okay, I'm just gonna put my head in the sand and let this thing kill me. When you're 22, what the fuck are you crying about? So either you shouldn't cry about it because you're fear-based or realize this is the biggest financial opportunity for somebody under the age of 25 ever. Yeah! Hey! Thank you. Of course! Hey, brother, such a pleasure. Nice to meet you. How are you? I'm doing well, how are you? Hello. Hi, Nicole. Nicole, Gary, so nice to meet you. Are we good? Awesome. Let's do it. Beautiful. You grew up, I'm a Jersey boy also. Where'd you grow up? I grew up in Park Ridge. No way. In Montfiel. I know well. And Edison, though, I know Edison, where you come from, as that was the White Castle. I can't believe you know that. Yeah, that's... That we would travel to. It's funny, and there was also a White Diamond. A White Diamond. In Clark, which was about a 15 minute, 12 minute drive from where I grew up in Edison. Yeah. And that was like the OG of even White Castle. So their sliders were even crazier. Like, you know, like, you know how those places, like the reason it tastes so good is because all the gunk on the grill. Totally, rut's hut in the cliff. 100%. I think the White Diamond in Clark, New Jersey, which I don't think is still there, was like the greatest slider I've ever had. The best. Oh man, we would just get road trips to Edison. That's how, that's my only thing. I mean, as recently as like five to seven years ago, I would literally go to Route 22 in Jersey, in Springfield to go to a White Castle. Like, would go out of my way. So good. So good. And they're still rolling. Well, this is nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. Normally, if I have time, depending on the schedule and if we were in LA, I would have baked you bread. That's very kind. But I got you bread. That's very nice. From this beloved bakery. This is already been ROI positive, this entire podcast. This doesn't, they're not a sponsor, I just love them. I love it. It's called Bread's Bakery. This guy just killed it. Thank you, Robert. This is gonna be your olive loaf. Thank you. And then I don't know if this is culturally correct. Go ahead. Belarus? Yes. I thought maybe chocolate babka. Oh, that's very nice. Right? Well, I'm already eating everyone. There you go. I like it. Thank you so much. There's nothing better than the one that guests just eats immediately. Yeah. Thank you so much. You hear a lot. You're very good about sparking people. And getting them kind of out of their rut and make them at least think about what they're gonna do and how they're gonna go. You hear a lot about start a business, do a thing, do a thing. You start this business and do these things when it's just you and you have no money to hire people to work with you. Social media. It's the greatest, it's so funny where social is now. Yeah. It's in such a bad place as a brand because of the political unrest. It's confused people that it's the greatest opportunity to humans ever. Brother, literally, let's use an example I know of which is similar to this bread thing. God, I don't wanna get this wrong. There's a woman that I just came across is it bread or is my brain just breaking because you've got bread in front of me? There's a woman. Yeah. Is it cookies? I'm just, you know what, I don't wanna make this up. There's a woman I've recently come across who either sells bread, cookies, pickles, cupcakes. I just can't remember. I apologize audience. But she literally is good at it. She saw my content, she said, fuck it, I'll just start posting about it. And long story short, just by posting on Instagram and TikTok two years later, she makes $750,000 a year take home, baking her fucking thing and shipping it to people around the country. And she's a pig in shit happy and it's changed her life. She is not the enigma. She is the preview of what everything is gonna happen. I've been thinking about writing a new book called The Individual Empire. Right? This balloon, you like it? I like it too. Thank you, that was positive reinforcement, thank you. The concept of the book is we are in a place now between social, live shopping, YouTube, streaming, Twitch and kick and all that. I'm sure you see the young comics and all that, Drew Ski, right? The blockchain, which people still don't understand, the NFT is Bitcoin. But I do. All these different pieces, we are dangerously close to where everybody in a decade can make a living around things that they love, are interested in, talking about Star Trek, talking about old video games, talking about rock bands of the 70s and being able to sell merch, being able to get brand sponsorship. And you were one TikTok post away from your life changing and that is happening at scale to people every day, brother. Right, yeah, yeah. Look at the SNL crew, Marcelo, this new kid, Patterson who just joined, they're all growing up from social content. Right, yeah. You had to fucking work it. You had to go into, there are people whose lives changed from one silly video. Yeah, exactly. Didn't have to go to a club, didn't have to get hired by anybody. Nobody had a stat part, brother, you get it. This is the part that's lost, people don't get it. There used to be gatekeepers. You're good enough to be on TV. You're good enough to be on this stage. Now it's just you in the market. That's right. So I don't know, I think we're living in the greatest theater of opportunity. So the answer is how do you do it? It's social media. I think it starts with passion. I don't think you can work the 10 hours a day or while you have a full-time job, when you get home after a long day, how are you possibly gonna muster up the energy from 7 p.m. to midnight to work on something unless whatever you're doing is something you like? Yeah. So like if you like, pause, I'll give you, I'll just keep going with what I know to be true. Which I think may spark some ideas for people. Puzzles. You know what I'm talking about brother? Puzzles, jigsaw puzzles. There's people like doing those. Yeah. Filming yourself putting together a jigsaw puzzle. If that's actually what you wanna do over beer and watching Love Island in the background. Filming yourself and posting clips of that on TikTok. Genuinely actually, if you got a little something, if you got consistency and perseverance, if you learn a little something. Yeah. Literally leads to, if you do it consistently for two years, leads to you being on the other side at bare minimum brother, getting $5,000 a year in brand deals from jigsaw puzzle companies that gives you $5,000 more than you had before. Right, yeah. That's worst case if you're consistent for two years. Yeah. Best case, you quit your job you hate and you are jigsaw Jane. And you make 180 a K a year for jigsaw Jane T-shirts. 50,000 in brand deals from the five biggest jigsaw companies, a $10,000 appearance at jigsaw con. This is real. Yeah. And you know what's funny? I was saying this shit in 0809010 and people laughed at me. All of you know what I just said is real. Right. It's real. Is it getting more crowded to the point where it's not even close? The opportunity is even bigger than it was before. Yes, you know what? Everybody, this is so funny. This is the greatest opportunity in human history and what do humans do? They're like Gary, but there's everybody else is doing it too. I'm like no shit Sherlock. But that's why this is an opportunity. And that's why I noticed the examples I gave jigsaw. You gotta go niche or a niche or. Right. Jigsaw and a beer where you like, notice what I'm about to do. You both like, you like the new jigsaw but you're also a micro brew connoisseur and you know micro brews. So now what's your point of differentiation? You're doing the jigsaw, you're making your content but you're also real quick. Let me tell you about this rogue IPA and all of a sudden it's the beer part that took off. And that's where you're making your money, not the jigsaw or both or you're the only beer jigsaw person. Yeah. You're niche as you. Right. Like I'm a Jets fan, root beer, garage sale, like all the things you know. Yeah. There's other people that talk about business and opportunity and social media and motivation and practical. But the more you give the world every little nuance of you, the more likely you have a point of differentiation. What's cool about it is that it's, everything you've said today comes from a passion and the love. It all comes from whether you're dealing with kids or whether you're dealing with building these companies or dealing with your parents or all of these things. They're not fake things. They're not looking at the market and saying, what would possibly make a lot of money that I can kind of exploit and then show up and try and sell something that you're not into? That's right. Or sell something that I think people are buying. People chased crypto. People chase real estate. People chase cannabis. People chasing AI right now. They're not passionate about those things. They think the money's there. Right. Right. And I just, I don't know. Maybe this is why I was an F student. Like I was a real bad student. Yeah. Like real bad. Yeah. Like two, my class rank was 243 out of 251. There was like eight people worse than me at North Hunterton High School in New Jersey. I just don't know how to do things if I don't like them. And so like I failed school my whole life. I literally can't hang a picture on the wall. Right. But I can build empires. Yeah. And I think, I believe that's true for everyone. Meaning, not everyone is a good entrepreneur and a good business person. I get that. Yeah. But if you understand what you're good at. Yeah. Or what, more importantly, more importantly, what you like and then please hopefully you're good at it. Cause then it's instant. Or if not, you can get good at it. Right. I think there's something there. I'm not going to keep you long, but I've got to tell you about GaryVee.com slash stan. Stan Store, an incredible tech stack for creator entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial creators is literally the tech stack based on what I wrote in Crush It and Crushing It. And really the thing almost all of you are trying to build. So if you are one of those people, go to the GaryVee challenge that I've partnered up with this investment I made in Stan Store. I believe in this. I believe in it for you. You'll see why I love it. GaryVee.com slash stan. Go check it out. Now back to the video. I can't let you leave without asking something about AI. Please. Because you're talking about it a lot. And I'm not even going to ask you a question. Tell me, tell them, what, if you're a young person and you're scared of AI, I'm going to ask you a question. And you were scared of AI and people, you just hear... Well, if you're young... You hear rumblings that all the jobs are going to go away. What do you say to young people about the AI revolution that's upon us? That the only class you should pay attention to is history or do it on your free time. Because when the tractor was invented and the automobile and the typewriter and the computer, they all said the same thing. Right. And by way, for anybody who really understands, AI is big. Like it is bigger than the things I just mentioned, but I will say this again. When the tractor was invented, 80% of the world worked on a farm. Right. If you're a young kid and worried about this, you're a fucking idiot. This is your biggest opportunity. I understand if it's an OG like you and me, you're like, ah, fuck, we got to learn something new. We're old dogs, we just want to eat the same fucking bone. If you're a 22 year old, it's the best shit that ever happened to you. Why? Because it's a tidal wave and you're still young and spry where you can grab the board and ride this wave. When you're 72 and this tidal wave comes and you're like, mother fucker, you're kind of like, fucking, I'm just gonna put my head in the sand and let this thing kill me. When you're 22, what the fuck are you crying about? Some jobs will go away. Many jobs will go away. You know what else is gonna happen? Millionaire kids. Do you know how many kids are about to become millionaires because they understand AI? So either bitch and cry about it because you're fear based or realize this is literally the biggest financial. We're talking about a financially right now. Because we're talking about jobs. This is the biggest financial opportunity for somebody under the age of 25 ever. Ever. Bigger than the internet in 94. And where do they? It depends on you deploy it. So for example, let me explain what I mean by that. If you're a 17 year old smart kid, you can literally call every local business and be like, hey, I'll build your new website, your website's old. They're like, how much? You're like 500 bucks. They're like, wait, my last quote was 4,000. You're like, yeah, 500. You know why? You can build in a fucking minute with AI. Right. Yeah. I mean, I can literally sit here for 24 straight hours on Sirius and tell people 9,000 examples of where AI can do that for you. Right. Yeah. It's a profound. And they're not gonna do it themselves so you go out and use it. And by the way, everyone's about to ask this. So let me say it. The way you learn about AI is with AI. Go to chatGPT. Right. Go to Proplexity. Go to Gemini. And literally type in, I'm ready? Let's go through it. And this is profound. Like this is how you watch this. I'm gonna do it in real time. I'm going to chatGPT. Here we go. Hey, Chadi. I call chatGPT Chadi. Hey, Chadi. I'm a 19 year old dude. I'm fairly ambitious. I hear AI is gonna take all these jobs. But then I heard Gary Vee on this podcast say that actually stop being a bitch and be scared, go on the offense and use AI. I'm a good hard worker if I'm motivated and I'm motivated by money. I need some cash. Cause all these girls out here, you know, the girls that are, they need the cash. I need some cash. What five businesses can I start if I'm willing to really work hard using AI to disrupt the incumbents that don't use AI that is kind of easy for a 19 year old that kind of knows tech, but I'm not a developer or anything, Chadi. I'm just a normal 19 year old that kind of understands tech. What's like a good thing? I live in Topeka, Kansas in a 100 mile radius. Like what things should I be looking at where I could have a huge advantage? So first of all, why would I just did was important. A lot of people are using chatGPT and AI like they use Google search. Notice how I did a very different thing there. First, I use my voice cause I'm much stronger communicator on voice than I am typing. Second, I'm very, I'm very, very specific cause I want people, here's my answer, got it, Chadi here. I like your energy. You don't need to code or AI. Here we go. Local marketing agency 2.0. My world. You could take money from Gary V and VaynerMedia. The path, every roofer, landscaper, dentist, HVAC company, lawyer in Topeka is still posting blurry Facebook photos and paying outdated agencies. Your advantage, use AI to pump out clean branding, TikTok ads and even customer service chatbots. You can use Canva AI, ChatGPT or Opus Clip. You can look at a big time creative agency and almost no overhead and be a competitor to them. How to start? Walk into 10 local businesses and say, hey, I run a TikTok, Instagram, Google ad business for $500 a month and I can get you leads in 30 days or you don't have to pay me. I mean this gets, and then you can follow up. The next one was real estate content machine. The next one is AI powered resume and college essay business. High school and college kids around Topeka need jobs and scholarship. Parents will pay for professional polish. Use ChatGPT or others to help write resumes, essays, cover levers and package it with a Canva design template and charge $50 to $150 each. This will take you three to seven minutes and probably $4 of effort. That's pretty great. I think I'm gonna do that, the resume part. This is really important shit. We are now in an era where you don't need to follow my content to come up with the ideas. You just ask AI to help you get good at AI. And keep asking it. And keep asking it, keep talking to it. Keep saying yes. Just when they're like, and would you like me to come up with a plan? Yes. And now would you like me to implement that for you? I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you because you're clearly showing me in the way you're talking that you're starting to play. Yeah, completely. But here's the thing, every time I use it, my daughters and my eco-warrior daughters tell me that I'm ruining the planet. So I have to talk to my, I call them scoots. I have to talk to them quietly. Yeah. So I would tell your kids to stop being fucking hypocrites and ask them why they wear clothes. Cause the textile industry is doing plenty of damage to the environment. And we're gonna get better. I think AI is gonna fix the water problem. Don't forget, the AI energy electricity it uses, it's also offsetting, you know, there's that, but then there's also an offset. Everyone gets into this absolutism. Right. Like are you gonna be mad at AI using up electricity when you yourself are using a phone all day? Like what are you doing? Right. Like, and again, the reason I like using clothes, like tell her to your kids like clothes. Love clothes. Great, tell them to stop buying clothes. Right. It's damaging the environment. Right. Fast casuals destroying the world. Yeah, yeah. The hypocrisy. Yeah. Nothing is less effective than a hypocritical child. Right. It's funny, there's so many things I wanna talk about. You've been really influential and just on a business sense and a personal sense. It's been very cool watching you and getting a little wisdom from you. I was actually with my daughter this morning. We just dropped her at school and my wife was literally telling her, when you walk around campus, you know, she said it's weird, I see kids not saying hello to each other. And she's like, you should say hello. And my daughter's like, I know, but do you feel weird and you did this? And then I said, this is what I'm going to interview today. And I called up your Instagram and your post was when you're in college, say hello to everyone. It's literally my post. I literally brought you to the diner table. Literally on the way here, coming down my elevator, my company, my marketing company is also making content. They asked me the same question, what's your advice to kids going back to school today? And the clip you saw that was on my Instagram today was from four years ago. And I used it this morning. It's obviously tough, but it's really true, right? Like you and I have the luxury of living life a little bit now. It's people. Can we cross on this point? It's fucking people. I know. I don't understand how people don't understand that. I say that to young comics all the time. I said, just meet everybody. 100%. Only comedians are going to hire you. Literally, I love stand up and I love documentaries. And literally when you just said that, when I think about every documentary about a famous comedian I've watched in my life, which is probably at this point two dozen, every one of 30% of the doc is them telling you who they met when they were about to take the stage and change their career. Cause like, I like you kid. Why don't you come here with me in Austin, Texas? It's literally people. I always get goosebumps when I'm onto something really good. So I'm getting them right now. Like, honestly, this podcast is over. There's nothing else we're gonna say that's more valuable. It is people. It's always gonna be people. I don't give a fuck about the AI robots or all the other stuff you're all talking about. Your life is predicated on people. I know. And it's a weird thing watching kids go to school because the other thing that you talk about is self-esteem. And you remember, I remember in your 20s, early 20s, being at school, finding your way. I said, we watched two girls run across campus and like scream and hug each other. And it was like so over the top. You're missing young people when they're in the mall or whatever. Yeah. And it's, they're really screaming, I'm not alone. I'm not alone. I'm not alone. Here's, cause the rest of your time, they're just walking around, balled up thinking, what is someone thinking about me? Am I wearing the wrong thing? Did I say something stupid? It's such a, it's a weird thing when I was showing my daughter your clip to say put yourself out there when she's saying, it's a scary place to be. And what's funny brother is for everyone who's an R-age group that's listening, we grew up in those realities too. It's not like insecurity, even though we've come up with a new word called imposter syndrome. It's not like insecurity was null and void when we were growing up. The difference is, thankfully, we now talk more about feelings. Right. Our gen, and definitely the gen before us, everything was bottled the fuck up. Yeah, never spoke about it. Now, there's a lot of great that has come with all of us talking about this. There's also some downside. Oh yeah. We talk about so much, it becomes the conversation more than what we grew up with, which was, when you don't talk about it, bottling up is bad. It's got a lot of vulnerabilities, but its strength is a lot of us just learned how to eat shit and persevere. And just get through it. Yeah. Right now, we're in this word vomit of dwelling in every shortcoming that has crippled a society. And by the way, this is not a Gen Z issue. For everyone who's listening, there's no context on me. I have 50 million followers or so across social, but it's not because I've ever had a big platform. I've never been a TV star or an athlete. For the last 15 years, I've amassed a following through my content day by day. And the way I did it from 2007 to 11, which was my first era, was literally replying to every person that ever interacted with me, all of them. And then I started to talk about not tactics, like do this for marketing or do this for your business. I started talking about psychology because I started to realize in 2012, I woke up after five years of telling people what to do on Facebook and Twitter. And I was like, why aren't people doing this? And I started to realize I took for granted the self-esteem that my mother parented me with. I'm like, oh, you're not making content because you don't want somebody to say you're ugly or you're stupid, you're dumb. And so my content in 14, 13, 15 started to shift a little bit deeper than tactics and business marketing opportunities to the psychology of it all. When that became the case, I'm now at a place where I'm getting about 10,000 DMs a day from young women and men like your daughter. When you're a psycho like me and you read it all because you wanna have the pulse of society, you start to realize a lot of things I talk about now, which is what I've just mentioned. So that's giving everyone context of where my opinions are formed. I don't think I'm right. I think I'm a vessel of what I'm reading at scale. And what is very clear is we are completely stuck keeping up with the Joneses, the Kardashians, and any other person in the world that you're throwing at us. And unlike when you and I grew up, when Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous was on, that would be like fantasy land. And you'd be like, oh my God, Robin Leach is, look at these people. It was almost like, it wasn't that it wasn't achievable. I can tell you that when MTV Cribs came out later, and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous before that, people did not consume that content and felt like shit. Right, that's right. That's right. It was like, oh, that's cool or that's interesting or maybe one day, right? We've gotten into a place of insecurity where when somebody's going through their social media stream and they see someone else's success, it's triggering really deep unhappiness. And that is not the algorithms fault and that is not Instagram's fault. That is modern parenting's fault. Yeah. And by the way, I'm a modern parent. I have teenage kids. How old are your kids? 16 and 13. 16 and 13. And I don't sit here as like, you know, I hate when people talk from a place of not knowing. So like, when people are like, parenting sucks. I'm like, you're 22, you have no idea what the fuck you're talking. Like, I'm in it. And I'm definitely in it from the outside of getting all these DMs, millions over the last seven to 10 years. We're over-controlling. Yeah. And by the way, you know this, it's fucking hard because we love the fuck out of these little fuckers. Right. Like, on the record, I have no judgment on any parent that over-controlls their child. It's not judgment. It's just black and white obvious. Yeah. No, it really is. And like, if you buy everything for them and you yell at their teachers for them and you yell at their coaches for them, brother, do you know how bad it's gotten? We had an interview lined up with somebody the other day, a 24 year old who asked before the interview if their parent could come to the interview. Oh. Yeah. And by the way, you're a young lady and you just made that face. You're a young lady. And what I'm saying is people don't realize where this goes. No. Whereas like a 32 year old just heard that and they're like, what the fuck, what a bitch. But they don't realize what they were doing eight years ago, which was softer than 50 year olds, was the precursor of the extremity of how we got here. It's like the political landscape, right? Yeah. We're in this shit spot because the left goes more left, the right goes more right and you find yourself like, what the fuck are we? Same with what's going on with insecurity. It has become a pandemic. Yeah, it really has. And but the one parenting thing that is trickier with that is the dangers because of social media that you see the kids have like real scary stuff. Like suicide? Yeah. But suicide, where is that coming from? Right? As they eat more bread, by the way, everyone, this bread's delicious. Where's suicide actually coming from? I don't know. Well, let's talk about it. Yeah. I would argue. Yeah. Let me give you a left field one. Okay. I don't want you off guard, but you know my content well enough that you might have heard it from me, but I'm doing it for your audience here. Yeah, go for it. This is, so I think that indifference is very scary. That to get to a child or a grown up to a place where nothing matters is a series of events. So one of the reasons, brother, that I got crazy about eighth place trophies, for all the parents that have an under seven year old right now, I want you to listen very carefully because we're going into the fall right now and a lot of sports is coming. I'm going to say this slow because I desperately hope this helps someone. If you are lucky enough, I'm choosing my words very, very specifically. If you are lucky enough to have a six year old child who is about to cry this weekend because they lost their soccer game or their baseball game, please do not tell that winner that it's just a game. Yeah. What I think when you look, there's many things that get into dark places. Yeah. I think telling people that things don't matter, especially someone who was born with the ability to care, is a very dangerous path. The other thing that is a left field one. So that's a left field one. Somebody listening right now be like, Gary went there. That ain't different. Eight place trophies is linked. Whoa, Gary, that's fine. I'm just putting it on a shelf. I'll let you think about it. I'm not saying it is. I'm saying there's a lot of things that I've researched that scares me of how true that could be. Let me give you another one. Opposite side of parenting. I'm gonna say this nice and slow with detail and every word being purposeful with the desperation that this may help a parent listening right now. If you have a 27 year old child and you give them money, you are telling them through your actions that you think they're a loser and when a kid thinks their parents thinks they're a loser, that is bad. I'm gonna lower that age to 20. My age actually is 22, like day after college. It's either 18 or 22, but I gave a little grace because I don't know your audience too well and I don't want them to hate me too much right off the top. They're gonna high five you for that. I mean, and I'm telling you, when I say this, and I say it publicly a lot, I get 40, 50, 700 DMs in a week and I read them and they're like, Gary, you don't get it. My son just needs a little boost. I'm like, you don't get it. Because I'm getting your DM from your son saying I fucking hate my parents. Brother, this is DMs I get. Hey Gary, saw you say this on the popular, you know? Yeah. You're right, I fucking hate my parents. They fucking pay for my apartment. I have unlimited Uber and Starbucks and Equinox and I fucking hate them. I'm a psycho, so sometimes I'll reply. I'll be like, hey, do you want help? Of course, right away, yes. Stop taking their money, asshole. Right. Like, can you imagine the audacity we're in where kids are angry at their parents for paying for their lifestyle? For giving them too much. But I think that people that are not on the receiving end of the amount of information that I'm on, given the content I talk about, may be surprised, but when they sit and rewind this and listen to it three times over, the eighth place trophy and the paying for your 25 year old, I think if they're honest and they're in their own quiet room right now and honest about it, they know how right I am about this. Isn't it strange how a generation will become a certain type of a parent? You know what I mean? Everybody kind of just, without even thinking about it, knowing about it, what's influencing us in the culture, everybody just started doing that kind of stuff. You know what's devastating, brother? It came from good intent. Right. A lot of us are doing all this shit because our parents, you know, I'm an eighties baby. Like, I didn't know my dad until I was 14, he was there every day, I just never talked to him. And my mom threw me outside at nine, I ran home at 12.30, eight lunch, threw me back outside and came home at six. They didn't know where to fuck me. I saw this comedian or somebody in social saying, we used to have a thing at 10 o'clock where the news was like, it's 10 p.m., do you know where kids are? That's how much our parents didn't know where the fuck we were doing. Now, this may make you laugh, I had lunch with a friend the other day, has a daughter, just went to BC, so she's 1980. Like, and I asked him, are you tracking her on the phone? He said, yeah, I could do no fucking bad that is. Yeah. We have 24 year olds walking around life knowing that their parents know where they are. Right. 24 years old. Yeah. Yeah. And the excuse is like, Gary, you don't get it. I just want to know my daughter's safe. I'm like, you don't get it. New York's been dangerous for a 500 years. 90, we've just succumbed to fear, brother. We are scared of everything. I know. It's fucking depressing enough. Mark Twain left home, I think at nine, and he never came back. He really just went out into the world and all the stuff he saw and all the dangers. There's 18 year old boys in fucking all over the world protecting our country right now. Yeah. Like, and we fucking have 24 year old guys in New York City being tracked by their mom, texting them, like, where are you at 1130? I've worked tomorrow. What the fuck are we doing? You're right. Can I ask you just a technical question on your DM thing? So you, I was thinking about this on the way here. You were at this weird spot of riding internet fame. You knew the tools, you knew what to do with the wine business and stuff like that, and you were there at the beginning of it. You were also, that means, at the beginning of people shitting on each other. All of the quagmire. That's right. You also have cultivated a philosophy being spit out at the other end of that of don't give a shit about what other people think. That's right. It's a lot of your mantra. That's a weird, that's a, what did you learn in that? Couple things. First of all, every good accolade you're gonna give me or anybody else's feeling towards me is 100% my mom's. Accolade, not mine. So I was built for this. When I say don't care about other people's opinions, I actually value other people's opinions quite a bit. But not on defining my self-worth. I want your information. In fact, what I do for a living is literally pay attention to what people think is good and bad, but I'm detached from the judgment both pro and con. Right. When I post something and in my comments, I get 50 goad emojis, I do not think I'm the greatest of all time. In the same token, by not being addicted to the positive comments, I'm not vulnerable to the negative ones. Right. Right? Now, couple things. You brought up something very important. Hey kids that are listening, 2007 and eight, 2006, seven and eight, Twitter was Nirvana. It was literally hippieville. Everything was great. We were gonna change the world. Everything is la la la. It was all rainbow and sun shines. Like it was a revolution. All the bad things in society, this is going to fix. And every 99% of interactions on Twitter in 2007 were incredibly positive, super on the offense. Like you could not actually, if you, you know, in fact, someone should AI all the information that was shared on Twitter in the year 2007, analyze it as pro, neutral or con, positive, optimistic versus negative. I do believe everybody would be on the ground stunned on how positive it was. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Why? Because the people that were on it in 2007 were people in Silicon Valley, people really trying to build for the future. It was based on optimism. It was the good version of capitalism, right? Like let's make impact. It was good. Yeah. Over time, everybody showed up. Everybody. So not the most progressive and the most on the offense and the most fuck the hate. Who gives a shit? Keep building, do good. Yeah. And that's okay. Like everybody goes through ebbs and flows. I'm not positive 24 seven. In fact, this Sunday when the Jets play the Steelers for those four hours, I'm gonna be very negative. I'm gonna be mad at everybody. I'm gonna hate every human in Pittsburgh. I'm gonna definitely hate Aaron Rodgers and DJ Watt. Like we all have versions of ourselves. What he was and what he became. But I will tell you that, yes, I was there when it was all optimism. Yes, I'm here right now where everyone by default thinks social media is bad. So they're deflecting responsibility. Like for example, back to this conversation. If you think TikTok is so poisonous for your 15 year old daughter, what the fuck are you yelling at me for? Who says TikTok's a good marketing tool? Right. You're a fucking parent. Delete it. Right. I literally, I bring this up a lot. I've literally had people come up to me at airports. Yeah. Be like, Gary, I love your shit, but I gotta be honest with you. You're pushing the social media stuff too much. I don't like it. I'm like, okay, Johnny, what don't you like them? Because I'm a funny character. I'll engage in that shit. I'm like, well, what don't you like? Well, my daughter's on it the whole time. Brain rot. I'm really concerned about it. Johnny, I talk about TikTok as a marketing tool to grow your business or your brand. I'm like, you're her father. If you think it's bad for her, delete it, dick face. Right. We have become finger pointers instead of thumb. So how do you think that got Johnny? He's seeing his daughter probably come out in a bad mood and feel shitty about herself or whatever from social media. Or he'll blame, I'll give you another one, I'm starting to interrupt. Or he'll blame TikTok for her dressing with no clothes. Meanwhile, every generation has had that. It was the Beatles' fault. It was Elvis' fault. It was Oswekely's fault. It was Britney Spears' fault. It was Madonna's fault. It was Christine Elligore. You know, if there's always something. It's just you. Yeah. But what have you learned personally of reading all these DMs and doing all the, in that arc of social media, what would you tell your kids? That parents aren't willing to have the tough conversations. And what is that tough conversation you have with your kids? What real self-esteem looks like. Like, do you actually wanna live a life where you're, hey kid, I'm aware that your entire universe right now is surrounded by these 13 kids in your class. What they think of you, how many likes you had. I, and by the way, I'm willing to have the combo that I know my kids are rolling their, 16 year olds around the world listen to me, except my kids. That's the rule. Right, I'm always looking for other people that have my shared values. I'm like, go look at that. You know this. Yeah, exactly. The reason you like showing your daughter my stuff is we agree. Right. But you know she's not gonna take it from you. So you're using me. My wife was literally just saying the same thing you were saying. And she was like, wow, she fought back, fought back. I showed her a clip of a stranger. Yep. She's like, oh, that makes sense. By the way, I live the same life. I'm not immune to father, kids dynamics. I'm aware that I'm not the proper messenger in certain instances. And I'm exactly the right messenger. Let me say something that I have a feeling the five of us in this room, all are gonna agree with and hopefully millions over the next decade that hear this whenever they hear this. There was a lot of things our parents said to us that at the time we were like, fuck you, mom. That's stuck. I just think the effort of the modern parents, here's what I think parents have done. They're like, this is not, Gary, you don't get it. I'm not the lead, ready? Let me tell you what parents did when I just did that little thing four minutes ago. Gary, fuck you. Like I can't delete the TikTok off my 15 year old daughters. She's gonna be ostracized socially in class. She's gonna lose her mind. I'm like, no shit, mom. The hard things are hard. Or do you not believe that TikTok is poisoning her and you do understand it's MTV and you just wanna fucking vent and blame shit? Do you know what I mean? Can we have a real conversation? Do you believe that TikTok is ruining your daughter's life because if you do believe that and you're not deleting it from her phone, you're a piece of shit? Or have you just succumbed to the blame culture we live in now and we just complain about shit 24 seven? Yeah. I remember Letterman had Michelle Obama on his program and he was talking about something about disciplining his kids and like, and she's like, well, you just tell them no. And he said, yeah, but then they cry and they fight back and it's a whole thing. And Michelle said, yeah, Dave, being a parent's hard. Yeah. And nobody hears that. Yeah, and that's right. And honestly, it's super. And by the way, I hope everybody hears this while I'm eating this bread. I apologize. It's just delicious. I'm not sitting on some weird ivory tower and it's easy for me to say, I'm definitely not looking down on or judging. I do many things against what I say publicly as a parent because you love these fuckers so much. I'm just telling you whether we like it or not, this is grounded in a lot of truth of results right now and we have to view it. Yeah, yeah. And when I like, I hate when everyone's like, oh, Gen Z's so entitled. No, no, no. It's in the air. I have unlimited 23 year olds that are working their face off in my company. And I know unlimited boomers that are lazy as fuck. I hate when we get into these warfares of like, Gen, Rations, or male versus female. All girls, yeah, all girls. All girls, all guys, all these guys, all finance bros. I know unlimited finance gentlemen who are wonderful kids that were raised wonderfully and are great dudes and you'd be lucky to even get a date with them, let alone marry them. But no, all finance bros are dick faces. We're just stuck right now. But what would I say? I would say to answer your question because I bounced around a lot. I tell my kids what I think they need to hear. And whether they roll their eyes, I don't give a fuck. No, because they'll carry it. Because they're gonna carry it. And I'm gonna deposit it over and over and over again. And I'm gonna say, you think this is your world, this is dog shit. You're not gonna remember 97% of these kids' names in 12 years. And what you need to ask yourself is who are you gonna be? And do you actually believe you're great? And I think you're great and I think you suck. You're great at some things, you suck at some things. Like it's not complicated. You're a human being and I talk to them about real shit. And I believe it's having a good impact. And will they have days where like, even though I'm trying to build up their self-esteem for them to be the ninja of the world, do I think they'll succumb to peer pressure at 17 at a party? Because my son likes some girl and she's drinking vodka and he's like, fuck it. Of course, it's called fucking life. But do I think he's gonna be a degenerate? No, I don't. No, because they do, they carry it. And then they get to a point, you think they're not listening to you, but then they're faced with a decision. And whether they listen to this voice or not, besides the point, they hear your voice. They know if I do this thing, this is too far for what my parents told me. That's right. And kids are smart. Like kids know if parents are full of shit. If you're a parent and you're telling your kids, don't worry about everybody thinks, but then you're yelling at your husband to get a better car because you wanna be fancy and everybody has a Lexus and you don't, how the fuck do you think they're gonna believe you? Right. Like kids know. Yeah. There's nothing less effective than a hypocritical parent. Yeah. Oh, I like that. Clip that. There's nothing. Never said that before. I like this one. But it's true. There's nothing less effective. Yeah. A hypocritical boss is annoying, but like and sucks and you quit or whatever, but a hypocritical parent really fucks a kid up. Yeah. And it fucks a parent up because the kid's not gonna respect you. No, you don't trust it. You don't trust the source. I mean my siblings talk about this all the time. I didn't even contemplate disrespecting my mom with the fear that she could feel that I was thinking it. Right. Yeah. That's the other thing I think we've really struggled with with the society. We've allowed, and this is politicians should be ashamed of themselves. We allow and parents should be ashamed. Every parent that lets their kid curse them out when they're 13 is lost their mind. Like I get that it's politically incorrect to slap your kid. I will smack the fuck out of a stranger's kid if I see them cursing out a parent. That is dumb shit. Do parents, please, if you're listening right now and this sparked the nerve, the fuck are you letting your 16 year old daughter look you in the face mom and say, you're fucking bitch fuck you mom and run away. You better run after her and grab her by the ponytail and beat her down. At least verbally punish her like steal her fucking phone. Do something. Brother we don't spank or slap. We don't even punish anymore. Do you know about this phenomenon? No. Well let me tell you. Parents don't punish. At all? Nope. No consequence. No consequence. Right. No wonder all these dick faces running around talking shit. Why couldn't we get parents like that? Because we had parents like that we decided to over correct. We're an aging empire. America is doing what the Roman Empire did. We've got it too good. In a world where you're buying $9 coffees and $40 Ubers and you're not worrying about your next meal, nobody gave a shit about the shit we care about now when it was the Great Depression. You were just worried to get some fucking bread. Why do you think I'm eating this bread? I come from immigrant humble like this is no bullshit. One of the biggest stories of my childhood was my parents telling me in Russia where I was born. They used to wait eight hours in line for bread. My dad's obsessed with bread. Like I'm eating this and really just thinking about my dad. I'm like, my dad would love this shit. And I think that's because he just couldn't get bread. We were on an 11 in the Soviet Union where I was born in 1975. We were on an 11 and a half year waiting list to get a phone. 11 years. So no wonder we're not over analyzing feelings. You don't have a fucking phone. It takes you eight hours to get bread. So we have it so good. We've gotten to this place. We've become crazy entitled. And there's an opportunity for everyone who's listening who doesn't have this. You have a huge advantage. Kids that are well-parented who have grit and patience who don't care about what other people think and are willing to put their head down. And what you and I grew up with, which was normal. If they do that now, they become extraordinary. Which is why I'm very motivated. You can lap them. I get very motivated and reinforced by the DMs I'm getting from kids that are winning when they stop crying and they start doing. And in two years, their whole world's different. And that's intoxicating for me when it's like, hey Gary, you changed my fucking life. Yeah, no kidding. You were the first person to tell me I was a bitch. But you didn't know. But I think when people listen, for all the people who are hearing me right now for the first time, I think humans are, I know humans are animals. We can sense. I'm not here to hurt people's feelings. I'm desperately trying to pull people out of this vortex that most of us are in. Yeah. And it takes effort. It is a beast. It is a big thing. I'm willing to have a lot of people listening right now, not like me, because of the way I'm delivering this in a Jersey style. Right. To pull out 13 people. There's people mad right now that I'm talking with my mouth full. Well, we don't like those people. We've established on this podcast. We're not allowed to do that. You're allowed to chew. Oh, we are. Oh yeah. No, I know. It's a big thing for people. But how can you have a breaking good podcast without chewing? I don't understand how people fixate on dumb shit. There's people who earlier on in this podcast were like, Bob, not gonna listen to Gary, he curses. Okay. But what are we talking about here? Let me ask you a business question. Please. What I do is comedian, me, writing books, writing standup, doing all of that stuff. You go and speak and you do a lot of public speaking. You have, we were saying earlier that we're kind of similar in that realm. The other side of your life is business, running businesses, running companies, doing all of that stuff. How have you balanced the two? And what do you see as the primary difference in them? Because one is you're selling you. Oh, it's very different. And then you're selling media companies. It's a great question. Media companies. So a couple things. So funny how my energy has gone like way down. Like when I talk about parenting kids, I'm just like, guys, we have to save these fuckers. I love them too much. Okay, let's break it down. The way I balance it is first, and this is important, this may help some people that are busy, especially working parents. The real answer to your question of how I balance it is by not over judging myself and giving myself grace. When you're doing 93 things like I am, you know, when you're juggling 13 things, I don't know if you know about this, but six fall to the ground and break. I don't cry about the six plates that broke. I'm happy that I have seven plates in a world where most people have one. Got it? So first, it's a relationship with myself. I'm so entrepreneurial, I have so much stuff going on. Stuff fails. I'm not dwelling on my failures. I wanna learn from them. I definitely don't wanna hurt other people. So like I'm always conscious of that. Investors, employees, that's very real to me. So first it's that. Second, I work. Like real talk, like how do you get a lot done? Like I have 11, 12 hour days, that's real life. That's not for a lot of people. And I don't think you have to work that hard. I just love what I do. It's just real life for me. It's the most fun that you have. Yeah, I always tell people this. I'm like, I'm telling you, you may not believe me, especially if you're not that kind of person. When people tell me to get a high from running, I'm like, you're full of shit. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like running is the worst, but it is not lost on me that there are many people that really get a tremendous joy from running. I have no idea what the fuck you guys are talking about. So when I say to people, I like working and running my companies more than golfing and sailing and laying on the beach, it's not lost on me that 90% of the audience right now is like, this guy is not telling the truth. But I know it to be true for me. Yeah, you enjoy. I really enjoy it. I'm very blessed. It's why I talk so much about doing what you love. It's nirvana. I would argue it's the ultimate human experience. So hours, judgment, and then self-awareness. I know what I'm good at. And then I hire for what I'm not good at. When did you realize that the Gary Vee part of it was something you were good at? Was it because you ran companies and you can deal with people? Actually, I'm gonna tell you a cool story, especially for the comedy crowd. The greatest compliment I was ever given went completely over my head. When you just said, when did you know? I knew after the fact I did something. Let me tell you the story. YouTube comes out. I was writeabout.com for context everyone. I launched an e-commerce site for my dad's liquor store in 1997 when that was like, what are you talking about? And exploded and built a huge company for my family. For my family, I had to start my own thing later. Immigrant family businesses, you all know who. If you know, you know everyone. So I was write about the website. Then I was really one of the first significant email marketers in 1997. I was write about that. Then a website called Google came out. I don't know if you heard about it. And they had this concept of Google ads where if you searched ads with pot up, I literally did that first. Day one, the day it launched, I bought all the wine terms, it crushed. I built this huge company. Then YouTube comes along and I'm like, man, this is interesting. Because I've been watching MySpace. I'm like, MySpace is doing something interesting. Which is why I was an early investor in Facebook, Twitter, all those things. YouTube comes out. I'm like, this is cool. A year earlier, I asked my developer who does the tech stuff. I'm like, can I make wine videos to review wine on our website? Because better than words would be me tasting and telling people. He came back, he's like, no, it costs too much to host the videos. If like 50 people watch this video, it costs like $4,000, we'll be out of business, no way. So when YouTube comes out, Eric Castor, I always want to give him flowers. Eric Castor came to me, he's like, hey, there's this new site YouTube. And I think you can do what you wanted a year ago, make wine videos. And we can just embed the video and we cost nothing. I'm like, nothing, that's a good price. $3.99 is always the right price. So I start this wine show, Wine Library TV, in February of 2006. I do a show every day. It's a 20 minute video. There's still up online if you want to go look at them. 20 minutes of me drinking wine, reviewing it. And I broke out because prior to that, all the wine critics, Robert Parker, the Wine Spectre, it was all stuffy shit. You guys know the wine world. And I'm out here comparing wine to like Hulk Hogan's jockstrap and like Big League Chew and like very Reverend. I was 30 years old. I'm who I am here, Jersey Boy. I don't have that in me. Even when I would go to- But you knew wine. But that's why I was dangerous. All the snobby sommeliers in New York that were pissed, they knew they had a problem, which I knew what the fuck I was talking about. So they could talk about my style, but not my substance. They were stuck. I get some traction and I make this video where I showed people how I built my palette when I was 17. Cause I wanted to be in the wine business since I was 17, but my parents wouldn't let me drink. So I would read these reviews and it'd be like Boys and Mary and Casice and all these words I'd never heard of. I was a Jersey Boy. I was like Apple, Orange, Strawberry. I was like, what the fuck is a gooseberry, right? Hero sandwiches. And then luckily for me, that Whole Foods started coming around in that time in Jersey. It wasn't just Shop, Right, and A&P anymore. And I would go there and they would have these weird fruits. So basically when I was 18, 19, 20, I would go to a Whole Foods or a Wegmans as they started to pop up in Jersey. And I would buy weird flavors of things, of the things I read in wine descriptions. Cause I was like, well, if I'm gonna have to sense what a gooseberry is in a Somnium Block from New Zealand, shouldn't I know what a fucking gooseberry tastes like? Anyway, I did this video on one episode where I tasted all these different things, including dirt. Like I actually ate dirt, which I think is normal, but everyone thought was crazy. Conan O'Brien's producer saw it and reached out to me and asked me to do the Conan show. First, I get this email and I think it's my friends cause this is the era where me and my friends were catfishing each other 24 seven, making them we were like former like pretty girls from high school and saying like, oh, I always liked you. Like it was a really, this is no joke, like a funny time where we were just catfishing 24 seven. So I'm like, this isn't real. I wait a couple of days, they reply back. I see a phone number, so I call, it's real. Brother, you don't love this. I've never done television in my life, no local, nothing. And my first TV appearance of my life is the Conan show. And you may know this, Conan doesn't rehearse. It's all improv. So I'm literally behind this curtain and they're like, go. I go do this wine skit where we taste four wines and the stuff, I smell his armpit, we eat dirt, we crush. It's the last segment. It's the, you know, the not famous person, the last spot. The comic spot. Conan's like, all right, everybody will see it tonight. So it ends, everybody claps to the new audience and he turns to me and you know, he's like seven foot fucking nine. So he looks down at me on like a midget in this video. And he's like, man, that was really good. I'm like, thank you. He goes, so where do you perform? And I go perform what? He goes, where do you do your skits? I'm like, I'm a wine store guy. He goes, get the fuck out of here. Your comedic time makes incredible. Amazing. So that's when you knew. That is when I knew a year and a half later once I realized how not only did I know Conan was awesome, but I didn't, at that point, even though I loved comedy, Richard Pryor was like what I listened to my car, Eddie Murphy, like I loved stand up, you know, like jerky boys, like I loved it. We were just doing jerky boys before you got here. I loved that, is that right? I was like, my glasses. Yes, I, Andrew Dice Clay, I lived through all that. HBO, when HBO was what Netflix is now, like I lived through that. Yes, Sam, like that stuff was, I loved it. But I didn't understand how respected and revered Conan was. And I didn't understand how profound that compliment was. So three years later, I kind of woke up to it. I was like, wow, I just got lucky in the DNA game of my cadence and my timing. Right, and jersey. And jersey, like yeah, I mean, I think this goes back to what we talked about earlier. You know, when you and I were growing up, your best friends made fun of you 24 seven. Constant. Constant. Constant. Like my way of showing love is making fun of people. I literally was thinking on the way here, because you talk about not giving a shit about what people think about you. And I thought of the line, what is, what's the difference between not giving a shit about what people think about you and being an asshole? And I was like, I could say that to Gary because I know where he came from. And he won't, he'll know that I'm not calling him an asshole. Correct, and by the way, I have an answer for it. It's called intent. Yeah. When I come and do this and take time out of my day, I'm doing it for a couple of reasons. One, I respect you. Thank you. I mean it. I like what you do. Two, I'm aware there's a lot of people in this audience that may not know me because like, you know, everyone has different audiences. Yeah. What am I doing here? Am I here to like pedal a book or a movie? This is not normal stuff, like the way we grew up. Yeah. And go and do the, I'm here because if three people, three brother, if three people who had never heard of me, if I was the right style of love, which is Jersey love, that got them to say, you know what? He's fucking right. And do something about it? Well, this was a good use of an hour. Does that math work? Yes. For someone who's been through a lot of marketing and DMs and stuff. It does. If you walk away with three, that's enough. You'll love this. Listen to what I said. I'm not looking to get three fans. Right. To move three. To move three. Right. I'm gonna walk away with hundreds of fans. Right. Because I'm good. Right? I'm gonna get hundreds out of this. Yeah. I'll also get 25 and like, fuck that dude, it was too much and I get that. I'm not confused by what my energy is. But it's not about how many I get. It's not by how many I lose. I know that for some reason, the way I communicate, what I talk about, what I observe, I have 15 years of track record now to know, I'm gonna change, move, adjust three people. Right. And is it worth it? Of course, one person. And has that changed through the years? No. Because before like you're building companies, you're doing this stuff to, is there, now that you've been successful, is there move people? I was successful because move people was the real game I've always was playing. Really? Yeah. Really, real talk. Starting to whine. Yeah, like, look, think about my life. I built a huge company for my dad. I left with nothing. I started my next company in a conference room because I had no money. Because I spent, I literally worked 100 hours a week in a liquor store for a decade, just to build a business for my dad. It was immigrant shit. Yeah. And by the way, did I leave with some resentment? Of course, I'm a grown man. Like I was 32, I was like, fuck, I have nothing. Right. I started a new company. You literally just to be clear for, Yeah. For our listeners, you built that, you took a liquor store and built this into a $60 million a year business. That's right. And then you- Not $60 million valuation, revenue. Right. And then you- It wasn't my business. It was for your parents and you left with your back to zero. It's zero. Yeah. Like when I started VaynerMedia, $400 million a year business, we started it out of Buddy Media's conference room in Columbus Circle, cause I couldn't afford rent, even though I just built this huge business. Right. I didn't build Wine Library for my money and my bank role. I built it as the great thank you to having the best parents in the world. Right. That's how I thought about it. Right. Now at the tail end, why I left was I was starting to build resentment towards my father. That's real talk. Right. Like I didn't want to feel that way, but now it was getting older. I was about to start my own family. I went to the bank cause I wanted an apartment for me and my wife at the time. And they were like, you can't get an apartment. You're worthless. But I'm like, yeah, but I built Wine Library and they're like, that's cute. That's your dad's. And it kind of was like the first time that I had to wake up and be like, because I was, I was, I would use the word obsessed. I was obsessed with building something big. Yeah. Yeah. For them. Cause I, to this day at 49 years old, it is the thing I'm most grateful for. Like my mom did it, bro. Like she did it. Yeah. Like, again, I think I'll tell you what, back to what I just said earlier, one of the other reasons I'm here for this hour is out of guilt. 99% of the people listening to this podcast did not have the mother I had. Out of gratitude, 99% of the people did not have it. And I feel like I'm just a messenger of what she did well. My mom lost her mom at five. Wow. I think about her all the time. I'm like, out of this woman, become the greatest mom of all time without even having an example. That's insane. You know? We do a thing on this program called an uncomfortable moment. Yeah. Where we take a look at some stuff that maybe makes our guests a little uncomfortable, but maybe not. Let's do it. As a fellow Jersey kid, we took a look at what your life would have been if you had different parents. And you were just a lazy Gary. This was Gary TV. Gary TV, bro. Listen, honestly, I look at that. And you just showed me a picture of why I'm so grateful for my parents. First of all, did you guys like Photoshop my arms? They look very thin there. I'm a little bit concerned about that. This was before you started working out more. Fair enough. That might be true. Number two, yeah, man. Listen, I'm very grateful that I was born with little, grew up with little. I learned, you know, I always say this thing, brother, it's hard to be hungry when you're fed. I'm empathetic to kids that have their parents do everything for them. It's hard to be, like how on earth, you know? Like, do I have, listen, and you can't over correct the other way. I mean, I was literal child labor. I started working my dad's store at 14. Yeah. Like do I think my dad, my mom and dad, if they were sitting here, would say we love our son. He's the best. Thank God he talks about us this way. But if we could do it again, we wouldn't have paid him more than 10 hours a day when he was 14. You know, but at the time, we were so, you're immigrant life. Yeah. You're fucking just trying to get by. Exactly. You're not thinking about- Like my first car, I bought at a garage sale for 550 bucks. This is like not like, you know? Yeah, yeah. No, there's, that thing of that we overanalyze and in every aspect, adults, kids, all of it, and it's a luxury to be able to sit back and be like, how am I feeling? Yeah, it is a luxury. I like today. Instead of just hustling and getting up and having to do something. And I will say this, it's purple. It's not red or blue. I think I said it earlier and I hope everyone heard it. I like that we're talking about these things. There's a lot of people. When you and I were kids, everybody who was an alcoholic father, it wasn't talked about. Right. You know, there was- There was just dads. Fathers in our neighborhood would like slap their wives. That wasn't good. There's many things that are better now. Yeah. You know, like macho men wouldn't talk about feelings and that led to suicide. You know why suicide is also up? We now call it suicide. Before it was like, oh, dad slipped in the kitchen and died. Like we hid things. The world is, the reason we know about stuff now is like people did all these things before. They weren't reported. He had a heart attack. No, he didn't. He hung himself in the, like, I grew up in this environment. That's not what happened. We didn't report it the same way. And why did that happen? Because that macho guy couldn't talk about his feelings. He held it in so much and he cracked. So I don't think like, it's not one or the other. But using political terms, we need to become purple as humans. Yeah. Right. This all blue and all red thing is fucked up. And they're both out of their goddamn minds. Completely out of their minds. Yeah. No, it doesn't work. Completely out of their minds. And like, I don't think hate or canceling or judgment or looking down on people is gonna motivate people. This is about the opportunity. And let me say it nice and slow. If you have the luxury of even hearing us talk right now. That means you are listening to a podcast on an $800 phone. Right. You have a literally, I'm on the board of, I have a very big event here in a couple of weeks in New York. I'm on the board of an organization called Penses of Promise. We build schools in third world countries where if you do not build a school, the way the kids in the neighborhood get educated is some 80 year old has one book and reads it over and over. Right. I'm on another board called Charity Water. 800 million people do not have access to clean water. It means that within an eight hour window, they cannot get to clean water. Eight. 800 million. 100 million people on earth. That is 10% of our society. Jeez. I don't know what to say to everybody who's listening other than you have life by the balls. You are lucky. You don't think so because CNN, Fox, your parents, your neighbors and everybody else has told you everything sucks. The truth is everything does not suck. You've decided to succumb to it. And there's humans like me and there's plenty of other people on social, not on mainstream media. Mainstream media is a cesspool of garbage. And I'm talking both sides. All they do, go turn on TV right now. All they do is scare people. Scare, scare, scare, scare, scare. Literally the amount, because I love reading culture, I go back and forth on Fox and CNN all the time. It is literally the same exact thing from a different angle, but both are doing the same thing, which is I'm gonna scare the fuck out of you. Right, so you come back after the commercial. Right? I just think that everybody's listening needs to start listening to more positive, practical people. Right, like us. Like us? I mean it, man. It's why I'm here. I believe that, it's why I like comedy. Comedy's a son of a bitch. I've always loved you fuckers, because you guys have been able to use the facade of stand up to actually get to real shit. When you think about what Carlin and Pryor were saying, when they were saying it, based on what was going on, they were doing God's work in a lot of ways. I mean that. No, I know. They were talking about real shit and that's what's happening now. Now the problem is this new crop, I think we're getting sucked up a little bit too much in the red and blue. Oh, big time. So I think, the comedy actually has camps now of like, yeah, they're politically aligned. Correct, and I think when you look at the OG comics, they were purple. Oh, Carlin would throw up. They're either side. Correct, correct. They would be purple. Right, like when red went to red, they shit on them. When blue went to blue, they shit on them. Right now we're like, we have to pick sides. And it's fucked up, I have no interest, I'm purple all the way, fuck everyone. I wanna win. How do you digest, do you digest news or are you just too busy running around? No, bro, look at this, look at this on my phone. Look at this app right here. So this is an app called Break the News. Break the web, excuse me. Break the web. It's AI and what it's doing is it takes all the information of everything. And it gives me the headlines that are going on in the world right now. I'm constantly trying to pay attention. I wanna know everything. But not because I think my two fucking sense matter and I wanna go pontificate. I wanna figure out what the fuck all you 8 billion fuckers are thinking about and why. Right, right. You understand? Yeah, come here. I'm not here to add my two sense and think I know anything. In fact, I actually think the most audacious thing on earth is to think another human being should see the world exactly like you. Oh God, yeah. I would never, the reason I don't go too political is I don't have the audacity in me to think someone who grew up with, for example, a cursing that I've been doing. If you grew up in a Southern home where your grandma was your idol and her number one demonization is, boy, you don't curse. And now you're listening and it's sharring? Yeah. How could I possibly judge you? Right. But please don't judge me where I grew up in Jersey in the 80s and this is like our love language. Right, exactly. Yeah. So, you know, I just don't have the audacity to think that someone should see the world the way I see it. Yeah. That doesn't mean there isn't right and wrong. No. I think we should all agree that murder is bad. And also that you're all working towards the same thing which is to be safe and happy and take care of your family. But how people define it is different. Yeah. But I mean, that's the one thing that's really the most upsetting in the culture right now is it's okay to have different views. And even if you're sucked into Fox or sucked into CNN and you see this world through the fearful lens that they're showing you, there still should be a thing that we need everyone on the block to be okay or our block is shit. Well, I'll tell you, that part of the- There's a couple of things that happened. I think wisdom has been, I think vanity has emerged and wisdom has declined. Like for example, I was a 49 year old man, like I wear a ball cap and like T-shirts and we all wanna look young. Like we have put youth culture on a pedestal. The kids that know tech, young, everybody wants to look good. You got 68 year olds out there looking all thotty and hot and shit. I'm like, this is crazy. Like, you know what I mean? Like literally like right? Like literally 68. I'm like, they should not be this sexy. Like this is weird. Like you know what I mean? And what I will tell you breaks my heart. Actually, here's a public service announcement that I hope triggers someone to do something about it. Do you know what kills me? I'm sad that we lost our way with the following. So I travel a lot. When I'm in an airport and I watch a fucking 74 year old woman carrying two bags walking and there's nine 28 year old dudes sitting on the seat on their phone playing a game. And they don't have the courtesy and civility to stand up and give that woman a chair. Yeah. I'm broken with that brother. I know. And I would say that we've lost that. That's where like, that's where church, that's where good parenting, good cops and firemen. Like we've lost a little bit at hometown thing. And I think it's, I think we can get it back but I think we have to acknowledge that we all have to step up. Well, it's a, what you're describing is vanity which is thinking about yourself and not thinking about the other. That's right. You have to think about the other. And people don't realize if you think about the other and act for the other, you actually selfishly become better. Also, we have politicians on both sides of the aisle who literally act like fucking seventh grade boys. Right. Like we are very far away from JFK back to this point standing on a pedestal and saying, don't ask what the country will do for you. What are you doing for the country? We've lost our collectiveness to your point. And more importantly, like we're embarrassing out there. Yeah. Like when I tell you, I so look down on 90% of public servants because they don't know how to act civil. Yeah. Like basic manners and it trickles. Yeah. No, it's an example. They're like, oh, negativity is up. The people that run the world are fucking douchebags. Across the board. I'm saying this as a by part. I mean this as if one side is better than the other. As if. Yeah. And come on.
