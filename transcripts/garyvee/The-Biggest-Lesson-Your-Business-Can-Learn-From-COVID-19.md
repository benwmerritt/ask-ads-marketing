trying to get innovative and keep it fresh and interesting. So there's some range of different things we find ourselves doing now that we didn't perform. You got your perspective. I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? I'm tired to cap. What's been the biggest challenge and what's been the biggest opportunity in running something through the beginning of this year? Q1, which is always crazy for you because Super Bowl, you had a crazy successful Super Bowl halftime show this year and then you're just probably gearing up for summer, which I'm sure for soda. Let's call it what it is, big time territory and then boom, this happened. So break that down for me. Yeah, I think it's crazy. When you think of it 2020, from a Pepsi point of view, we actually started the year really strong. We had just launched our new advertising campaign, That's What I Like, which is our first new tagline in 20 years. We had a huge Super Bowl, as you said, big focus on Pepsi Zero Sugar with our spot, the halftime show with J.Lo and Shakira was the most talked about. We look at this thing called Share a Voice. We had, I think, 43% of all the brand conversations on social. We're about Pepsi during the Super Bowl. So we're killing it to start the year and then all of a sudden COVID happens and you're just like, oh my god. And I think when you look at just the seismic shift that it takes in culture and just the world, the rules change in business and how it all works. And so the first and foremost thing we did is we wanted to focus on our people. I think like a lot of organizations, we have these frontline employees who are driving, making, moving and selling our product on a daily basis, keeping grocery stores stocked, all of that, making sure that they're safe and protected. And so we spent a lot of time protecting the safety of our 90,000 employees on our frontline, as well as from a corporate standpoint, really doing a lot to provide protective gear, screening services, PepsiCo foundation, meals, all that kind of stuff. But the real opportunity, as you talk about it, is as a brand standpoint, we have an onus as a brand that's connected to culture and music and providing enjoyment and entertainment for folks on how we can connect with people in an authentic way, which is really how we started during that transition period. After everyone got through the shell shock of, oh my gosh, this COVID thing is happening, like what the heck is happening, really trying to figure out how we could create a shared moment of unity, given people are feeling isolated, how we could raise awareness and do some good for COVID 19 relief, but also create this moment of fun and enjoyment, which is really what brought us to this idea of partnering with a global citizen who they're a great organization. We created this thing with them called One World Together at Home, which was this really great thing with them, Lady Gaga, the World Health Organization. We brought together artists from all over the world to really have the first of its kind on all three networks, big kind of concert relief fun thing. And we had to, agilely, redirect, I redirected my entire brand, seemed to work on this other marketing resources, worked with you guys and banner people. I was getting texts at 1.30 in the morning, I'm like, we gotta move. It was bad shit crazy. But we designed the logo for the thing, we helped with artist outreach, built a ton of marketing materials, shipped that are media schedule against it all in a matter of weeks to just create, you know. Todd, on that note, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to get a lot of you before we bounce out. Another thing that we haven't touched on today, working from home. Have you been surprised, disappointed? What's been your observation on what you thought you could do with you and your team and your agency partners and others? And versus the reality, who did Todd cop? What did Todd Copeland, the man think going in and what is now believe? Yeah, it's interesting because working from home, like we've always been a, you know, it's somewhat flexible work environment at PepsiCo and people, you know, you have to snow day, you work from home, you're working from the city. A lot of my team is based in New York City and so they don't want to drive up to Western. So they'll work from the city for day. So we've had, we've had zoom, we've been on zoom for a while. But what was interesting is like people back when it was there, you know, no one would put their screen on. They'd always have the little sticky note covering their camera, you know, and they just be on, they treat it like a conference call. I think now, because of necessity, everyone's really leaning in and using all the tech as it's intended. And it's actually working quite well and quite seamlessly and, you know, and it's really nice. And I think Todd, I literally never want to be on a conference call ever again. I'm being like, one of the reasons I was skeptical and concerned is I'm a very touchy feely. I like it in the room, you know, I remember the last meeting I was with you, I'm like drawing on my desk, you know, like, I like that stuff yet, yet this is working big time for me. I feel the humanity through it. I just do. And, and what for sure, I can tell you right now, I am absolutely not going on a phone conference call because those kids, they've never been good for me. Well, I'll tell you, even aside from the, the efficiency aspect of zoom and all this stuff, I will tell you from a cultural standpoint, our team has never felt closer, more tight, more tight. Background of their house. The authenticity, it's what's so fascinating is we have such a range of people, we have people on our team who are straight out of college in a studio in Manhattan by themselves. And you have somebody living in the suburbs with a dog crawling on them, a spouse on a conference call and kids asking for questions on their homework. And you're, they're all on this together. And it really just makes people human and real and brings us authentic connectivity that we're all, you know, I'm going to say we're all in this together. But no, it is one of those things where we really, you feel that connection, which as a team, you really need, and you can empathize with people to actually get more agile and quicker and faster around a lot of things you're doing.
