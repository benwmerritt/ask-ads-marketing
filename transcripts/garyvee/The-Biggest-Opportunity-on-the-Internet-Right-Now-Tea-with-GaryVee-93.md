I believe that the best way to make money on the internet right now is live social shopping. What not in Tik Tok Shop? Twitch now has it, Tok Shop Live. There's all sorts of places you can go. If you have more than 10,000 followers on social media and like to sell stuff, live social shopping is the biggest opportunity in the world right now. I was with a guy yesterday who's one of the biggest wholesalers to flippers. All the people that pay him to be in his mastermind, he said like 80% of them started because of my 2017 Flip Challenge. That's how impactful that was. And that was eBay. Now we have live shopping. Easier. I have been practicing as a psychotherapist in India. I have been creating content for seven to eight years and my Instagram blew up in 2022. Yeah. And I've got like 22,000 followers there and occasionally some videos blow up to like 500K, 1 million or something. But recently the reach has been very low and I've got a few clients. How do I approach content to build my business and presence on social media as a psychologist in India? You've got to get better. Meaning, you know, something's going on right now with my team, we've gotten better in the last three months. Like we just, and that really started with me because where my energy was, it always starts with you back to accountability. And then it goes on to Sid, his accountability and then it trickles down. We're better right now. We're trying harder. Like I don't know what else to say. We're not quote unquote mailing it in. I think a lot of people that have your situation win and then just get into old behaviors and they're doing the same shit. V, you have to try new shit. You've got to try different angles. You got to try different styles. You got to do, you got to write out your thoughts on mentality and mental health in the notes pad and then post that with a video following it up. And now you did a two post carousel that started with, you know, iPhone notes and then your video. You've got to read garyv.com slash attention, the deck. And you got to like really learn the details. You know, my answer to you and everybody who's watching is you've got to get better at the craft. The algorithm is not hurting everyone. It's hurting everyone who's not good. Do you understand? The reach is down not because something happened to Instagram and India, the reach is down because you're not as good right now as you were in 2020. That's all and you know it. And then when that works, it will work, you will get more clients just like you did before. Because if you're a 22,000 followers and occasionally get 500,000 views, when you start getting one every week that gets a million views and you get to 100,000, you'll get more clients. You've already seen that the attention gets you clients, right? And so you've got to think about PAC, platforms, algorithms and culture. Platforms are, you know, you're lucky, you're in India. There's like a billion platforms, right? All the different dialects and languages, all the, you know, TikToks banned. So there's all the TikTok clones. You got YouTube shorts, you got LinkedIn. You need to be on more platforms. Then there's algorithms. That's understanding how the algorithm works. I already just explained that to you. Go read GaryVee.com slash attention. Adrian, please pin that for everyone. Everybody who's on Instagram and other places, I am on whatnot. It's GaryVee.com slash whatnot. And then finally culture brother. You know what's going on in India. Or maybe you don't, but you need to know what's going on with what people are thinking about, right? Like, are they worried about the economy? Are they excited about a new band on TV? Is there something happening? Like, is there a restaurant chain that's crushing? Like, I don't know. Like, it's really that simple. Like, you have to know what's going on in popular culture. Right? So platforms, algorithms and culture is how you get great at social content. Social content posting is free. Awareness comes from that free posting when it's done well. Awareness leads to relevance. Relevance is how you get awareness. Relevance is the first way that people consider buying something from you. Oh, I like Courtney. I like what she says. That's relevance to me. Oh, now I'm considering things that come out of Courtney's mouth that she recommends I might want to buy. Relevance, consideration, purchase. That is a framework that is true. Please understand it if you don't chat APT it. What did GaryVee mean when he said relevance, consideration, purchase. And fucking cook, B. You have to be better, Vee. You just have to be better. I'm a seven year old woman. You're a seven year old woman. Okay, keep going. And Eager's like AI, which I'm doing. But I don't have particular skills to go on YouTube and post some videos, et cetera. I do want to make some money from- Live social shopping. I believe that the best way to make money on the internet right now is live social shopping. What not in TikTok shop? Twitch now has it. There's something called district. You can check out. Talk shop live. There's all sorts of places you can go. I believe live social shopping is the number one way that people can make. Who here has more than 10,000 followers on social media and has made no money on what not? Please put up that in the chat. Say 10K, say 10K. Say 10K in the chat if you're that person. All right, all these people, you see this, Aaron? All these people that say 10K, I believe that if they were good enough to get 10,000 followers on social, that if they're also comfortable selling, actually here, let's go with that. Everybody, if you're in the 10K crew, who's in the 10K crew and also comfortable selling something? Because some of you are not. A lot of people hate selling. Rips, you like selling? Sid? Court? So-so? Aaron? No, right? Everyone's different. And that's great because, you know, Aaron's remarkable at production for YouTube, massive skill. But for the people that are at 10K and like to sell stuff, live social shopping is the biggest opportunity in the world right now. I was with a guy yesterday who's one of the biggest wholesalers to flippers for 15 minutes. He wanted to say hello. He's built a huge community of people that flip. If you sell like 14 items a day, I think he said something really cool. Like if you sell 14 items a day, like on eBay for a year, you make 150K. Like it was, I don't remember, I don't wanna, but he said all the people that pay him to be in his mastermind, he said like 80% of them started because of my 2017 flip challenge. That's how impactful that was. Every, and that was eBay. Now we have live shopping. Easier, easier. Now it's and, you wanna be on eBay and these live shopping platforms, but I could not, I could not, could not push you all harder, harder to learn about live social shopping. And I love the 70 year old. You know what I like about a good 70 year old and a retiree? They can get into that antique thrift store, flea market, garage sale life. We can get very lucrative. This guy, Tech, who I was talking to yesterday, that talked about a guy in his group that in North Carolina this weekend bought a box for $5. That had original inaugural season Chicago Bulls, original jerseys and warmup gear, sent it to Heritage, one of them's $30,000 with a bid on it already. The thrill of the hunt, that you can get into wholesale dollar stores, start buying from China and India. And now with the tariffs, you've got Indonesia and Vietnam and all these new places that popped up that can do supply chain, you know, not to China's level, but become alternatives. Like there's so much opportunity. Please everybody, learn what live social shopping is. I'm 30 years old and have less than $100 in my account. I wanna start creating content, but I'm lost. I started working with someone where I vlog their daily life experiences. Do you think this is a niche to start from? And how do you think I can start putting myself out there because I have no social media presence? Your money means nothing. Like whether you have $100 in your bank account or a billion, that meant nothing to the question. Posting on social and starting is completely based on self-esteem and insecurity. Almost every single person watching this right now was not posting because they're insecure. Period and a story. Well, I don't have anything to add. Well, I'm not that smart. Well, I don't look that good. Well, I don't this, I don't that, I don't this. I don't want my neighbors to say something. I don't, well, Gary, it's my social, my friends are on this. I don't want them to judge me because I'm a cool girl, but what I would post about is Legos. None of my friends know that I'm into Legos. If I'm listening to you write with the niches and this and that, Legos. Like it's all the same shit. You know, like, so do I think it's a good niche to film someone if that someone is me, worked out for fucking DRock and Caleb and Babin? But if you fucking followed DRock, Caleb or Babin, it probably would have not worked out. Or maybe it would have. I don't know. So that's that. Insecurity, you're insecure. 100 bucks means nothing to me. And is it a good idea to document someone and follow them around? Yeah, they're good. You know? Jake. Hey, what's going on? Can you hear me? I can't, my brother. More importantly, can they hear you? Can you guys still hear them on what not? There we go. Finally. Day two. All right, Jake, talk to me. So my cousin and I started a small side hustle about a year and a half ago in the children's edutainment system. I mean, we teach kids about dinosaurs and fossils and paleontology and we use animatronic costumes and puppets to get that across. We have a large 12 foot long, eight foot tall walking T-Rex. We call him Terry the T-Rex. We bring him to schools, libraries, daycares, et cetera. So we're currently doing on the slide. A lot of hustle on the weekends. My wife's a teacher. She helps me on the weekends. I work in New York City. We're out of Cranford, New Jersey. So my cousin, he works schedule four days on, four days off and we're constantly battling. Can't, what are some indicators we should look at where at least one of us takes the plunge and goes full time versus still trying to do this on the side? How much money is it making? First year, we did about 80 grand and then this year, Ron Pace, to potentially double that. We're getting there. And how much profit on that 150 will you do? 70%. And what's- 10%, we're turning a lot of it back in. We got another costume coming from overseas. I got it. We're going to make it. I got it. And who's making the least amount of money or is the most miserable of the three of you? It's probably a toss up. I would probably say my cousin, but he has three kids, I have no kids. It's probably like I could take more of the risk, I guess, going full time, but I don't know, it's a toss up. I think one of us needs to be all in and I have the fear factor of leaving my full time job and trying this. What's your full time job? I work in city marketing comms in the city. What's that, an agency? No, it's for a fintech company. But you do marketing? Yeah, marketing comms. I'm like on the internal comms team. Like old bullshit, like comms life, like PR press releases and like getting up meaty. Some of that, yeah. How much do you make? About 130, 140 bonus. Yeah, I mean, I think you should quit. And if it doesn't work out, you should email me and I won't give you 130 because it sounds like you're doing old bullshit, but I'll give you like 95 and teach you. That sounds great to me. I mean, I love playing with the kids with the dinosaurs teaching them. I mean, it's so much more fulfilling, I feel like. You're making 170K in top line revenue on a business where no one's being able to really go in on it. Like if you went full time, like it sounds like you're putting in the least, right? Of time or like not that much because you're nine to fiveing, right? Yeah, I mean, yeah, we're probably putting in, I mean, mostly weekends, a couple of things during the week that my cousin will do because of his work schedule, he's off, but yeah. If we were able to go five days a week, I mean, just the summer alone, we could go three jobs a day. Five days a week, just the summer, three hours and all that stuff. Just, just. Yeah, I just think that you need to quit, bro. Because the numbers look good to me. Like 170, could you imagine if you put 70 hours in? Yeah, I do think about that a lot. Well, what the fuck are you thinking about? I think about a lot of shit too, but you need to do shit, bro. Yeah. You got a backdrop now that like, you got a backup plan, you're gonna go hard for a year and if you fucking suck, you're gonna work in VaynerMedia. All right. That sounds great to me. I mean, listen, it's something I've been thinking about a lot, so. I don't give a fuck. Gives a shit if you've been thinking about it a lot. Just do it. Yes, that's like, oh, I've been thinking about working out for three years. That's nice. But you're chunky. Like, you know, like, not you, Jake. I mean, I'm just saying this as an overhaul. Like, you thinking about it means nothing. I've literally given you a full parachute other than you'd have to live a little bit more conservatively for a little while and prove that you could do something modern here at Vayner because it's a big leagues. It sounds like you're a T-ball in marketing, but you know, you should probably quit right now. Do you have any savings? Yeah, yeah, I got savings. Yeah, yeah. And Jake, like, you're pissing everyone off right now. You know that, right? Like the amount of people that are pissed in the chat right now, and by the way, they shouldn't be pissed because you fucking earned it. I'm proud of you. Yeah, so it's a lot of work. I mean, like I said, my wife's a teacher. Like, we're hustling on the weekends. I mean, we're... I'm gonna say it again. Did you hear the words? Fucking proud of you. They shouldn't be, they're pissed. But like, but I don't think they should be pissed at you. Like, I'm proud of you. But I think you should jump 170, 150, excuse me, top line revenue with you not spending any real Monday through Friday time on it. Yeah. Are you fucking kidding me? You're gonna crush. Plus you should get out of the job you're in anyway because the marketing you're doing is gonna fall behind and you're gonna get fired. And you're gonna get fired anyway. Yeah, it's not, it's not stability at all. Yeah. Exactly. Everyone's like, I don't wanna leave my stability. I'm like, that's not stability. Doing fucking press releases and hitting up media in 2026 in an AI marketing world. You're fucking a young kid doing old shit. You're basically in your career walking around with a cane. Hey kids. You're not doing marketing, bro. Yeah. You know that, right? Yeah, no, I know. It's, I know. The reason you like your job is it's easy and stupid. Right? Yeah, yeah. It's easy. Yeah, it's not, it's not crazy difficult, no. Right, so it sounds like you're completely mailing it in, Jake. Sounds like you're choosing to go to a nine to five that does nothing like work. That you're not growing, you're decaying and you're choosing the easy path. You have savings, you have, you say you're hustling, but the reason you're able to side hustle is your job's a fucking joke. You're looking at, you're like adjusting your fantasy football team at like one to three PM on a Wednesday, right Jake? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so what the fuck are we talking about here? I'm fucking adjusting my fantasy team from one to three PM on a Wednesday, dude? No, do you have a fantasy team? No, it's not. And not because I'm so busy, but because I can't play fantasy football because the Jets are my love and I'm not gonna fucking adjust my love for fantasy football. My fucking son has drank may on his fucking team and it's pissing me off. Jake? Yeah, this is helpful. Do you now understand what's happening in your life? Yeah, I get it, I get it. I can jerk off Monday through Friday instead of going living your dream. You've chosen easy. Yeah. The reason you don't wanna leave your job is you know it's a joke. Are you ready? Well, you're way better off to go take this jump. If it fails, you learn that you're not entrepreneur and you come to work at Vayner, you make less money, but you'll learn. I'll be paying you to teach you. All right. All right. Jake the snake, don't forget it. Jump, Jake, jump is your new name. Well, we'll come in, we'll do your next take your kids to work at the headquarters. You're no longer Jake the snake, you're jump, Jake, jump. All right, jump, Jake, I like that. Jake, if you don't quit next week, we're not friends. All right, thanks, Gary, I appreciate it. I'm just laughing at the back of your cousin. That's my brother, my brother's... What just happened? What happened, what happened? I think it was his brother. And they deleted, I think somebody, that bot, I think it was his boss that he killed him. I think Jake's dead, guys. Fuck. All right. Poor Jake. Went young. All right, let's keep it going. I'm 44 years old and after 10 years, I was let go from my job. I'm fully ready for whatever is next. In my next steps, what should I do first? 44 let go of a job, what should I do next? I mean, I don't know, like, there's a little more to that question that I need. You know, obviously you want to get another job. My biggest belief is that an enormous amount of people are going to be surprised and let go over the next 18 months because of not only AI, but just in general, you know, companies, you know, trying to be more efficient. Just the reality of the business world, it's getting more competitive. The biggest companies are getting bigger. You know, every day that Amazon gets bigger is another day that a retail store with 11 stores gets smaller, right? So we're going through this time of change and the AI thing is a really big deal. And I think the best way to get a job, if that's what that person wants at 44. And again, so many of you have heard this over and over for me, but I have no idea why people continue to lag on this. We must put out LinkedIn content around what you know, what you like, what you care about. That's just like it. Like, you know, you must share your information, your knowledge, your understanding of your craft in these environments. That's the issue, right? Like, I don't think people understand that fucking LinkedIn's your answer. I do not understand that, you know, like, what are you gonna, you know, like, you're not gonna send resumes. We have to put out content of LinkedIn around your expertise, around coding, around management, around, you know, being an electrician. What the fuck it is? Like, we need content on LinkedIn. That is how people will get jobs. You must put out content on LinkedIn to get jobs. Jobs are gonna be more competitive than ever and your basic resume is not gonna cut it. And so that's that, you know? Symposite, all right, let's move on. All right, next question is from Tara. I started with Charlize Bari, a kid's book brand that teaches about endangered animals and helps parents connect with their wild little ones. We've got one book out and two almost ready to launch. It's so early, we're learning as we go and making some costly mistakes. But how do you know when to keep something as a passion project versus when to double down and make it a full-on business? After two years, we have not made a profit yet. So it's the toughest question. Like, the amount of people that quit three weeks before their shit that they spent four years on pops off is, it's a real number. It's happened quite a bit in the world. And then the amount of people that are like, oh, one more year, one more year, one more year, and have spent another three years, quote unquote, wasting their time, that's also real. It's a really hard question for me to answer on this show. But what I will tell you is you have to balance your regret with your tolerance for financial anxiety, right? You know, that is the framework, you know? And I think that too many people are delusional and think they're rappers and like, you know, try to be a rapper for 20 years and it's not there. Like, you have to look for signals. You need to make some level of progress, but it's also okay to go backwards. So this is a very tough question to answer generally. I always err towards the place of putting out more social media content to drive sales. Like, are you good at the marketing? Like, businesses need marketing. Marketing is the offense of business. And the reason I spent so much time talking about marketing is because it is the savior to so many people out here. My last question was marketing. Like, you're gonna lose your job. I want you to get another job. I think you're more likely to get a job if you put out good information and videos showing your knowledge and skills on LinkedIn than spamming people on LinkedIn and Message Form or sending in a resume. In this scenario, selling those books, if they, can we pin GaryVee.com slash attention? If you have not, team, if you have not read this 40 page plus deck and implemented it, and so many of you of the people on this show have, and everybody on Instagram, please come over to GaryVee.com slash whatnot. I just, I really need people to push themselves on this because this fixes the issue here because the sales are not gonna come miraculously to this book and then they are gonna quit. So I focus on offense. I'm at a nine to five job at a bank and I've been more stressed out than ever lately. Why? It's to the point that I call out of work just to not feel distressed. I've watched a lot of your videos about quitting your job if you're miserable, but in my case, I have no savings and I'm actually in the process of filing for bankruptcy. Which, what would you recommend to mentally prepare for this job? I'm at the point where I don't enjoy it. My manager is a micromanager and it's slow season for my pressure washing business. To go apply to other banks. You know, quitting your job when you're in his situation is not practical. Quitting your job after you've applied to 900 banks, you know, on LinkedIn and Indeed and those other, and putting up your Indeed profile, like that's practical. Like again, like we need to, we need to, you know, Angel says, say something in Spanish. I took Spanish. Can you give me my report card? I said, can you, can you, I said, can you put my Spanish, can you put my, I just need people to understand. This is my report card. I don't know if this is gonna zoom in here. It is, but it will. Like I took Spanish twice. I got nothing but these. I took a junior and senior year. That's on the right side, because if you look at my full report card, I actually failed German, freshman and sophomore year, and in New Jersey, if you don't pass two years of language, you can't graduate high school. So I literally, literally the only word I can say in Spanish is olá. Anyway, by the way, my eighth grade Spanish name was Geraldo, and I just thought that was a fun fact for everybody if you wanted to know. Yeah, so yes, you should quit that job, because you hate your manager. It doesn't sound like you hate the banking job or say, people don't realize like, I just don't understand this dwelling. Like if I hated my job, I'm applying to a, this is all about practicality. You know, yesterday we talked about AO, right? We talked about accountability and optimism, but there's a PEO part of it as well, because like if you actually get into practicality, like the practical answer to this question is, fucking go apply to every bank in a 40 mile radius. Do you know, Erin, I had like a real conversation like this with a friend, and when I told them some version of this, they said no, because the other bank in this scenario, it was a hardware store. I was like, apply to every hardware store. And he's like, yeah, but this hardware store is an extra 20 minute commute. This is what, you understand this is what's going on out there, right? Like it's just complainer city USA. How many of you live in complainer city USA? Please put CC USA, own it right now, be vulnerable on fucking Halloween. Don't go eat a fucking Snickers and a Hershey kiss. Come in here and fucking own it with me and put CC USA in here, because you're not going to get a fucking holiday. CC USA in here, because you realize you just are looking to fucking complain. And I appreciate all of you, Queen Elizabeth 444. I appreciate you, Jarrod J. Let's fucking own it. Stop being a complainant bitch. Stop it. Complaining doesn't work. It's all you doers. You're fucking, you're rolling in your own shit. You're rolling in your own shit. You hate your fucking banking job? You're bankrupt? Get another fucking banking job. Man, that's it. You know, like, I don't know. Like, it's just real out here. Like, do shit. Like, everything's hard. I don't know. I don't not know why everyone thinks everything should be easy. It's always been hard. It's always been hard. It's hard. And once you fall in love with hard, it gets good. Just fall in love with hard things. If your 16-year-old son wants to be a mechanic, but has never tried to actually put anything together or take anything apart, what advice would you give him and how would you support him? I would make him do it. I think my advice would be like, Salvatore, you know, I love you, boy. But if you want to be a mechanic, you have to work with your hands. Like, hey, if you're someone to be good at basketball, but it's never dribbled the ball, what would you tell him? Dribble a fuck? Ball, what would you tell him? Dribble a fucking ball, Salvatore? Fuck. Mom, you know the answer to this. What kind of question is this, Salvatore's mom? Make the fucking kid shrink it something. Fucking make him do something. Salvatore's mom, I got an idea. Break your fucking dishwasher, like break it. And then say, yo, fucking Salvatore, fix it. Mom, I don't know how. Use chat, GBT, bitch. I'm right. I'm right, Sid. What do you want from me? Can you hear me, Gary? I can hear you, Jim. I heard you last time, and it sounds like what not's going to be able to hear you. And they can hear you. And can everyone hear me? Start from the top, Jim, with those beautiful accolades that made my heart feel so good. Well, as I mentioned, you are a humble person, despite everyone thinking otherwise. No? You can't even. Oh, I can hear you. I was agreeing with you that you're clearly very emotionally intelligent, because you're right. I have so much provado and all this stuff. But in my actions, my humility is my superpower. Right. So let me start at the beginning. When I was a kid, my aunt sent me a jet's jersey. So I've been rooting for the jet since I was seven years old. Wesley Walker, blind in one eye. My favorite receiver. I loved him. And then? Number 84. Number 85. One of my favorite players of all time. I went to St. Louis University. And one of the few players to ever come out of St. Louis University is Pat Leahy. Number five. I've been carrying around this chart to give to you for a really long time, because I know number five is important for you. Right? I love Pat Leahy. He was our kicker of my whole childhood. And he wore number five. And because five was the jersey my mom knitted for me, I felt a kinship to him. Other than, his hairline was very similar to what your hairline is right this minute. Remember, he was like ball dish. It was weird. Well, he works now at the Home Depot in St. Louis. So he my friend got me. Fuck you. He literally works at Home Depot in St. Louis. I'm literally going there on a vlog to shake his hand. We're going to clip this. We're booking it. I'm going to St. Louis in Q1 to the Home Depot. Jim, I need you to tell me which Home Depot email me at garyfbfriends.com. I'm literally going to go there just to shake Pat Leahy's hand. I might bring my friend Al. He'll enjoy it too. I'm fucking going to St. Louis, everyone. All right, go ahead, Jim. So when I read Crush It, I've done everything that you said. I have documented the journey. And after you started Tea with Gary V, I started the immigration answer show. So I have done 935 episodes hour, hour and a half where immigrants can just call and ask me whatever question they want. Well, in the last year or so, it has shifted very much so. From technical questions about the law to like, they're scared, they're worried, they're nervous. And so I, number one, I'm getting ready to hit episode 1000. So I was wondering if you would come on for like 20 minutes one day. We could record it. Five. Five. Five minutes. Yes, sir. I'll take it. I'll take five minutes. That would be great. But what advice do you have? I love whenever you talk about immigrants and I love your immigrant story. I talk about you all the time on the show and everyone on the show knows who you are. What can I do to help immigrants sort of feel safer or messaging that you have? By telling them what life's actually about, which is you can't control what you can't control. You know what I mean, brother? Like it's a very challenging time. People see this issue on both sides. I'm empathetic to how people see the world. Everyone's allowed to see it differently. No question. Immigrants, not only in America, but a lot of police around the world are in fear mode. Right. And the reality is, is that my number one thing to say to both people, by the way, to both people who deeply, deeply are scared of immigrants, sadly, because people have weaponized that narrative or in reverse immigrants that are scared to be deported is you cannot control anything actually, and you must adjust to reality. And that's that. There is, watch this, watch this, Jim. Hey, everybody in the whatnot chat. How many of you are struggling financially and emotionally right now? Please say struggling in the chat. Like real talk. Like just like real life, you know, let's be vulnerable. How many people said they're struggling live in America? Struggling financially and emotionally and live in America. Say America in the chat. This is what I tell my immigrant friends, Jim, who are struggling like living in America. Listen, I think living in America is remarkable. Land of opportunity. I still believe it at the highest levels, even more with what's going on with AI and everything. While people think less, they're like, I'm going to get fired and sober. In fact, you're going to get fired and then start your dream life for a lot of people. A lot of people know, but a lot of people. Yes. But you cannot control everything. And so, Jim, you got to get to the root. The reason you like me is, and you've been following for a while is I go to the root canal, not to the surface level. I'm not worried about getting you like some toothpaste that does white, you know, whitening. I want to get into the fucking root canal rips. So, you need to get to the root canal, Jim, and tell them that you can't control how this is going to play out. You just can't. And you can't spend every day in fear. And you must wrap your head around that if you are no longer in the United States, you will go back to the country you were born in and you will make a remarkable life and you may find yourself back in the United States or in Portugal that's taking a lot of people right now or in Canada. There's so much opportunity around the world. America is not the only place to find happiness. In fact, we just watched more than half of the chat speak about struggling both mentally and financially right here in America. So America is not the variable of happiness. You are the variable of happiness and making your happiness. And that's that. That's the real answer. Gary, thanks so much. I got my first V-Friends resource. I took the quiz. So I was really excited. I got a hoodie coming. So I'm excited about that. Thank you for everything that you've done. Thank you for literally changing my life and the life of all the immigrants that I've been able to help. You get credit for all that. You get credit. No, you get credit, brother. I might have been a seed, but you fucking you executed. And I cherish all of you in the chat and all of you watching right now that have taken a word or a video of mine and actually done something with it in a world where millions don't. And I applaud you, sir. And I can't wait. I hope to see you at that Home Depot with me. And I can't wait for my five minutes to be on the podcast. Please email me at garyfvfriends.com. I will set it up. What would you recommend to somebody who is passionate about being a business owner, but also has a chronic illness that makes them bedridden for one to sometimes two weeks per month? Give themselves grace. I admire them so much. Like, don't be yourself up. You have a chronic illness. You know, I really want to talk about grace this morning and the graceful goldfish, one of the underrated V friends, and I can't wait to develop that character. I don't know if there's any graceful goldfish collectors in here. I want, I want, there was a woman. What was her name again? Kayla. Kayla, I want you to give yourself grace, Kayla. Like you have a chronic illness. You didn't control that. That was God's plan. I think that you should give yourself grace. You can't hustle 18 hours a day, 365 days a year. You just can't. I want people who lost a loved one, like a parent, someone they really love, God forbid a child or a spouse. If you're struggling right now and you're watching, I want you to give yourself grace. Of course you can't go grind. If that happened to me, I'm not fucking building V friends the next day. I'm, I'm, I'm dwelling. I'm mourning. Please give yourself grace to mourn. Right? If, if you're starting your journey to building yourself back up and you've realized that you were suppressing very deep angers or upsetness towards a parent or an inappropriate uncle or an illness that your mother had with alcohol, like give yourself a little grace. Now don't dwell in it. Don't dwell in it and lay in it forever, but give yourself some grace everyone. Like you can't go hard if you don't have fuel. People asked me like, you know, yesterday was like, what drugs Gary beyond gratitude? Fuck face. Happiness. Of course I can go hard 15 hours a day. I'm not weighed down. I really want you to give yourself grace. And I make mistakes, big mistakes. When I, Mr. Gratitude and happy, like wake up on a gloomy day. I'm like, I'm not like, oh shit, I suck now. You don't suck. Someone said I suck earlier in here when I was saying who's struggling. I saw it in the chat. You do not suck. Mr. Santino said my mom died at 48 from a stroke. She's all I had. Not true brother. Mr. Santino, yes and no. Your memories of her, you know, are what you have now and your ability to find love in other areas, whether it's through companionship or even friendship. How many people here really love their best friend like that? Like really love them like that. Court? Sid? Yeah. When I talk, do you know that the only time I get choked up is when I talk about my parents at award shows and publicly and the only other time I've ever, ever in my life got choked up that way was when I talked about Brandon. Even right now I just said it as I said his name. That's how much I love him. So you know, like there's the people you're born into and there's the people that, I did retire yesterday, but I'm back. I'm retired. I did retire here live on this show, but I'm back one day later. You know, I'm very, by the way, I can see it already. Is anyone here in doubt that I'm going to be in a stadium with 40,000 people and be like, hey, so give yourself grace. How do I protect my personal brand as deep fakes are becoming an issue with popular creators? That's undecided. I am about to send a big push to all of you to follow me on Sora too, where you guys can all make videos of me. I'm going the other way. I am going to use deep fakes to build my brand. So for example, here said, can you take this and play it over? This is something great and made on the team. We're testing. I think they can hear it. I think they can. Good. Can you guys hear it? Yeah. You think I'll ever slow me down? You don't know your boy. You don't know your boy. Hey, you think I'll ever slow me down? You don't know your boy. All right, there's that. Which one? Oh, this is amazing. Hello. Oh my God. Sorry, man. Didn't think I'd scare you that bad. You got me. My heart is racing. My bad. Seriously. Good boy. It's kind of peaceful out here. Hello. Oh my God. Dude. Sorry, man. Didn't think I'd scare you that bad. You got me. My heart is racing. My bad. So I'm going the other way. I'm going to soon give you guys all an invite code. I'm going to post on my Instagram and all my socials. You're all going to follow me on Sora2. And I'm going to open up my entire IP and you guys can make videos of me all day. How do you protect your IP? You can lawyer up or you can take a surfboard and look at the board. You can take a surfboard and ride it.
