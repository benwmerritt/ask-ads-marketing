## Transcript
For the first time ever in the 15 years of social media, how many followers you have? No longer matters as much. I've spent 15 years amassing 60 million followers and someone in this room can post a video tomorrow on TikTok and get more views than I get, which is insane. The merit is on the individual piece of content. Social media is disproportionately the most important opportunity for this room and yet we continue to underestimate it for 95% of this room if this room was making one or two videos a day on their phone in their hotel room right now about insights or thoughts they have that impact their customers. Whether it's new tax law or opportunities, if they just made a video and said, I'm Carl, I live in the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio. I'm a CPA, I do this. Here's the fun fact of the day or the thing that is top of mind or the biggest mistake people just made during this last tax season or where most of you just left money on the table. XYZ, XYZ, XYZ and Carl upstairs posted that video organically on LinkedIn, on Facebook, and then took $50 and ran ads in the five mile radius of his office for that video, $50, the five mile radius of his office. There is a stunning percentage likelihood that Carl would pick up a customer today. Do you know what else I know? None of those people in this audience did that today. So what do I think? I think that there is a naivete in the world and definitely in this room on how powerful social media marketing is. It's now been around long enough that it's not the shiny new thing. Many of you actually watch this, this will be fun for you, Mon. How many people here have tried social media marketing but it's not really worked for your business the way you've liked? Raise your hand. I'm sure it's plenty. Just raise your hand please. Raise it high. Don't be shy. Right? All right. So the seven or eight people that raised their hand, which is a whole nother fucking problem. I'm a little frightened. But for the 10 to 12 people that raised their hand, you have to understand because it didn't work, doesn't mean that social media doesn't work. It means that they didn't do a good job at it. And this is important to understand. You know, I don't know if you know this, but if you play professional basketball, you make an extraordinary amount of money. I would really like to do that. I don't have the skill set to do that. Thus, I don't get the results. I am going to spend the next hour here desperately trying to motivate, encourage, eliminate excuses of the collective group in here around contemporary marketing and technology because the history of business is completely easy to understand, which is the following. Whoever takes advantage of the opportunities, both in the technologies that are available to them at that moment, and the marketing arbitrage that sits of the moment, win. When the radio was invented, many businesses exploded because we went from JustPrint to a radio device, and some of the most iconic brands, Coca-Cola, leveraged a new medium called radio. Procter and Gamble is one of the biggest consumer brand companies in the world because they were the leading advertiser on television in the 50s and 60s while their competitors were still figuring it out. Social media is disproportionately the most important opportunity for this room. And yet, we continue to underestimate it, and that is what I want to get everyone to understand in this room, that it will lead to new customers, and too many people here are relying on the word of mouth of their reputation of being in the business in their area for a long period of time, and they will get outflanked by people that use these platforms, and I think that's a mistake. Talk a little bit about, you know, the sort of range of people on social. A lot of people in this room, you know, have challenged getting staff, and staffing is a giant issue for this profession. How come we be authentic with their social media posting and still, you know, live into who they are, but also attract and get in front of people who might be interested in working there, as well as just making sure their clients feel connected and engaged? Is this something that you can do in a different way? Yeah, I mean, I think at the end of the day, I think a lot of you have built your careers through your people skills, right? It's not super complicated. I think people struggle to be authentic on camera because people are insecure, and people change in front of a camera because they're worried about judgment on the other side. Humans buy from humans, and some people overthink variables. I think a lot of us in this room are not Gen Alpha, and we remember where, you know, a suit and tie and the way you presented yourself was an imperative variable. I think we can all agree the world has become dramatically more casual. I'm wearing a baseball cap. Things have changed, and I think that the authenticity is an incredibly easy game once you understand what's actually happening here, which is humans will always buy from humans when they trust. It's very hard to trust someone when you can feel it's not fully them. They're holding back. So, you know, all I would do is encourage people to not overthink what they're saying on video or in the written word or the copy that supports a picture they put out on these mediums, because that's what's hurting people. But I'll be honest with you, Monica, I'm not worried about that. I'm worried that I believe that every business in this room should be posting two times a day, minimally, on these platforms to get employees and to get customers, and I think we're millions of miles away from that in this room. It sounds like the mistake is not making mistakes. It's not doing it at all. That's right. I think people have done a ton of different things with social media that's hurting you. I think a lot of you don't post on it on an ideology of what you think about social media. You know, there's a lot of people here who don't post on social media because they have a philosophical point of view about what social media means to society. I want the kids to go outside and play too. But your political views or your ideologies of how the world should be should be left at the door when we're talking about making money. So I think people haven't put in the work to figure out how to be good at it, what platforms do what, what does the first three seconds have to look like in a video to get people to actually watch it, what's the copy that puts it. So there's just a lot of 101 hurdles that I want to get through. But you know, as far as employee acquisition, it again, it is disproportionately the way things are working right now. This same 15, 10 mile radius advertising that I'm telling you about to get a customer is exactly how you're going to find those needles in the rough that you're looking for for employees because it is not lost on me. The friction of this industry is now finding with the expectation of compensation that the youth that used to drive so much of the scale is looking for in comparison to what you can actually pay them. But good news, AI is going to replace them all and so you'll be fine. So I'm embarrassed to say that I spend more time on Facebook than other channels at FIH and gender. Do they have to be in Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn and Facebook? If they want money. Like what are we talking about here? You don't have to do anything. You're more than allowed to slowly go out of business. You know, I'm being serious with this. Like look, what can I tell you? Like I don't, I didn't want to wake up this morning and go to the gym. I really didn't. Like I just think that this is, we're talking about business and work. I didn't make up the rules. I'm not happy that marketing changes every minute. I wish it was the 1950s. I would be Don Draper. I'd be in Midtown Manhattan right now having a cocktail and doing business. I don't like the this stuff changes. You've seen my career for 20 years. I've been on top of everything. Do you know what it feels like to be at the top of the game and then see TikTok come along and be like, damn it, now I have to learn all this too? Like I'm not thrilled. I like easy to. I'm a human. Do they have to be? They don't have to do anything. But you're missing opportunity for customers and employees if you're not on these channels. You're allowed to decide. But the world's changing. How many people here get business from Google AdWords? Raise your hand. Raise it high, please. I'm just trying to get a sense. Great. So for the seven or eight people that just raised their hands, again a problem. We'll get to that in a minute. I mean, Google's in trouble. Right now as we all sit here, AI, how many people now use chat, gbt or Proplexity to do search instead of just Google? Raise your hands. Raise it high. Actually, stand up. If you don't mind, please don't be lazy on me. I want your fellow teammates to see this. This is a good showing. Please keep standing up if this is you. This is important. This is a room that barely raised its hands for social media marketing and search. And yet more than half the room, and again, this is not the Silicon Valley elite we're looking at right now. More than half the room right now is now using chat gbt versus Google. This is a profound indication that I want you to see what he thinks happening to Google AdWords if all these people are no longer even seeing it. You can sit. Thank you. So things are changing. Google AdWords is going to look like the yellow pages in seven years. That's crazy. So for that gentleman in the white shirt and others that raised their hand, they're going to start losing those customers from that channel. We have to continue to adjust. That's, I just don't know anything else than adapt or die. I prefer not to die in business. It's about outcome. All right. Well, let's let's talk a little bit more about AI. Okay. Obviously, it's here to say it's scary in some cases, but it can create efficiencies. Which of this room be thinking about for AI in our day to day? I mean, you just talked about chat gbt, but what else can you offer? Well, I think, you know, it all depends on how you want to look at it. Like the reality is, this is the biggest technology shift that we've faced since the internet itself. This is big, big. Let there be no confusion. This is the biggest opportunity to people in this room. And this is the single thing that's going to put people out of business in this room. It's black and white. So I think first and foremost, actually, this is a good question for this room. How many people in this room are retiring in the next five years? And I don't mean you're going to crush it and like dominate the next five years and buy an island. I mean, you're old and you're finished. So, two, three, four, five, six. All right. So for the, oh, seven. So for the seven people that just raised their hands, I have some good news. You'll probably be able to use one of my least favorite business strategies, which is this, on this issue and probably see yourself out for the rest of the people in this room. The as much and I could speak for five hours on why I think social media videos and advertising will change your life. For as much passion as I have on that, I'd be willing for you to never do social media marketing in exchange for you spending one hour a day going forward learning about AI and using AI. This is big, big, man. This is big, big, big, big, big, like nothing scares me given who I am as a businessman and entrepreneur. This has eaten up an enormous amount of my time in the last year to protect myself from having my companies exist. Here's why. This technology will be better at doing my taxes for me than anybody in this room and it won't even be close. That's it. I don't know what else to say and it will take one second and that's real. I don't know how you don't focus on what does that mean. This leads to why I want so many people to build personal brand in here. I believe one of the few things that will be defensible in the next decade or two is people wanting to do things with you and I think the way people want to do things with you is they discover you and see you every day on the internet. The task at hand is profound. The AI is able to do all the work and that's that and I don't know how to sugar code it. There's a couple things. In the next five years, 10 years before consumers fully go to a place where they are using these tools at scale, for a lot of people in the next two or three tax seasons, if they listen to me and learn how to use AI over the next year, next year's tax season, it will be them and AI doing all the work and they will never worry about the issues that are having with employees or outsourcing to the Philippines or anything else ever again. I think that's great news. I mean this is a relationship business. Trust is paramount. If they can take away some of the menial tasks and focus on the relationships and the consulting that is where they make the money. That's second part. I think this is not lost on any of you. I know a lot of you are moving in this direction. Getting into the consulting, being the right hand, it's just going to become imperative. Trust is going to become so uncomfortably important. Trust over task should sit as a sign about everybody's computer screen. It should be your wallpaper on your iPhone right now. Trust over task. Getting paid for just the blocking and tackling of what you've done historically is going to get harder and harder. Getting more integrated and becoming a coincidier to these businesses I think has incredible merit and would be 100% what I would be doing if I was sitting out there. So this group would not say that they're bleeding edge, you don't say. But they want to be in the mix. They know that they need to be in the game. How can they be on trend related to AI and not bleeding edge? By the way, when I say you don't say, I go to every one of these events with zero pre-judgment or what have you. My answer is based on the fact that so few people are doing the social media marketing and the Google AdWords. But I have good news. What's amazing about technology is you could have missed every trend of the last decade and if you actually decide to get serious and do the homework an hour a day, what does the AI mean? How do I use AI? And AI is crazy itself. You can use AI to get smart about AI. You can literally go into chat, GVT and be like literally this is what you type in. All right, this morning I was at a keynote with Gary Vaynerchuk and he made me feel some sort of way. Like you could literally type these kind of things in. I am an accountant, I am a CF fractional, CFO, whatever it might be. You can literally talk to it on like literally for seven minutes. Seven minutes. The biggest issue right now for a lot of you using AI is you don't know how to be good at using AI yet. Remember when we first started using search engines? We didn't know what we were doing either. The first time I used a search engine I just typed in wine enter. I didn't know. You got better at it. You're going to get better at using chat, GVT and things of that nature. But you can literally talk out and say what are the 13 apps I should be using if I'm an accountant to save myself 10 to 15 hours a week on tasks that I might be doing in Excel? I mean it's incredible. Like literally talk to it like you're talking to a therapist or a strategist. It's profound. I don't even type. I literally audio it. So I get every nuance of what I want in there. So I think what I'm excited about, what motivates me to continue to do what I'm doing right in this stand-off second, is I'm desperate for one person in this audience to hear me and say you know what? I have an hour a day. Yeah, like I'm doing this for another 20 years. I don't want to fall behind. This is real stuff. Gary's not wrong. Let me put in the hour a day. And you could literally go from someone who's been not on the bleeding edge to being the most bleeding edge because you put in the work. I genuinely think about it like health and wellness. This will not be lost on this crew. I'm sure you're aware maybe you've lived this in your life or you've seen it in someone that you know. Some people do not live healthy for 20 years eating, drinking, staying up like no exercise, and then they just start. And it's a little ugly at first. It's hard. But a year later it's a lot better. And that's exactly how I feel about this technology thing. You might have been the person that like passed on learning how to do research and you kept doing direct mail instead. You decided social media was stupid. You might you could have not apps. Like you could be that person. And yet tomorrow you can decide that this keynote this morning motivated you and you agree. And now you spend an hour a day researching. And you could be cutting edge in a year. And I could not recommend that more because I believe that this AI thing is big, big. And some of you are old enough looking around here to remember we underestimated the internet. And a lot of the internet companies have been a problem for our business too. And this is bigger than that. Right. So not just in your business. You spend time with a lot of companies all year round as well. What's an example and it doesn't have to be AI specifically. Yep. Other kinds of automation. But how it looks a great example of a company that used automation or AI to sell their strategic services or build another business. Like do something drastically different. Well I mean you know what's that is just I would argue that's the plight of everything. Let me let me give you an example. When the iPhone was invented it changed the landscape. Right. And so when when I I basically think of that as the watershed moment that we all live in today. I mean when I think about companies that have built things. I think about things like Uber like completely trans word. Like Waymo I mean self driving like like what about the way people order from restaurants. Do you remember. Again this is what's fun. Not talking to a high school crowd. Like you remember that we used to like have to go into our kitchen drawer and find a menu and call the restaurant and stay on hold and place the order. And like like think like my answer to your question is everything. Like every business has transformed. People have taken market share. People have evolved. Look what's happened to retail. Like everybody in this room now has the expectations that they can order a blender and it should be at their house in a couple hours. Not wait to Saturday to go to you know like I mean it's funny how that question formed in my head mom like I don't think anything's the same. Look at dating. Again that's actually worse in some ways. I mean not I mean just like the apps instead of the personal connection. I don't know like dating. That's a high resolution. Yeah but but it's but remember like the app is just a gateway drug to get you there. Right. It's just the technology to get you to the date. I do not think like randomly going to bars with you know the hope of finding your spouse 30 years ago is some ideologically better thing than you know using an app to find someone you're attracted to or have a conversation with to then create a date later. Right. I think that what we do is society and business people are very good about being romantic about yesterday and demonizing tomorrow. I remember when like a couple years ago when people were like you should send people letters that's good. I'm like why like why did we put like writing on a piece of paper and sending it in the mail on this ideological pedestal versus sending a text. I understand why we did it. We decided that that was more effort and meant more but so is like walking instead of driving. So is a million things. I think we are incredibly scared of being left behind but I want to remind everybody here you're only left behind if you choose to be lazy. Exactly. And but I want to say something that's important to me. This room is full of judgment. You're business owners and executives. You've judged Gen Z workers for the last five years. You love to say in my day during tax season I would have worked 800 hours a week and got paid a dollar. These fucking kids are full of... Right. Right. This crew has judged the living crap. A lot of people in this room have been successful. You've judged. You have so much pride in how hard you've worked. I know this crew. I am this crew. Here's my problem. Why are you being lazy now? You judge people being lazy and things that come easy to you. I'm not interested in what comes easy. I'm interested in what comes hard. I get that you didn't grow up with AI and social media. News alert. I'm 49. I didn't either. But I put in the work. I got quiet in here, Mon. I want to talk about something that I saw this week from you that spoke to me. Okay. And it's about how we feel as humans. There was a post that got into what you give out you get back. It's about our narrative and if you think about what you post... Actually, a conversation in your kitchen, we're talking about a waski trip and all of a sudden we all know 30 minutes later we're seeing destinations and ski sales in our fees. But you talked about if you're trying to feel better and be more positive what you put out there is what you get back. Can you talk about that because I thought that was amazing. What I was referring to in this piece of content that went viral this last week is people think the algorithm is changing you. A lot of you have demonized social media because you think it's bad and it's trying to pump certain things. What I don't think any of you realize is your news feed, your algorithm, is actually exposing who you actually are not changing who you are. And in the video I said you want me to prove this to you. I've got a way to do it. And by the way I hope some of you do this what I'm about to say. If you want to go into Facebook right now or Instagram or whatever, app you use, TikTok, if you go into the search at the top and you type in motivation, positivity, good news, good vibes, happiness, joy, you type that in and you get results. And in those results you go to all the videos, 2050 in the video I said 200 of them and you like 200 of them and you leave 25 comments on the posts. The next morning when you wake up your entire algorithm will look different. The end. The end. And so I think that humans have become incredibly good at not being accountable. We have become the generation, including our generation, of pointing fingers not thumbs. It's this president's fault, it's that president's fault. It's my mom's fault, it's my dad's fault. If my boss's fault, it's China's fault. It's everyone's fault but ourselves. Because I'm such an advocate for marketing on social media, I'll be at an airport. This happened several times in the last year and a parent will come up to me like Gary V, big fan, but I gotta tell you I really don't like that you push social media. It's really bad and I don't like my 14 year old being on TikTok and I look at these people and I'm like so take it off their phone. The hell do you want from me? I'm literally talking about these things from a business lens. I'm not telling people that it's good for their health or they should do it. If you don't like it on your child's phone, be a goddamn parent and delete it off the phone. Amen is right. In the same way that I'm concerned that a lot of people have ideologies or political views about these things right now and not using it for their business. If I didn't, you know you know this about me. I'm inherently incredibly private. I've posted more than any human in the last 20 years but none of my family, no pictures of my kids, none of my personal beings. I'm private. I don't want to share that. I view these things as business tools. This is marketing and sales and recurring revenue and real life that you need to pay your income and your taxes on. Your life is dependent on your business. These tools are incredible for that but yes I think that a lot of people in this room, if you don't like what you're getting in your feeds and you're feeling depressed, it's because you got sucked into fear. My friends, mainstream media pushes fear both sides. It's all fear based and then humans on social media amplify that stuff. It's just fear and I don't believe in that fear. The data is very very black and white my friends, letting me say this nice and slow to everybody. I really want you to leave with this this morning. As we sit in this room this morning, this is the greatest moment to be alive as a human being. For life expectancy, for civility, for all the things that you think are happening bad in the world, people are like, mom it's so crazy. People are like, Gary the kids especially are really sucked into this bullshit. They're like, Gary it's never been worse. I'm like bro do you know what the Holocaust was? Have you ever, did you have history class? Do you know what the Black Plague was? You know what Hiroshima is? Like people are like, you know that everybody used to die of heart attack? Our grandparents generation all died of heart attacks. We didn't have that figured out yet. Remember when people like when most of this crew was kids? When somebody lived to 60, we're like oh not bad. And so I think people are delusional and have bought into the wrong narrative and so to answer your question fully, you don't like what your feed looks like. You can change it today in two hours. The end. Love it. All right let's talk a little bit about making the shift. So again we're you know we want to move toward an advisory mindset. How does this group, this room, become more entrepreneurial and innovative? Look I think I always think about the path that has least financial you know because I was born in the Soviet Union so I grew up very very poor immigrant life. Like my family business had no money so everything I think about is how do you use the least amount of money to make the most amount of stuff to happen? And that's why I'm obsessed with social. I don't know if you know this it's free. Like you know that's crazy right? Like I'm a marketer like direct mail, newspaper ads, radio, television, billboards. I did all that stuff for my family business. That all cost money. When you send direct mail like hey use me for taxi that costs money. Social media is free. Free. So I believe the and I'm just going to be very prescriptive about this. I believe people in this room taking a phone to their face every day and giving advice as if they were giving advice to a client in front of them. Things to think about. You know what's amazing about this group is that it has incredible amounts of experience and pattern recognition of what common problems are mistakes people make issues. If you put that out there it will come back to you. I believe that is the entrepreneurial spirit that people need here which is the biggest opportunity in marketing history to get new customers is sitting in front of them right now and most of us are not taking advantage of it. And I hate to be a dead horse but I also hate making up stuff that isn't true. There's not a lot of things I can think of that are going to crush for this room with very little cost. That is the thing. Daily videos on Facebook. Especially Facebook because after you post the video organically on your page this little move that I keep telling you about to spend $50 a hundred dollars to amplify the video locally is the best tactic for businesses in this room right now. All right. So I mentioned earlier the staff and challenge. Yeah. And potentially for the younger people but it goes beyond that. So what about culture? I mean you talk a lot about culture. Talk about how this room can build the culture of innovation culture that they can attract not just younger people but also engage with their audience. How many people here have more than five employees? Raise your hand. Love it. So let's start with that part. I could not recommend more until I had 150 employees in my company I met with every employee one on one multiple times a year. Dinners. Group dinners. One on one dinners. 15 minute meeting check-ins. The way you build culture is by giving a crap. There are people in this room who have 10 employees who've not had a one-on-one for an hour with two of their employees in the last three years because we get caught up in other things. I get it. But I could not recommend more the thesis that has built every one of my businesses which is I work for them they don't work for me. The second you actually believe that and I'm not saying that up here as like a cheerleader rah rah rah I'm saying it because I believe the number one vulnerability a lot of you have is lack of retention. Right that's what you don't want to happen. I know. I know your business well enough to know right you'd like to have the same crew. It's easier. I really believe the way you retain people is by caring about them and realizing that they all have different wants and needs. I think the thing that was really eye-opening to me growing up you know my father spent the first 23 years of his life in the Soviet Union and so when I started working for my dad he was the scariest meanest boss I had ever seen. He was really tough on his employees and it was just Soviet stuff you know it was just because in the Soviet Union I know you guys are a bunch of Americans let me educate you on what goes on over there. It was all black market. Everybody stole from every you know thing because it was all communism and it was just yucky. So literally when I was 14 this is a funny story real quick for one second. The first day I ever worked in my dad's business I was 14 years old. We lived 40 minutes from the store. My dad wakes me up at 7 a.m. I'm like devastated this sucks you know like he's dragging me to the store. My dad is the opposite of me. The dude does not talk. So we literally literally drive 40 minutes and my father does not say one word to me. We pull up into the parking lot. He turns to me and in a heavy Ivan Drago accent looked at me and said keep an eye on the employees they steal. That was the culture I was brought up in and every essence of my body thought it was wrong because my mother was a complete angel and saw the world completely different and I was raised by that woman at that point. I promised myself at 15 that I would be the best possible time. The biggest thing that I learned in this quest to be that good is that employees have different wants and needs and it changes every year. The reason I want you to meet with your employees all the time is because this year Johnny wants a $5,000 raise. Maybe you don't want to give it to him but that's what he wants and maybe in three years because he just had his first child he wants a little more work-life balance during tax season which you may not want to give. But by talking to your employees constantly you will have a better pulse of what makes them tick and it will give you the optionality to be able to feed that appetite at the time which creates a higher propensity for you to create the retention that you're looking for. I believe in culture over everything. Absolutely over everything. All right well we have a ton of people in this room and I'm sure would like to hear more from you and you know you shared a lot obviously you know we're keen to understand individually how you can help but I would love to open up for this group to ask some questions. Gareth's willing to take anything and everything you care about and we have some people who will be around the room with mics so you don't have to yell just raising hand it's a welcome over to you and feel free to ask him anything. And truly anything like it could be a one-on-one question it could be something that you've seen me talk about that we didn't touch on here this is literally my favorite part of the whole talk so thank you for having me and thanks man my man what's your name Good morning this is Devan Bhai. You spoke about trust over task. Yes. And the era of AI the routine gets taken over by technology. Yes. But that being said what would ultimately be at the edge of the technology of evolution is it perception which will drive commerce or value which will take commerce or perception to drive value as well. Perception is reality. There will be perception. There will only be perception. Of course it's how we make decisions. You get it? Yeah. So expertise competence. Will be commoditized. Consideration comes from relevance. The reason people consider things consider who they marry consider what they buy consider who they do business with it comes from a place of relevance right. Why do immigrants do business with immigrants right if there's a relevance right relevance not just trust in fact I come from Russian culture Russians don't trust Russians at all they still do business with them because of relevance so I think at the edge of this it will be relevance hence why I'm pushing all of you to build personal brand because I believe that is disproportionately your biggest moat. Thank you. Cheers. Questions. Hi Errandi. My name is Taley. I work at Inger and you said something that really stood out to me. You said so many people were in me into size yesterday and demised tomorrow. Can you talk about that further detail maybe give a couple of examples of that? Hey Leigh I think it's just how humans work. I think we're romantic about how it used to be. Like I don't know like you know I think every example is that I brought up the letter like why writing a letter aren't the words the purpose there why are we putting the medium on a pedestal you know like people it makes sense as humans our lives were much easier when we were children and what we worried about was so mundane a test or this or your crush not liking you as you get older you start worrying about bigger things so you know I think in general it's just the human plight and we just continue to let me give you an example Uber I was an early investor in Uber. It was wild watching people go through that you know like think about how crazy Uber is now. We people talk about you know how it used to be so safe when we were kids and we would hitchhike and all this you know some of the OGs in here. Do you know that there are 13 year old girls all across the country going into strangers cars every day on Uber and parents feel safer with that but at first they were scared about it now they feel more safe with it like like I just think that we you know really really really have this inherent human structure to say it used to be better. The good old days and I get it I like my good old days too I like going outside in the summer and playing and all that but it's it's the good old days for kids right now like nine year olds are going to think this was mundane because we're going to all be robots in 30 years like and I need this very seriously all of you are demonizing this right now as this is some awful device this is going to look like a beeper in 30 years it's going to be nothing nothing in the next decade we're all going to be wearing glasses that are going to be AI and AR and VR technology doubt we're not even going to have phones and you are all in this room in 15 years going to be like man it was so much better when it was just a cell phone all of you and so you know there's a billion examples you may it is so amazing how you called out our kitchen by even lounge so should be I was literally seeing in the mirror called bringing the sex of a torch right so I mean as an entrepreneur as a fiorfesh that right one of the holy grails is getting the nap of digital marketing I mean in this room accepting you at this point if anyone has got the digital marketer commit to an outcome right and then we've just won the battle right in terms of finding the talent it's it seems like a holy grail where we never get there we actually pay for their exploration that's been my experience of working with digital marketing right so some insights on that and if you could just say that if Gary was was to start this fresh from today how would you do it if I was just thank you if it was starting fresh from today the only thing I think about when I'm starting a business is creating demand because it's oxygen the reason I love marketing is its offense there's operations there's balancing your checkbook there's culture like I just talked about but what I know is that more revenue solves all problems the thing I'm trying to get everybody here is to really understand offense most people in here as you know rely on retention not growth right they're like yeah but I've been with my people for 12 years or 16 years and I'm concerned because I think there's a lot of technology coming that usually looks the part of the thing that stops people with working with the person they've always worked with when it's that convenient and that well priced it becomes a problem I you know I've been an og in technology I had one of my first talks ever was to a bunch of people that own bookstores telling them that amazon was a problem and their answer was you don't get it gary we've been a bookstore for 30 years in stanford connecticut we have a community our people are not going to go on the worldwide web and buy books and I said to them as a kid 18 I said you don't get it convenience is king and so if gary was starting right now in this business I would be making social media posts all day long talking about what I know about tax law or balancing a checkbook or you know cfo for actualization or whatever anyone doesn't hear or business consulting I I put out all my how many people here follow me or have consumed some of my content thank you the people that just raised their hand you know I put out my best information for free I believe that when you put out your best information for free you actually get customers and I think most people here think if they put out information for free they would lose customers that part hi hello my name is webu so you just gave an advice in terms of putting on content so one of the things which I wanted to understand was accounting is such a highly debilitated industry yes so how by not breaking the law but like but real quick I'll tell you why I'm jumping in so quickly I'm on the board of spin master which is the number three toy company toy marketing is more regulated than accounting chases a client visas a client diazio and Budweiser are clients they're alcohol they're incredibly regulated I've run an agency for 15 years that only works with companies that are wildly regulated one post sets us into trouble don't make claims that you can't make okay so the question I have is how can a professional stand out on platforms like linkedin or you said it don't I think for me this room really needs to focus on facebook and linkedin and needs to focus on amplifying their videos with very small media amplifications in a very close radius to their business the reason you're where do you live where's your business brother I come from all the way and I'm exhibiting here at right now understood um Michael what what town do you track what town do you market in my friend Michael Austin if if you market within a 10 mile radius of austin's right then the way you're standing out is by saying I I do services in austin you're winning on relevance of being stand out by being local the biggest advantage all of you have before everybody starts using all these tools is they want to work with somebody in the general area so I think the relevance is coming from the location and then as long as you're speaking about things you're allowed to speak about and speak about how you would go about doing it I think you'll be in a good place I think people I think people don't need much you know they don't need much if you make again this is a great time of year it's post-tax season if you're just making a video every day of like you know one thing that a lot of people miss this tax season because it was a new law that passed last year was x y and z or a watch out or hey you might have been writing this off for the last six years fyi this is our last year that we're going to be able to do it so keep this in mind you're just talking the stuff you know you're talking the stuff you know so I think standing out to me in this room is predominantly Facebook Instagram and LinkedIn I don't need people to go viral on TikTok here because those views may be in places where nobody's going to use you anyway is kind of where I'm at mentally on that thank you sir hi Privyak Privyak so a similar story for me Belarus Israel America one of the things that I found I'm a CPA and a practice is personality and accounting is challenging and so what I do in my firm is encourage people to be themselves and to get out there and do it but it's hard and a lot of times we need to brand as a firm not that as an individual so it's the constant combat I think it's an and okay you know I see this a lot in real estate as well like I think you can brand both you know I think what's amazing about social is because it doesn't cost anything you can post today and you could be about being carol or you could tomorrow you could be like hey it's carol from XYZ firm I think when you fall in love with and versus or it really starts to make social make sense to people this is a philosophical debate that actually ultimately doesn't matter to the end consumer and I think you could just play with both but I think you're making an important point there is something else that I wanted to get to and I appreciate you and you getting me there the other thing you should be so okay you get motivated today and you're like I'm going to do it and you've got six good tips on tax season and then it's next week and you're like all right what do I do now I think one of the things that a lot of you can do is actually talk about your interests I think this is not going to be lost on people there are people in this room that have gotten business because they like golf because they like fishing because they like high school basketball because they like the PTA because they like baking because they like XY and Z the other thing that I would recommend dramatically is taking your interests and integrating them into your social media content as gateways to getting business it's not super complicated like I'll just make up a video right now so it can help everybody hey everybody it's uh it's Rick you know I hear from the outskirts of you know Des Moines like many of you in town I'm a huge fan of our high school basketball team I can't believe they're going for their 18th win I'm also counted in town I know some of you I don't know some of you but very honestly I'm just putting myself out there my business out there more on social media I'm going to start tailgating for this big high school game at f18 two hours before the game and I'm bringing some of my best bourbon and this chicken if anybody wants to join me I'll see you there when you post that and again you spend 25 on people that live within a 10 mile radius you would just be surprised you would just be surprised and what ends up happening in that scenario is three people shop six but there are three or six people in town that you didn't know before who also happen to like the high school basketball team and one of those people become a client it's real life business what's amazing about what I'm talking about Monica is so many people here built their businesses on the old school version of what I'm saying a lot of right a lot of when you moved into town when you started networking you you either had kids that were in little league like I know I can see the heads not like this is how you built your business all I'm saying is that social media can make it 10x the way you did it and there's a lot of people still in town in the general areas and you could create a bigger net I'm giving you five and 10 mile radius some of you live in rural areas and you're willing to drive an hour and a half for a customer so great make it a hundred mile radius next I get a good breed so this question for you you mentioned is a fear factor yes which is a big personal philosophy of mine is dissing age or sad I think yes but I was thinking about how do you apply that professionally and a lot of us deal with clients here so in this day and age do you have tips tricks frameworks to help really destigmatize educate clients because it's a negative environment that permeates business owners so offshore ed team in India I brought to my clients I do the fractionalization CFO you mentioned that nice but technology AI offshore how do we really distill that down because at the end of the day I feel like I'm fighting battles on brief fronts internally with my partners I'm the market building my personal brand network and then ultimately with clients who we're there to deliver for how you really break that down so that they trust you that trust you as an advisor you breathe that to their for me it's been conviction over convincing you know what was worked for me and again it's nice to have such a long relationship with Monica she'll tell you that so many of the things that I brought to the marketing world 15 years ago people didn't believe right like it was just people didn't believe it and I wasn't in the business of convincing not my brother I remember telling my brother that you know we were going to charge a lot more money for monthly social media creative and he was like bro people are not going to pay more than $5,000 a month for this I didn't spend my time trying to convince my brother I spent my time trying to build the capability and have conviction in what I believed and then that execution would be the outcome so I think don't get caught up in convincing your partners or your clients keep putting out the information both one-on-one in meetings and publicly and let the chips fall you got it brother you can't convince the unconvincible you right you just you can't convince certain people it just will never happen it's a huge waste of time so many of you spend so much trying trying to sell to unsellable people just don't do that yes sir hi what is kind of a spalfur and you know a lot of talk today about you know bringing in the business and building that relationship and I'm curious who landed you as a fish I imagine you have you know quite a lot of you know good client to land what relationship do you have with who's responsible for your tax and accounting great question no it's a great question yeah it's it's a great question I like many people in life you know early on in my life just followed who my dad was using my dad was using somebody locally in Springfield New Jersey for his personal business as I started getting older I took my family business from a three million dollar a year business to a 65 million dollar business in five years so you can imagine a lot changed our family quickly and I could tell pretty quickly that good old Eddie locally was not going to be able to take us to the next level and so we we then kind of switched to jh cone which was a player in in the jersey area and then in the last chapter of my career you know I was an early investor in Facebook and Twitter and have built some very big companies and so now I have family office dynamics and everything they're my own internal employees so that's that's my journey nothing too you know very cliche you know but what I think is interesting is I made those decisions not in the world we live in today in fact probably what motivates me so much is I would have been the exact person that would have hired from social media when I was ready to move on from Eddie Halper and my dad this medium didn't exist then but 28 year old me would have found that person in that feed and been like dad I want to work with this person and that's what motivates me so much on the advice I'm giving you today you're welcome yeah let's keep yes sir let's let's extend it as much as we can all right Damie Demetroff, Gary nice to meet you pleasure put questions so our firm requires other firms that's how we've been growing for the last three years one of the things that's most challenging for us you know I'm not a marketer I know post twice at you know yes today yep the one thing is so we bar about three four firms a year yep and we have this issue of how long do we wait to merge the brand and how do we go about merging the brand how would you you know do you have any tennis tricks that you can share? I think first of all I'm excited that you're having that conversation because it is the right conversation you will get economies of scale by creating a macro brand for all these things at some level but to your point some of these brands have a lot more equity locally and if you do a poor job with the macro brand you might actually lose a little momentum right I think there's no tips or tricks I think you know I have a lot of theses on brand first names are made Nike meant nothing to no one until they executed McDonald's sounds like an Irish pub on the corner down the street until it was made something Google meant nothing Facebook meant nothing so I think people overthink brand names right so I think one keep that in mind it's execution that will get you there but I think at some point it is appropriate if you're rolling up all this stuff to get to a macro brand and then the execution meaning the day-to-day content that that brand puts out until you're ready for your brand to put out content every day about the brand I wouldn't be in a rush to consolidate that's really it's not very complicated my friend you got it hey so I'm like attacking full please what's your name one one yeah so you know I think we'd establish that the us of you know goes us in the room or not you know particular experts in you know cutting edge marketing let's say so the question would be how do you evaluate the advisors to help usher us into being more forward-looking in marketing particularly at a time when the technology is balding so rapid then very carefully I it's very hard to judge someone's skill in a craft you don't understand so I will give you this one tidbit the disproportionate most important thing that marketing is living on right now is getting views organically on social media for the first time in marketing history marketers like us can judge if somebody's good at creative by how many views the video or the picture got when it was posted organically let me just this is going to help a lot of you for the first time ever in the 15 years of social media how many followers you have no longer matters as much I've spent 15 years amassing 60 million followers and someone in this room can post the video tomorrow on tiktok and get more views than I get which is insane the merit is on the individual piece of content so the way I would judge is is I wouldn't pay someone to consult I would pay someone to do and I would have them post those videos organically and I would judge them on how many views those videos are getting that is how you judge now you have to be fair to that person if you've never posted before you don't have a baseline so you got to give them 30 days to post and see what those numbers look like or you could look at competitors in the market you can see how many views they're getting because that's how social works the judgment today is based on how many views achieved by the organic the organic you can hide behind spending a thousand dollars on getting views that's not doing anything how many views did the post get organically so I wish we could go all morning but unfortunately I have to wrap it up Gary thank you so much for being here thank you thank you everyone thank you
