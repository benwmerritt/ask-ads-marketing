Most people right now could have a much better life if they could live within their financial means, but they're not willing to sell their home and downsizing their home. They're not willing to take the BMW and bring it back. They're keeping up with the Joneses. I believe the keeping up with the Joneses thing is the great pandemic of our society. I really believe that. Agreed. And it's why I never share any content ever in my career. Never have. That speaks to anything bougie. What are you feeling right now? Like what should I read? I think, well, first of all, you pushed us to tell us that this was going to be a grind. Like you told me it was going to be a grind. Yep. I love grinds. I know you do. I really do. I think it connects to that like athlete in me that just wants to like practice, practice, practice and you know take the reps and do them. Ask me what my favorite thing that I've accomplished in my life is. What is it? Beating Nate Schroeder in tennis twice when he was beating me five to one in a set to six. Twice, Nate. Nate. Twice. It's so great. There's nothing better in life than to come down from five one or five love to win a set. It feels like everything. Yes. Yes. And I know that about you. Yeah. And I told you that's what this was going to be. Yes, and it is. And I didn't I don't think I was surprised by it, but I do think that selling a book is very hard. It's very hard to do. Yeah. No one tells you about the selling the easy part was writing it. Correct. And it was fun coming up with the name. Yes. So we we did this the way we do any company. We went all in. Yes, you did. And full transparency. We sold about 10,000 copies. Yes. Which we're told is good. We think it's not enough. Yep. And we're going to continue to work. We were sitting around this weekend and we said, why aren't we selling this to the real people who need it? And if you are doing a company and you're not willing to go to your local park and ask for the purchase, you don't believe in your company. Yeah. So we grabbed the table, made a sign, went to our park. It was not stage. Who made the sign because I analyzed the sign. I did. I made the sign. Quickly. Quickly on Vista. Yeah, no, I mean, listen, perfect is not what it's about. And by the way, I didn't say I analyzed it poorly. Yeah. And Cass was like, she was laughing, but I was sitting there like, you know, get your free books, get your free advice. You know, people would come up and they're like, who are you? Oh, we've only had about $10 billion. And Max said to me, wait, what the fuck? But here's the crazy part. It was fun. I loved it. We like Mike and I, there was nobody else carried a 40 pound table into Central Park, like 100 yards. Like that's not. That's shoveling shit. It's shoveling shit. Yeah. And so what we've done is we've said, yes, everything. We, you know, podcast. The humble brag of living 100 yards from Central Park, I thought was the best part of that little moment. Keep going. It just happens to be our local park, but it doesn't matter what your park is. Like if your park isn't like Cleveland, go to your park. We happen to have 18 million people come through our park. Yeah. And we basically have just worked and we've, you know, we created a V2 mom, which is vision value methods, obstacles, which we talk about in the book. And we said, we want to be a best seller. How are we going to be a best seller? We got to put in the work. So it's for us, it's speaking, getting on stages, podcast. And most importantly, it's asking people for the purchase. That a lot of people don't ask people to buy whatever that was number one, number one. Yeah. Yeah. And so every person text every single person Anderson to Charlie's house. And what's incredible, you're talking about disappointments. There are people who we made one who we made $80 million, $80 million fucking dollars. Yep. I talk about this all the time. That just said, no, did not buy a book. Said that we don't have a budget for getting really loud. No, no, he's right. I will never forget that. I'll never forget you beating Nate. I'll never forget me beating cast and pickleball. And I'll never forget the people who didn't buy. He's never beaten me in who we did stuff for. And I'm not transactional. You know that we give, give, give. But when I ask and someone says, no, we don't have budget, so frivolous. So and then you have to say, wait, you don't have personal budget for that. That part. So that's the biggest disappointment. You know who your friends write a book and you'll know all your friends in a real way, in a real way, in a real way. And also, you'll know this is the icky part. You'll know who's rooting for you. Yeah. That's the icky part. Yeah. By the way, icky. Yes. I mean, I think, look, I think we're very close in real life, which as you both know, my friend group is quite small. Like it's predominantly family and employees. Yeah. Because employees are family to me. You know, like you guys know that I'm pretty happy. Yeah. And the reason I'm happy is I also take note. I've got some crazy ones on that as well. I told you that was going to happen. Yeah. I reopened a round that was closed for someone that they made that kind of money on. Like it was three months later. So you know how impossible that is. And they bought zero books. And I, I, but I'm happy because I don't have expectations. Like I'm not icked out by it. I feel bad. Honestly, you know what's so weird? I'm so confident. I actually feel bad for people that do that to me because I'm like, that's a mistake. Like, you know, like, I know it's funny. It might not be because I'm such an idiot that I still would probably show up for people that heavily disappointed me because I don't really factor people's actions into my actions. Yeah. I mean, we, we talk about this a lot with our generosity, right? I asked someone the other day, you know, if you, if you're successful, I said this to this one person, do you, do you stop giving back at a certain point? Because we don't. Yeah. And he goes, Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you do a certain point. You just don't look behind you. And I just couldn't get over that because like my actions will never change. Yeah, same. Um, so a lot of people here will buy a lot of people who listen will buy books. There's a very specific reason all these PR people hit me up every day because the sales come from the podcast for the ones that are listening. Break down the different people that should buy this book who are, who's the demo that you think that's listening on the other side are aspiring entrepreneur, active entrepreneur, um, executive, you know, kid hustler, um, 60 year old pondering next chapter, all the above this way, that way, here's how these people should think about it. So yes, yes, and yes, this is 30 years in the making. It's every mistake we made, every painful loss, every lesson, there are 50 cheat codes that we picked up the hard way, not only about the business, but about life, not only about how to build a business, how do you build a life that matters? What's the purpose of being successful if you're miserable? Right. And so if you're an entrepreneur and you don't read this, you're negligent. It gives you every cheat code from how to structure your calendar to how to focus an organization, how to hire well. If you know aspiring entrepreneurs, a lot of people graduating buy it for them. If you're in customer service, you're about to lose your job from AI. Buy the book now because whether you want to be an entrepreneur or not, you're out of work. If you're a salesperson, you're probably going to have to do your own thing at some point. If you're a junior coder, buy this book because it'll help you get up and running. I also think if you're about to buy a company, right, we see a lot of entrepreneurs by acquisition, right? This is the book. This is how you do it. We speak to a lot of kids, you speak to a lot of kids. This is the book to buy. What's not worked that you thought would work selling this book? So we were hopeful that social media would move books. It's created an incredible community. It's not where you sell books. For us, we started at zero. We have built a network which for the first month reached a million people last month. We'd look at that. We thought it was going to drive books. We look at that as just building the relationship. We should have known because we have your book all over the place. Have you made a direct call to action piece of content that you've run media against? Yes. Yes. And so what are you seeing there? Not conversion to sales, but definitely conversion to followers. So we're at the point right now where we have two weeks and we're starting a blitz, which will include many more ads, that we think puts our best ads forward. So everything we do, we're learning from, we have a whole data capability, not just CRM, but who's visited the websites, who's following us, all that stuff. And frankly, we don't think social these days is for selling until you have such a close relationship with these people, which we're starting to feel. We're starting to feel personal relationships like you have felt with people who have supported us, who bought books, who want to get our attention. What's interesting is there have been people who've gone so overboard in supporting us just to get our help, which we probably would have helped anyways. And we're walking at us with probably 100 great friends who we didn't meet before. And people who show up to our Founders Farm, which is our community that we talk to every other week, who are awesome and they're like, we can't wait for this book to come out. We're going to do everything we can to push it. That has been really lovely. Book tour. Book tour. We've done two book parties. We've got another one. Well, you, when it comes out, are you trying to avoid that? It's hard. I don't know if it... This goes back to the reason I'm bringing it up is... I'm going to tell you one thing. Yeah. Go ahead. Because I won't forget my... The name shit has been a problem on the book tour. There's stores in parts of the country that don't want to have you. Yes. And that's been an issue. Which we love. Every time we get rejected. We love that. We love that. We want to product people love or hate. People who love the cover and the... And we can't get Amazon ready for this to allow us to do ads through social because of the name. They won't allow us to do ads. But you could buy a gun on Amazon. That's the crazy part. So like there's been really fucked up shit. You could buy any tests so you want on Amazon. Yeah. I mean, listen, you're talking to somebody who's been fighting the cursing reality for 20 years. It's one of the great silly things in our society. What was it? We wanted to do college. But wait, wait, wait, wait. What's the... And don't be in the college. There was a very prominent entrepreneurship program. Like Babson. Where it's probably as Babson. Where they were very interested because this is their textbook. Thanks Gary. You're welcome. And the only reason they didn't kind of incorporate it into their curriculum was because of... The name. And I said, listen, if your students can't like deal with shit and just saying that, they have no chance as an entrepreneur. Crazy. Crazy shit. Crazy shit. And the guy had one of our really good friends who is a big supporter of Babson. I don't know if he's on a board. Is he on the board there? Maybe. Babson. But he had like 500 to a thousand books lined up for us. And then he gets to the top guy on the board who's just like, no, we can't have anything that would say something like that. I'm like, what? Which says more about institutions today than anything. Anything. Yeah. Of course. And we love Babson. I mean, it's the single best entrepreneurship course. You know, screw that, right? I'm not saying it's Babson. Yeah, no one's saying it's Babson. Yeah, we love Babson. And no one's saying that like entrepreneurship is like sports and you really actually have to do it versus reading about it. You know, no one's saying that. No one is. It's not a book that we could have done like at any time but now. Like we needed time to basically say, OK, here's all of it. I wish we did it earlier. What are you talking about? Maybe a few years earlier, but we had to experience. We didn't have any bandwidth to do it earlier because, you know, you know what the drill is. Of course, especially the kids at your age right now. Bigger kids, bigger problems. 100%. And you also were decompressing from 30 years of running an hamster wheel. Yeah. Like you guys were allowed to like go into that chapter of your career. Plus it also happened during COVID. There were so many things going on. Do you know what I think our biggest regret is? Not keeping up our community right after buddy media. Like we just went silent on social. Basically not listening to you. Yeah. We had dinner right after we sold and you said listen. I love your writing. I was doing a lot of you need to keep doing it. And we're just tired and you know, you can do anything. You just can't do everything. And that's one thing that. Minus you. Yeah. But I think, you know, I think the other thing is that like. I'm sure this book and this adventure for you guys has been really eye opening, especially the way I see you guys connect with people on stage. Like I'm sure it's not lost on you two, especially knowing that your youngest is going to college and fall. You have so many more chapters in front of you. In a way that like knowing you so well. Where I don't have predictions. Like I don't know if you'll start another massive company or continue to just do the investing heavy handed being involved, private equity type stuff. But like you may go all the way to one extreme, all the way to the other extreme. And you'll probably do that multiple times. Like do I think you have three years in front of you six years from now where you're complete you're more checked out than you've ever been. I'm like, yeah, that would make sense because that would mean for the last six years you've been doing this and other stuff. And then do I think after those three years you're like, wait a minute. Like I think and in general the reason I'm probably saying this is I want people on the podcast to hear me out on this. I don't understand this concept that humans think everything is absolute and you can't just adjust. Like I remember my sister really wanting I could feel it through every phone call interaction even though my mom put being a stay at home mom on such a pedestal. That my sister was propagandaed by it. And she could not wait to do it. She was in retail then she was a great teacher. Now she started her family and she was excited for it and living that life. But after about five or six years I could just see it on her face. I'm like and I said to her I was like just like in a kind of like shaking moment of like on the phone with her. I was at the airport. I remember this moment so well. I was like, sis, you're allowed to change your fucking mind. Exactly. Like I get that you've been told and you decided for yourself for 40 years that like for 30 years whatever was at the time like you're going to be this stay at home mom just like mom. You're allowed and watching her go through the process of being a real estate agent and now doing that and now balancing both she's a dramatically happier person. There you go. And like you're allowed back to shoveling shit like everybody's like your business sucks right now and you hate it. Like you're allowed to shut it down or sell it. Yeah. And we I mean a big part of this book is it's miserable and suffering and going through it is difficult and it's awesome. It's like parenting. Yes. It's being able to hold those two things. It's golf and parenting. It's like you have one good shot. It keeps you like golf and I think inside these companies for a lot of people we find our purpose. Right. And we had lost our purpose in many ways. Speak for yourself. I had. You know I was painting. You know this. I was painting. I was a little lost and it took me to say this is what I want to hear from you. You got you fucking enabled it. You got him this his own little apartment in the house painting on the floor. But what happened was I realized that this is what we do and this is why kind of I found my purpose the passion. Yes. I get up. I would get up in the morning when I was painting. I'm like I'm the worst. Like I used to love painting but hobbies are things that you suck but you love. Gary wanted one of the pictures. Yes. You want one of my fucking paintings have a painting but it's. Oh I get I mean I mean I beat myself up. I woke up this morning at 540. I was in Nashville yesterday just to play 6am basketball. It's my hobby. I suck. But you love it. I had a really bad day today. Like I was like two for 18 from the field. Uh oh. Sound like the self. And it was but you know hobbies are you're right. Hobbies are things for a lot of people that you love. That you're not as good at. To your point though why I love entrepreneurship for a lot of us. It's minimally half hobby. Yeah. Yes. That's why it's so great. You know for us I know I can speak for the three of us. Like we really like it. Like we really like it. See I like I like like I said from the beginning I like the grind. I like having a purpose every day. I like it's not that I'm sitting there going oh I have to fill my day with something. You know because I can I you know Mother's Day I spent by myself alone with my dogs. I guess I wasn't alone with the dogs. That's what you wanted. That's what I wanted. Good for you. Silence. And I was out of town. Well I would have asked for it anyways. But but the the purpose the getting out. Or he's got a fish show. No he was playing golf. I was with Cole his 21st birthday. Okay okay. He's playing golf. I was right. Yeah well your son. Right. Yeah I mean don't look. Correct. Don't sandbag him here to the audience. I appreciate that. Here's one of the few people who will actually you know call cast out. No no no. I'm just trying to support you. That was like when you said golf I was pissed. No. And then when you said Cole I was like oh good job. Yeah no we we set up a trip Mike and I for my sister. Do the same thing. She's like this is what I want for Mother's Day. Like you know I love that everyone's like oh I want to be around my kids on Mother's Day. Are you kidding me. It doesn't. Are you kidding me. You know what is funny. I wonder I actually believe that there's a valid point that Mother's Day should be when moms like don't hang out with anybody. There's no reason to be around with the children. There's already a movement around Valentine's Day called Gallantines. It's like screw the husbands just the women go and have fun together right. Oh I love everything about that. Why don't they do Mother's Day like that. Well first of all it's all made up holidays. Let's just go right there. Yeah and by the way like speaking for the fathers. Nobody gives a fuck about Father's Day compared to Mother's Day. Like if you want an indication of where we are in society like dads like somebody throws like some underwear at them at like nine in the morning like dad and then that's like and they're like dad go do some shit like it's like. And we're fine with it. Yeah we're like whatever. And a tie. Like you gotta remember ties. I used to give my dad ties. Back back to the book. It's obviously on the precipitous of being released. But people have read it at this point. Yes. You know because now it's actually exists. Yes. What's the biggest compliment you've gotten from someone who's read it. And what I mean by that is what did they call out that neither of you saw because I think the best and coolest part about writing a book is when you get feedback on it. You've been in it for so long and you think you know everything about it. And then somebody you admire or respect gives you some flowers on a piece of it. And you're like oh fuck I didn't even like what has that happened yet. I know mine. You go first. You go first. You go first. Why cast things at first. I'm trying to think of mine that was. There was a mom who came to the you know one of our meetings we do these zoologists with the Founders Farm and she started crying. And she said for the first time in my life I have given myself grace to realize that it's OK to work hard and slack a little as a mom because she felt that she was an awful mom and not performing at her best at her company. It's an event events company. And the book helped her realize there is no balance. She needs to be you know kind to herself and just realize that she prioritized family and work. She can't do everything perfectly. Every day is a grind. And it was that imbalance life that we captured that has given a lot of people a mirror to say what I am doing is OK. And I'm building a life that I'll be able to sit back maybe later and enjoy some of the spoils but my kids will be OK and the company will be OK. In fact one of the most profound moments of my career happened on a speaking tour in Asia where I had like a VIP event after and it turned into me having to hang with like 2030 very successful people. So it was really fun. Young and this young woman said we got into deep philosophical shit and this young woman said kind of like jam sessions and this young woman said something that I will never forget to the day I die. She said that growing up she really resented her mom. Because her mom was one of the five biggest judges in the Philippines or Singapore I don't recall. And she said she turned 20 and she had this moment of like clarity where she realized yes my mom missed recitals and stuff of that nature. She's like but oh fuck I'm in university with all these girls and I just realized something. My mom showed me how to live. She didn't tell me how to live. And I was hanging out with all these girls that have moms at home who told them what to do but didn't show them what to do. And it crushed me to my core because what people don't tell each other enough is kids. You have three I have two. Kids are all different and they're all going to get different things. You know me and my sister are pretty close in age. The way my sister and I view our childhood what our parents did is different. It's different. Different perspectives. It's different perspectives. And so whether you over coddle under coddle whether you stayed at home or went to work you know like your the reality is you don't know how your kid's going to perceive it. You might be doing a disservice in the thing that you think is servicing them and it's a really interesting game. So you know I was going to get my example was going to be about this other woman who came up to me and again she's just very emotional about you know I just really feel like I'm going to fuck my kids up. Like I am I'm going to fuck them up. And I said well it's not necessarily going to be because you're working. I said you got a whole long list of things that can come before working. In fact there's a lot of parents who saved their kids by working because if they were around too much all that neurotic horseshit that they have would have went on them even more. Yeah the helicopter. I mean that's I'm I'm too. I think us not being around early would have been a good thing. But what she said is you said your kids are okay now. And I said what was interesting is in the last five years I've really realized both Mike and I've realized that you can say whatever you want to kids but it's going to go in and out of their ear. But if you show them right you actually show them how to live how to show up for people. How to have a work ethic. How to have values and morals and do the right thing. That will stay with them. And so she said to me you know I listened to you on stage and you said your kids are all right. And all of a sudden I felt like everything was worth it what I was doing. And specifically like my kids know that working hard is a virtue. Yeah of course. Yeah well it's also something that writing the book we have to take stock of our life. And would you would you I haven't talked about this really anywhere. Oh here we go. But you know right before my bar mitzvah my dad ran into some massive financial issues. Oh where. And he made it clear that he didn't want to live. And I didn't understand it at the time. Of course not. Right because you're young. And it's a relationship that I basically wrote off. We have a relationship but we really don't. You've met my stepfather my mom you haven't met my dad right. That's right. And there's a reason. Writing the book made me realize how difficult companies are on mental health. Especially if you run into major financial issues. Yep. And then those financial issues start impacting your personal relationships. Of course. And I would just encourage everyone who have severed relationships or relationships that aren't great to give a little mercy which I didn't do. But part of writing the book I realized that oh man I learned what I know about mental health from that example right. Exactly. And I need to kind of forgive him before anything which has been a process that I figured out in the book. Yeah. You know it's really powerful what you just hear Mike. It makes me think about the thing that I wish more people could get to which is your dad and so many people today are so worried about what people think about that. Oh yeah. The reason so many people jump out windows when they lose their money in Wall Street is they're not capable of going backwards. And the shame. That part. But where the shame comes from worrying about what people think about them having to go backwards. You know I think about this a lot. I think about this a lot because I've always really almost romanticized going backwards which is super sick. I mean it. I talk a lot in my content about like in the Rocky where he goes back to like the basics. There's just something this is just why I adore my mom so much. There's something in me that like you know if I text you guys I'm like hey just want you to know about some personal matters like I have to sell my apartment like like I don't view that as like like I'm not scared of people being like oh you're a loser or this and that. And I feel like definitely when your dad went through that nobody had the capacity to go backwards and I will say that most people right now could have a much better life if they could live within their financial means but they're not willing to sell their home and downsizing their home. They're not willing to take the BMW and bring it back. They're keeping up with the Joneses. Yeah. I believe the keeping up with the Joneses thing is the great pandemic of our society. I really believe that. Agreed. And it's why I never share any content ever in my career. Never have that speaks to anything bougie. Yeah. You know I don't show the things that my hard work has afforded me because I don't think it brings any value. I do not believe it is aspirational to show someone a private plane or an incredible vacation or diamonds. I believe it's actually hurting people. Yeah. You know I think that that is right and there are a lot of people who are showing it and living in their parent's basement and creating this environment where like it just looks like everyone's crushing it but you pull back the card. Or the parent's basement is not that extreme. They're doing it by maximizing credit cards. Well there you are. By living way above their means. You know it's like it's not you know the reason I'm double clicking on that is I want people to understand especially ones that are doing it right now like you know that that intense story Mike shared that's really on the edges of like how bad it can get but I do believe a lot of people are depressed and unhappy because of this issue. And they're comparing right. Yes. Yes and comparison is the thief of joy. In a way that's crazy you know like you and I the three of us grew up in entrepreneurial times together when you guys had your incredibly massive event with Buddy Media and Salesforce and when I visit you in your very incredible third home outside the U.S. those were joyous moments for you. None of your winning felt like that I wasn't winning. We need to get to that place universally. If we got to that place universally there'd be a very happy world. Big time. Envy and jealousy is foundational to our problems. Yeah. Yep yep yep. I couldn't agree more and. And it's important that you're talking about it. I mean with your platform. I think it really matters. You know I think again we're talking about shoveling we're talking about an entrepreneurial book here but what we're doing for all the entrepreneurs and want to be entrepreneurs and the aspiring entrepreneurs is we're talking about the only thing that has ever made anyone achieve entrepreneur success mental strength. This is the hardest game. There's a reason there's so few of us. There's a reason there are so few of us who literally live their full life. With 100% of the financial responsibility on their neck. Yeah yeah. And only that you're when you start a company you are agreeing to let people see you fail in public. Front row seat. And I remember at Buddy Media at the end we'd raise a hundred million dollars and one night I turned the cast I'm like this doesn't work out we're fucking dead like we're done forever. Because we respect real. Yeah. I mean at the end of the day I think we're real entrepreneurs but real entrepreneurs are ones that grow the business without venture capital right venture capital provides a safety net and I say this all the time we're just on a podcast who's your favorite entrepreneur I said Gary because he doesn't raise money and by the time he does there's a reason right yeah and I think that that kind of hustle of like how do you get customers on board how do you get cash flow to grow the business. Well that's what makes selling books so interesting for you guys right because it's a different game it's a it's a different transaction. We were OK going to zero and starting again and we what's weird is maybe we're sick fox I don't know but we fantasize all the time about maybe we were happier when we were like poor that I'm like no we weren't like we couldn't afford health care we couldn't. Well but you know what you weren't poor in the in like you're obviously in a very different financial stratosphere you were happy because with golf.com with Buddy Media you were building. The reason you guys are alive in a different way. We're builders. You're builders. Yes. Like that's that's the part. Yeah you're not custodians. Right. And not renters. That's where I have to say if if I'm being totally honest I didn't love the V being a V.C. because I'm a builder and I didn't think it it it. When you're a V.C. you're a fan. Yes and I didn't feel close. You're not like hands on the field. Yeah. You're a fan. Yeah I'm just you know your supporter. Yeah. Like I'm going to go to the garden tonight and I'm like I want the next to win so bad. We see you. But like but I'm going to cheer. Yes. And like that's kind of no different than when I write a 50,000 hour check to a startup. But like I'm like I'm cheering from the side. You know I'm cheering. Yeah and and. That's why we're not raising another V.C. fund. Good for you. We will be launching businesses. That's really cool. We're launching 10 pizza places. Cass doesn't know about this yet. But we love pizza. Everyone loves pizza. And and we're buying companies. That yeah. We've bought you know healthcare staffing. When you took that one. Yeah. Like when you guys again. We love that. I know it's where I'm about to go with the podcast. Taking the curtain away. When you guys and I talk in real life. And you bring up that thing. You bring up that thing in a different way than you do other stuff. Yes. You feel better about it. Yes. You like it more. Totally. You're in deeper. Yeah. We can build culture. We can. One of the first things we did is do a profit sharing plan. Yeah. So company's been around for 25 years. Incredibly profitable. They'd never felt. Success. And so it's how do you how do we run our playbook of like it's your playbook. Empathy and passion. We share that work and accountability. And leading by example. And when you own more than 50 percent. You can do it. You be the boss. You have to be a benevolent dictator. Yeah. But you like the barn owl and be friends. Yes. Or the possum. You were possum for you today. I love it. Well listen. Shoveling shit. You can find it everywhere. Books are sold by the time you listen to this. But I think we go to Amazon and hit it hard to get that rank up. I do say this often. But I think a lot of you know this. Cass and Mike are truly family to me. And so if you can support this book. If you if you run an entrepreneur school or or or a hub. You know I'm looking for dozens and and fives and sevens. And we got four kids that all are entrepreneurial. One for each support this book. I really believe they put their soul into it. Which makes it so valuable. The way books are priced. I just find this so valuable. And so my cast thank you so much. Thanks for having us Gary. Love you. you
