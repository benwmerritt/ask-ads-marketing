Actually, I believe that people will marry AI robots that look like humans within the century. For sure. Nobody's gonna use Google anymore. Feels like the yellow pages are ready. Already, already. People like me being able to build an app in one day that used to cost like a trillion. AI athletes, the robots are close. I think that there'll be sports leagues. I think that AI robots can change the entire complexity of sports. I think there's a better NFL at NBA with AI robots as athletes, I think that's possible. AI army is here, AI police. It's about to really hit the fan. What do you think realistically, 10 years from now, what do you think AI looks like in our everyday life? In a way that would make every person in this room very uncomfortable. It's big, big. It's the biggest thing that's happened since the internet. I think that if I wanted to compete with you on your content, I can create a human AI and write the copy and if I'm better at content, I can compete with you even though I don't have the visual. I think that AI is gonna reorder all of our clothes, all of our food, everything will become passive. We won't have to think about things that you would never, I think internet of things and AI, meaning your shirt will know when the button's starting to get, literally your shirt will know when it's starting to wear and tear and reorder itself for you. Yeah, I got pitched the other day on an AI influencer that could model me and basically just create all the content. It looks just like me. Of course. Yeah, and I promise you, because I'm looking at all that stuff, that shit's not there there yet. Whenever you look at it, it's not there there, but I promise you in seven years it will be. It is crazy. It's big, it's big and it's resetting everything. You think we'll be walking down New York streets and we won't be able to tell if someone's an AI human or a regular human? In our lifetime, probably. I'd like to live another 50 years, probably brother. Did you see the clip of the AI robot woman where the guy was grabbing her waist and she reacted to the way he was touching her? I just saw that yesterday, straight up. The female AI robot, the gentleman was like, put his hands on her waist and she reacted to it. That's incredible. What? Yeah, man, I think it's a whole new world order, just like the internet was. The internet changed everything. You know that, right? Everything, so yeah, Hollywood music, videos of you and I saying things we never said. They won't be able to tell if it's true or not. I mean, I don't know. Vince Lombardi could come back to life. Could you imagine that? Let's go into your world. The family of Vince Lombardi, if they own the name of your likeness, an AI robot that is Vince Lombardi uploaded in the AI as everything Vince Lombardi has ever said publicly and trained to now act in today's world, is Vince Lombardi coming back? Is Walt Disney coming back? I mean, these are, and again, for everybody who's listening, I'm not an advocate of this. I'm not an advocate of this. I'm just pondering. And I'm pondering things that I think people are not spending a lot of time thinking about. AI's big. What's the number one way that whether your employees, people watching this that should implement AI right now, tactical advice in their life? They should have an AI agent, you know, app, chat, GPT, Proplexity, Gemini, something like that. And they should be using it every day. And they should be asking it what AI other apps should they be using, and they should download it and use it. Anybody who's under the age of 30 that's watching this right now, under 35, who's not using AI for an hour a day, and in my opinion, if you wanna be advanced, not using AI to ask about what other AI's they should be using, is make a huge fucking mistake. When you evaluate businesses, entrepreneurs, top 1% of entrepreneurs out there, what are the things that identify this is gonna be an elite operator to you? Obviously the first one's very easy, which is have they done it before, and let me analyze it. If it's a first time person, you're purely guessing, you spend an hour or two time together, and you try to ask those questions, you try to get a sense of her, his, fire in the eye. You know, I've been right a lot, Zucks, had Williams with Twitter, was the reason more than Jack Dorsey for me, though Jack was a beast. I think like animals, like you can sniff your own, because I know what I am, I can sense it on others, and different levels to it, and so that's what I look for. When people talk about Gary V, I feel like you're synonymous with hustle culture, and grinding, and sacrifice, and to get where you want it, but as you've gotten older, what have you learned about balance, and how, and the impact it has on you? You know, it's funny, you know, honestly, if you go read, if you go look at my content in 2009, 10, 11, 12, I think people like when I scream about that stuff, but like, I don't know, like there's a lot of people that make fun of me of like being too foofy, like, I don't know, I've been balanced, like I don't know, I've slept seven, eight hours a night my whole career, I check the fuck out anytime I feel like I want to, I take seven weeks of vacation, I just go super hard when I'm awake, like, and by the way, who gets to decide balance? Me? You? God? Like, who's in charge about, like, actually, here's a good question, no bullsh, how old are you? Third. And you're single? Girlfriend. Girlfriend. No children. No children. Real talk, for fun, because I think this will be helpful for your audience. What do you feel balances for you, work-wise, at this point in your life? I want you to define balance in hours of working in a week. I'd say if I can be 50, 60 hours a week, yep. I'd say if I can be done working at like seven o'clock. Nice. And when do you start? Nine. Nine, yeah. And that's five days a week, right? I think nine to seven, Monday through Thursday for sure, I don't know how you deal with your Friday, like if that gets a five versus a seven, yeah, right, life events with a girlfriend, like, I don't know. I mean, that feels, to me, that feels light, for me, by the chemicals in my body, not ultralight, just a tad light, for me. By the way, for a lot of people watching, that felt too much. They're like, what are you doing? Like, you're gonna regret that you're, you know, they think you should be nine to five, maybe even nine to five, Monday through Thursday. I don't think I'm right. I definitely don't think they're right. I think you're right for you. And I think that's awesome. I don't know like who gets to decide, does your girlfriend think you're balanced, or does she think you work a little too much? She knows I work a lot, but understands. And I think the difference too is like, to me, that is what I would identify as balanced, but I'm in a phase in my life where I don't need to be balanced right now. I'm built, you know, so that's like. No shit, why do you think I feel it's light? That's my point of view. But I don't think I get to be right on you. I don't think I'm like, I also don't know you well enough to know how big your ambitions are. How big are your ambitions? Pretty big. Meaning, give me something. I wanna build a 100 plus million dollar media company. Nine to seven, Monday through Friday, might be a hairlight. Are you super checked out on the weekends, or are you in it? I'm working more than that. I would say that's what I would identify as me being balanced. I am not balanced. Respect. Respect. I'm saying that if I wanted to be balanced, I'd be nine to seven, but I'm working weekends, I'm working. Heard. Heard. Makes sense. You're trying to build a hundred million dollar thing. Fuck man, I respect that. Got it. Note now, I would say, it's funny, you and I are similar. I would say Monday through Friday, nine to seven is balanced to me too. To me, that's the watermark if you're trying to be upper middle class of the world. I don't mean upper. Just if you wanna build something, if you're doing something, as an employee, where you've got a country club person, and you have a second home, and you have a pool, work is a thing. But by the way, I'm also very big believer that the people that go nine to four, the French movement, I actually, people are stunned when I talk about this in detail. I'm good for you. You don't think I can feel in my body what it would feel like to be a nine to four guy with a one hour lunch, and enjoy the shit out of that? I was lazy at school. I didn't do shit in college. I know what the leisure life feels like. It's good. I just like what I do too much. To me, this is playing a sport every day. It's like playing a game. For me, I agree, but I don't think a lot of people would agree with us that nine to seven Monday through Friday is balanced. I think most people think nine to five, and to be frank, I think with post-COVID, a lot of people even think I have day Friday in there, I work from home, or you're actually working three hours. And by the way, again, I will say this, I just want incredible clarity, good for them. The only thing that I say to a lot of them is like, when you go to the gym, if you do a real workout for an hour proper, seven days a week, including in those seven days, two days are scratching, like the right shit. And I go to the gym and I lally gag three days a week. We shouldn't have the same muscles. And that's how work is. So if you're gonna go for leisure, shut your fucking mouth about what you feel like you're entitled to, because that's just how life works. And I know a lot of people were mommy and daddy real nice, but that's not it. I'm a big believer in life. Life's all about momentum, especially in business and sports. I'm a big momentum guy too. And once you have momentum, you have everything to keep it, and as soon as you lose it, you gotta get it back as fast as possible. Are there any moments where you've lost momentum? Yes. I gotta get it back. Yeah, I lost momentum at 28, because I think I went through a period where I fell in love and I mean, this was in work. I mean, in life, it was great falling in love, that's great. But I was starting to build a little resentment towards my dad, right? Because as you can imagine, as I started to become into another relationship with like, I'm gonna build my own family, kind of all that, you know, I built a business from three to 60 million and made nothing, nothing, nothing. And I worked 100 hours a week, actually. You know, nine to 10, Monday through Saturday, 12 to five, Sunday, real talk. So you can imagine when people are like, I'm like, oh, hey. You know, like, I feel like I lost momentum on the Gary V brand last year. I was so head down building VaynerX and V Friends. In fact, why I'm even doing this is I'm starting to get back out there. So that's been fun. Like, I like losing momentum, because I like the restart. I don't beat myself up when I've been like, eating well and working out well and then have a bad four months. I'm not like, oh, I fucking blew it. Four years for, like, people do that shit. I'm like, no, no, no. Like, I can get this back. And I like that challenge. I feel like I see and feel like direct correlation between when I'm popping off the most on content, the business things, the opportunities, the money make opportunities, they start to just come out. Well, why the fuck do you think I've been yelling about it for 15 years? But when you say you've lost momentum on the Gary V brand, do you feel the impact of that on other businesses? No, because there's a different version of Gary V. There's the operator. Right, so like in a lot of ways, I feel the momentum of it because I was head down making the businesses sound, staffing, restructure I just met, right? So yeah, by the way, I do feel it. Like less speaking opportunities. Like if I'm, like anybody who's out of the attention graph is gonna have less things. I feel it, I feel it. But it's so easy to get back if you're good at it. Again, like a great app. Like I don't love the gym, but like someone who's actually in shape and like always, like again, you look, actually, you've probably gone through this journey in a real way between 22 and 30, right? You've probably had ebbs and, but when you decide to fucking crank it, it doesn't take long for you to get there. Because you got the foundation. Same with me. I got the Gary V foundation. I go do six podcasts and three shows and decide to like vlog for a week and I'm fucking way back. I'm fucking Kai Sonat, you know? So I can get real back real fast. When was the first moment you realized you were rich? When I made $100,000. Felt like it was a ton of money. Yeah, that was my number when I was 14, 15. I grew up in the 80s, 90s. In the 80s, 90s, a million was like fucking way out there. 100,000 was the way the kids now think a million. And now I hear kids like actually thinking it's more than that. Like I love when I see these clips like, oh man, if I don't make 10 million, I'm poor. I'm like, you guys are so fucked. Like this, you know, the youth, you know, there's so many ninjas in the youth. I always love when people like Gen Z, so this. I'm like, man, I know unlimited Gen Zers that are working their fucking faces off, fucking gangsters, emotionally strong, all that. But inflation and just like all the content that pounds kids, like we used to have MTV Cribs and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, but like the level of materialism, like the fact that young men feel like they need a Lambo and a watch is really fucking us up. I mean it, it's really fucking it up. I say it crudely, but it's actually quite profound. Like every human, you know, when you're a male, you hunt. Like you, you're looking for either love or you're looking for a good time, but you're on the offense. And if you feel like you can't unless you have money, which is what this generation now feels in a way that hasn't been historically true, it's just led into like, and then that leads to people fucking taking shortcuts and trying to get money fast and like, they don't get it. I wish like every 23 year old dude knew, 25 year old dude knew like, you can get those pretty girls at 35, 40 and 50 easy. Like slow it down, do it right. It's too bad. Are you more aggressive or more conservative with your money now than you were maybe five, 10 years ago? I've always been overly aggressive. I'm not really using money to amass money. I'm not trying to amass money. Even though I had this great dream of buying the Jets, it's a little bit of like a fun thing more than like my actual like obsession. My obsession is to love my life. And if I get much more joy out of investing in a high risk startup, then I do in a safe real estate play because I'm not trying to maximize money. I'm trying to maximize joy. And I think too many people don't do that. And so I wouldn't call it gambling, but I would call it high risk investing and adventures. And I feel like when I'm 90, I'll be happy with the way I did it because I'll have plenty. My grandkids will have plenty. And I'll be happy that I played, that I tried V-Friends, that I invested in all these companies that went to zero and can have the worst stories. Like, and listen, a lot of people enjoy building huge empires around finance and real estate. And that's awesome. And I cheer for them. For me, I'm more creative and more looking for that thrill. We're at VaynerMedia headquarters, VaynerX headquarters. Just think about how much you've built in your career. What's the most defining moment of that journey so far? Is it one moment that you said, that wouldn't happen, we wouldn't be here? There's a lot of those. When I think about defining moments, I don't, thank you so much. I don't think of it from a standpoint of like, oh, like this day that I just, this moment when I went on YouTube and started the wine show, when Google bought YouTube for $1.7 billion, which at the time, to give you all context, would feel like a $500 billion exit today. Like just to give you inflation and just like, like no one could believe this number. I remember promising myself, that was a defining moment, even though it kind of didn't involve me at all. I promised myself that the next time I would see something big that I would invest in it, not just use it. Cause I was right about email, I was right about dot com, I was right about search, I was right about YouTube, Myspace, and so I saw Twitter and I invested in it. And I would say that in a lot of ways, that moment was defining. But I would say that that's kind of like my fake answer, meaning that's the right kind of answer in the context that I think you asked it. I think the defining moment probably for me in my career was calling my mom in college, freshman year, and crying to her that I didn't want to go into, since I was 14, I said I'm gonna go into the family business and blow it up. And then at my freshman year of college, I had this, I've never really shared this story, so I'm giving you some alpha. I kind of had this moment where I was like, damn, like I know I can do my own thing, like am I willing to pay this sacrifice? Cause it's not gonna be my own thing. And even at that age, even though I've always been confident, there was a part of me that said, well will people be like, even though I'm, I know I'm gonna build this business for my dad, but I never get to get my own credit. You know what I mean? And so that conversation I think, when you asked it popped in my head, I have a very unique career. I spent every day of my life from 22 to 34 building a huge business for my dad and left it with nothing. That's weird. Like I don't see that story out there. I see a lot of immigrants just stay in their family business and eventually inherit it. So there's a lot of moments like showing up on Dignation when that was like the biggest internet show in 2007. Put me on the Twitter map, the Conan O'Brien appearance. I was kind of one of the first internet people to make it to like television. AJ walking into my office and saying he's quitting. When I always thought he would be the one that would run this and I would go on to do something, which led to VaynerSports. And there's so many, brother. When you were in your family liquor business, did you know that when you left this start growing business, it was going to be an agency that whole time or you were gonna be in a media space or that came from your kind of exposure? I had no idea when I would leave. Yeah. You know, probably 1% of me didn't even know if I would leave. I knew my brother was growing up in a manner where he did not have the same level of relationship with my dad. I knew that he didn't wanna be in the business. I knew I wanted to be in business with him. He was 11 years younger. So 29 was, you know, a watershed moment 30 and then ultimately 33, like really, because that's when he was actually done with school. That's when we started Vayner. No, I didn't know what it would be. Like, I just, I mean, I never even thought I would be known. You know, unlike being an athlete where like, you and your, like when you were growing up being this great athlete, you knew there was a potential that if you achieved your dreams, that you would be known. I wanted to be a businessman in the 80s and 90s. None of them were known. The world was so different for the kids under 35. You can't even comprehend what like life was pre-internet. Everything was 100% different. Like in a way that you can understand. Like in a way that AI is about to teach all of you. Like in 15 years you'll be like, how did we live in a world without AI? So no, I had no clue what I was gonna do. But I really didn't think about it again after that phone call when I was 18 until I was about 28 when I had, you know, my first marriage and like, I was like, oh, I'm a grown up now. And like, I have another family to take care of. And I realized I had no value. Like meaning like when I went to go get an apartment, they were like, yeah, we're not giving you a loan. I'm like, but I built my library from three to 60 million. They're like, that's nice. Your dad owns that. You own nothing. And that was like a, that was a watershed moment where I was like, fuck, you know, I was so obsessed brother. You know, like the athletes that actually make it to the league, there's an obsession. I was obsessed with building a business for my parents. Nothing else mattered. Not my life, not my, I'm being serious. Not like friends, not like my own joy. I got into this really cool place where like, I just super appreciated what my parents had done for me. And I thought I was super talented and I believe in the shit that I pumped to all you kids. Like I believe in patients. I didn't think like if I gave up my 20s that I was ruined and I, you know, and I took a lot of judgment, you know, like my high school buddies coming to the liquor store when I was 25 and like, I don't know, you work for your dad. Like they're all making some money. They're all starting to make a little money. They're all kind of like looking down at me. Like I'm the help at my dad's store. But I had like a real vision and a real game plan. When you think about the first couple of years of VaynerMedia when you and AJ started it, what's the biggest lesson you learned during that time? That I was unstoppable. I'm being dead serious. The first two years I was barely involved in the business and we did 1.7 million in revenue. In the first year I ran it, we did 11, the next year we did 27. I'd done it at Wine Library. But to do it again, I was like, okay. Like honestly, I know that's like a weird answer and I kind of keep it humble, but like I feel comfortable giving you the truth. What did I learn in the first couple of years? That I was that guy. That like whatever the fuck I was gonna do, it was always gonna work. I knew nothing about advertising industry. I knew everything about advertising, but not about the industry, not about Madison Avenue. That is no question those first couple of years, especially 2011, 12 when I became the CEO, instead of like still doing Wine Library, still starting to build Gary Vee and working with AJ. That was it. I was like, you know, like anything when you do something great or good, when you do it a second time, you're like, okay, this is not luck, this is not serendipity. And now I was doing it starting it from scratch. So even that level of doubt, like can I do it from zero to three was put to bed. What was the process like of getting those first few major clients at Vana? Were you like hand to hand combat? Yeah, hand to hand combat, yes. I had customers from Wine Library who were buying expensive wine. I'm like, you're rich, do you have marketing needs? It was kind of like that. I was already known for marketing Wine Library. Like the way I became liquor store industry famous was I was the most progressive marketer. I had the first website, I did email first, I did YouTube show. So, you know, just hand to hand combat, serendipity, relationships, drinking wine, networking, emailing people, straight hustle grind. If you could go back right now and give yourself advice on those first couple years, know what you know now, what would it be? It's a more macro answer. I would tell myself that what you've done poorly at Wine Library is what you're gonna do poorly at Vayner. And the sooner you fix it, you'll be better. And that is you need to be able to deliver bad news to employees you like. I was not candorous enough in the first 20 years of my career. What would end up happening is people would be surprised when they got fired. My greatest joy, the thing I'm most proud of is that I'm big on eliminating fear. And it's like, why we have such a good culture? People are not scared. But having that day when I realized that people not knowing if they were gonna get fired at the senior levels actually led to fear was one of the most humbling days of my life. Truly, brother. Like one of the most humbling days of my life where I was like, fuck, you take so much pride in this. And one of your flaws and your personality is actually creating this. So I would tell that person, like get your candor game up. Your greatest candor is Gary V. I shoot it straight as fuck in this environment on stage. Every piece of content all of you have seen, I fucking crush. In real life, Gary Vaynerchuk, if he likes you, which I like everybody, like the more you've been around, I struggle with that. How'd you change? How'd you become more candor? You just started being more honest. Professionally and personally, I realized that candor was leading to all the things that made me sad and all my unhappiness and all my negativity and all the things that weren't working for me. And I decided to fucking change it. Like the same way I decided to change my health. At 38, I was like, okay, this is gonna lead to like death. And like, let's get to the gym and let's eat better. And that doesn't come natural to me as I'm not as bored as being candorous, but I put in the reps and I work and I practice. And by the way, I put myself on blast. I put it out on here. What I'm doing right now is suffocating me. You know? Yeah, so you've no choice. You gotta do it. Yeah, I think a big way to change everything in your life is to tell everybody around you and anybody that's willing to listen, your shortcomings. That will put you in the corner, in a real way. And that's the operation here at VaynerX. I'm fascinated by how you've structured everything, how you have, you know, we walk through here, you have every kind of, every wing of this place is a different entity or different this operation. Can you give me the breakdown of VaynerX, the businesses underneath it, and kind of how you decide what falls under VaynerX, what falls outside of VaynerX, the Holy Co, like Vayner Sports, from what I understand, right? And VaynerWatt, which is a TV production company. Vayner Sports was necessity. The only investor and partner I have in VaynerX is Steven Ross. He owns the Miami Dolphins. When you own a football team, you can't own a piece of an agency. So Vayner Sports would have been inside of VaynerX, had it not been that situation. Under VaynerX is VaynerMedia, which is the mothership. Then there's something called Gallery Media Group, which owns PureWow.com, which is a women's and covator, which is like women's lifestyle magazines on the internet experiential agency. Stuff work in there, but it's a publisher. Kind of like Kandey Nest, Hearst, just smaller. VaynerSpeakers, our speaking bureau sits under there. VaynerCommerce, which is an e-commerce specialty agency. The Sasha Group, which is an agency that originally, why it's named after my father Sasha, was intended to service small businesses. Now it's just become another VaynerMedia. In fact, I'm contemplating a name change. It's become another VaynerMedia. So VaynerCommerce, the Sasha Group, and then there's Ting Lee Lane, which is a barter media company, where you take assets and you turn into media. Even Nose-A-Dom, which is Madison Ave. spelled backwards, which is a, thank you, which is a production company. They all sit under VaynerX. Then there's VaynerSports and VaynerWatt, which is a TV production company, where Steven actually, Ross is my partner in it, because we blend a little bit, but it's not in, because Eric Wattenberg needed equity, it sits outside. Then there's VCR Group, my great club downtown, the Flyfish Club and Little Maven, and Eto and all our restaurants. So that's a restaurant group. I'm the V in VCR, that sits outside of VaynerX. V Friends sits outside of VaynerX. My pickleball team, the fives, is another big part of my life. In Major League Pickleball, that sits out of it, and then all my investing sits out of it. So when you think about a new business vertical, you have kind of spun up a different business for that underneath the holico, as opposed to kind of just keeping all under the VaynerMedia brand. Yeah, I think there's times. I debate it all the time, should I consolidate in, should I spin out? There's just times where things make sense sitting in. We had an innovation company called Vayner3, did NFT work, blockchain, AI, but we spun that back into Sasha and VaynerMedia, because we thought it was core. Yeah, I mean, I think different times, sometimes it's because of executives. If you have somebody super talented that you think can run something, that's what Vayner3 was with Avery, who's our CMO now. So I move, I hate Bill Belichick so much, so I hate using this analogy, but I remember when Bill Belichick took wide receiver Troy Brown, and converted him late, late, late in his career to play some plays in the secondary. I just remember thinking like, fuck, that's so smart. You know what I mean? Like, if you can, why not? And so I do that with executives. Like I definitely do not textbook stuff by reverse engineering. I assume in that scenario, Troy Brown showed Bill things in practice or in film work that he could do it. I look at the same way. Like if I think someone could do it, I'm willing to contemplate it, even though the world doesn't think that's like the way you do it. One of the things I'm curious about it, you mentioned the executive piece. One of the biggest roles you have is hiring, is identifying talent, right? Yeah. What's the best hire you've made in the last couple of years? That's a great question. What's the best hire I've made in the last couple of years? I can tell you that the best restructure I've done is putting JT, John Torrena and Marcus Crizac to my former chief of staff to run the international. I made a real switch to create president roles inside of VaynerMedia that has really worked. I elevated Kaylin McNamara from account to new business and now she's our chief business officer. I think Avery into the CMO role has been very effective instead of like running Latam. So I made a lot of switches that I'm really happy with. Hires, net new. Grace, our creative lead in Canada, good hire for sure. Jesse, her boss who runs the Canadian office, good hire. Casey, Karen, she runs Australia, good hire. Oh, Victoria, my head admin was a great hire. Really has shaped up that universe for me in a great way. What do you look for with your hiring people? What tells you ahead of time that I think they're gonna be a good fit? A mix of like, do I think they're nice? Like I really struggle with people that are overly political. I look for my intuition on are they nice? Are they confident? Because if you're insecure, many people are nice, but they're insecure, which then creates political behavior. Are they capable? Like do I subjectively guessing that I think they're capable of doing the job? Do I believe they have a solid work ethic? I don't expect people to work like me, but like if you're jonesing in your seat at 430 and can't wait to like punch out at five, like that's not it. Do they understand if they get in here, it could be the beginning of like a 40 year career in 10 different companies and that I create lanes from, I was a DNF student, I was a kid from the muck. Like I don't care, I don't even know, do you know I have no clue what college any of my plays have gone to? Outside of their big sports, like I know Ross went to LSU because he fucking wears an LSU jacket every day, but like if you told me, give me $43 trillion to tell me right now where Mike went to college, I have no, did you go to college? Yeah, like no clue, no clue. So I'm not really looking at resume shit, I'm looking at the conversation and do I feel good about them? To be able to do a lot of different things, it sounds like you've built some really unique like admin support to handle. I mean, even just scheduling this where assistants and chief of staffs in different, that's supportive. What's that look like? It's a pretty big operation. Yeah, I have three full-time admins or two full-time admins and two chief of staffs, one's the head of the admins and then Hannah. So I have four full-time people just on my logistics. Yeah, I mean it's four full-time people who like really work, no nine to five life. So yeah, and then we're using AI more and more to be more efficient. Every minute counts. The big part of my content in this podcast, I interviewed a lot of head football coaches around the country and big football audience. College sports has gotten so crazy. If you were a college football head coach right now, what would you be doing to build your program spread? I would be making content. I would be making content about the people around the organization. And honestly, I would build a reputation of what we've been talking about here, which is a lot of coaches pander to talent and lose the team. I have a lot of thoughts on coaching. It's very much like building a big business. My number one piece of, forget about fucking marketing, my number one piece of advice for the coaches here is bench your best player if he's a fucking idiot. People are like too many, like I talk to these kids. We obviously have a sports agency, plus NIL, like we're deep. These coaches, a lot of them have become too similar to modern parents. They're over-coddling their best players. Because they're further in transfer. You got it. The problem is, and I get it, the counter a coach would be like, that's cute Gary, but talent matters. Like no shit, recruit better on talent that can accept a benching. Now again, then they would counter and be like, hey Gary, that's cute, but these are 18 year old kids. I'm like fair. But like create some fucking resemblance of, when the inmates run the asylum, it's game over. And so shit, if there's a transfer portal, let's get into trading. If I was a coach, Michigan State, I was using that random, and my best player is a bozo, I'm gonna fucking trade him to Arkansas State. I think that, and then to attract the talent, I would be in the trenches. I told Jordan Schultz, they'd be right, like a long time ago, like get in the DMs early. And that's really worked for him. I think coaches should start building relationships with kids younger, and social media is the platform. There's a bunch of players now in college football that are making, even in high school now, making $400,000 to go to school, you get quarterbacks making millions of dollars before they get to college. What's some, I say this in the context that, I've seen hype and money kill talent a lot of times. They can kill. Yeah, money, money, money exposes who you actually are. That kid would have lost anyway. Money just accelerates the truth. There's plenty of kids that got a lot of money who are gonna go on to be NFL Hall of Famers. So I think that's truth, but I think that that's what happens there. But go ahead, you were gonna say? Well, I was gonna say, what advice would you have for a young kid who is 17 years old, comes across all this money, now still has to go perform and all the dynamics of, in recruiting, every coach is telling you how amazing you are, and that you're gonna save their program, your best thing since sliced bread. And I think it's an interesting dynamic now when you throw all the money into the fold. You know, I mean, look, this is some real fucking talk. The first thing I would say is, tune your parents out. For 90, you know this, for 95% of them, tune your fucking parents out. The parents are the problem. Not the coaches in the program. Mommy and daddy get in your pockets. And by the way, you're talking to a kid who is obsessed to make mommy and daddy money because he loved them so much. So I also know there's a ton of kids right now like, fuck you, Gary. My single dad, my single mom, my grandma, like, I gotta put, and I'm like, of course, that's not what I'm saying. Take care of your fam, but pay attention to what you want. Like, and do you want this, my big thing with these kids is like, are you okay if this is your last bag? Because as you know, for a lot of them, it will be their last bag. Cause they won't go to the next level. They won't transfer portal because they'll fuck up everything between their senior year and their freshman year. Right? We've seen it. You and I have both seen it. So, you know, I would say to tune the noise out, including your parents, do the right things by the people who deserve it around you. You know, this is a tough one for a 17, 18 year old kid. Don't use money to fix fractured relationships. I see a lot of these. A lot of friendships. Yeah, I see a lot of these kids use it to, if it's something as silly as like a former girlfriend or if it's something as real as a mom and dad kind of abandoned them and they're kind of, that dynamic is like, be thoughtful, get into your therapy mindset, get into your positive thinking, get into your grounded, get into your, this right here, what I just did, I can't hear you by the way, this right here, what I just did, is the single best move a young kid with, that gets money can get. And by the way, that same shit's gonna help you when you're in a big house and 100,000 people are booing you. And that shit that I just did is gonna be the same thing when fucking an analyst says you suck and that shit's gonna work for you when Mel Kuiper says, going into the draft, that you're not gonna translate to the next level and that shit's gonna matter when you start mini camp, your rookie year in the NFL and you realize you're playing with men now and you ain't ready for this shit and that shit's gonna matter when you find you're 23 and you got drafted by the giants and you fucking are out in this city and those 30 year old girls are all up in your money and they just want your fucking money and like that shit, this, it's the most important thing a fucking human could ever do. Last question. Please. You can leave your kids one piece of advice. What would it be? God, there's so many things I like. Here's what just ran through my mind to give you the real answer. I was gonna go back to this because that leads to happiness. I was gonna say to leave more than they take, I think when you're giving more than you're taking, it also leads to a lot of success. And then finally, like, you have to live your passion. You have to. I don't care how much money you make or don't make left, right, center. If you don't like what you do every day, stay at home dad, stay at home mom, sportscaster, cook, chef. Like if you don't like it, it eats up. Besides sleeping, it's what you do. It's life. I don't understand how people don't get this. You have to do something you like, otherwise you'll be unhappy. Appreciate it. Thanks man. Awesome, thanks so much. Thanks so much. Thanks.
