So what do you think the future is of advertising influencers, between influencers coming in, what recommendations do you have for young influencers in their different markets? I think influencer marketing is gonna have an incredible golden year of a decade. I think we're in the beginning of it and I'm very fond of it. I think it's under priced. I think the top is over priced. So the people that moved quickest and have big audiences I think are over priced because people think they're more valuable than they are.

I think it's underpriced right now. I also see because it's human beings, a scenario where in two or three years it's gonna be grossly overpriced. You just have to follow the market. Right now it's underpriced. Right.
