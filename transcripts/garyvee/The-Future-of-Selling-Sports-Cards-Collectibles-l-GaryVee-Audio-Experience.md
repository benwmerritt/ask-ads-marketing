## Transcript
If this market existed when I was 15 years old, I would have never graduated high school. No shot in fucking hell, put the flag in the ground, I'll show you my fucking bullshit report card it's somewhere here, zero chance. So to your point, I can't even imagine what you and others are gonna be doing over the next couple of years to make it even less friction. VaynerNation, very exciting for me to be putting out this podcast, cause there's like a hundred things that are gonna bring value to everybody in this podcast. First, even how it happened. We've got an incredible company to talk to you about. The Sports Card National is coming up. Go Google the National Sports Card Convention, go get a ticket, come by. VFriends has a big activation, I'll be there all week. I'm impossible to find cause I'm usually in my office and traveling and this is always one of the ways to get a quick selfie or a quick conversation. So I'll be there. We're gonna talk about mascot, we'll get into that in a minute. We're gonna talk about the overall card market which I haven't done in a while. Which is really fun for me cause I've been quietly buying as Ripsnose, I bought two very significant Aaron Rodgers rookie cards which is also exciting cause Jets training camp has started and boy am I more excited than I realized. I've got a lot going on in my life these days so I've been a little more distracted than my normal insanity but like the Jets reported the camp and I'm all fired up. So this should be a super fun episode especially for a lot of you are starting to actually collect VFriends collectible cards which is like a whole to do which we'll probably touch on for a few minutes since we got Rips. But more importantly, why I'm excited to have mascot here and I'll let Ezra really explain it, we'll go deep into it up front is in 2018 when I started making sports card content, it was not only did I say, huh, I think this could be like sneakers and I think that ended up being very real, I really nailed that, I think I get a lot of credit for that but it was also like man there's a lot of opportunity for like innovation, like the tech in this industry fucking sucks and like weight to like tech comes to this and over the last four, five years I've seen a lot of good, there's a lot more tech, thank God. But there's still a long way to go and I think you and your company represent some of that stuff so I'm excited about that. So we'll talk about that and we'll talk about innovating in industries that have opportunities, how you guys think about that, I'll let you introduce yourself to your story a little bit and talk about mascot. So we'll talk about innovating the market but then just in general the card market's fun, like it's in a fun spot, it's kind of like where I see the NFT market being in another year kind of starting to hit now which is like normalcy comes in. You kind of have like that high tide of excitement and the normalcy comes in and the normalcy of day to day card life today is dramatically better than it was in 2017 and 18. Of course it's not on the COVID highs but it's that and similar to NFTs, like I'm watching a lot of people do open mince at 0.09 Andy, like you showed me an epic one today from our guy and like people are still collecting digital collectibles, it's just now people realizing NFT collectibles are like trading cards, 1% of trading cards are meant to be insane, Jordan Rookie, Charzard. Like real, real stuff, not everyone and that's what we're starting to see in NFT land. There's still a lot of collectors. Right now you gotta get over the decline and I still think we're six months to a year of like fully being over that out of the masses, cultural mind and people starting to come back in and getting serious. So like fun stuff and alternative collecting, we're at the forefront of it with VFRIENDS trading cards and VFRIENDS NFTs, like so I'm enjoying this and so it's one big conversation of innovation in the collectability world, which is obviously super fun for me because that has been my life. Besides that little thing I did in the middle with wine, I was in collectibles and then I've been in innovation. So Ezra, that was a big frame up to the episode. Why don't you tell everybody in the VaynerNation who you are, what you do and what the company's about and then we can talk about it, Rips maybe can jump in and da da da da da. Awesome, my name is Ezra Levine, I'm the CEO of a new company called Mascot and I wanna give Dr. James Beckett a little credit here. Obviously Dr. James Beckett is a big innovator in the space and so I told him the name Mascot, we happen to like the name Mascot, we were not thinking necessarily as an acronym, but when I spoke to Dr. James Beckett he said, oh Mascot brilliant, I said why? He goes, because that stands for multi-sales channel technology and I said, you know what, I'm gonna steal that, I love it. So Mascot stands for- Is that what that stands for? It didn't originally, but we're gonna go with it. I love it, I love it. So Mascot now, we've amended it a little bit, Mascot is multi-asset sales channel optimization technology which of course rolls off the tongue beautifully, but essentially what we did is we created an awesome product and I think to your point, innovation in this collectibles industry has come a long way, but there's so much more to go, so much more to go. So Mascot essentially is the easiest and fastest way to manage your collection and by far the easiest and fastest way to sell items within your collection. I know you don't do a lot of selling, but I think this will be very relevant for your audience who does, we've integrated- I'm just trying to get me to sell more shit, but I don't wanna sell, I like that narrative and I like that truth, but I should probably. All right, so on part one, right, so how to manage your collection. So we've integrated with all the major grading companies, so PSA, Beckett, SGC, CGC, and TAG, where we essentially have API feeds and partnerships directly with them. When you put in one detail of your items, all the data around the populates, you can put in a serial number, all the data populates, all the high-rise images populates. So on your collection, Gary, we were testing with Adam, we did 250 items just about in about 30 seconds, it's wild, it's really fast, really crazy. Does Adam have to put in the serial number of my thing and then boom? So three different ways to do it. One is you can drag and drop images, so you have high-rise scans, you can just put in the image and it'll read all the data. You can also put in the serial number, or if you have a spreadsheet, they're working off of, you can just drag, you can- Which a lot of people have. Exactly, so you can upload the spreadsheet directly. What about when I have it in my PWCC vault, like is that gonna be easy? Yeah, so Adam tried it, essentially, he took a spreadsheet from PWCC. Adam, what happened, good? Great. Great. I'm aware. This doesn't even happen, Adam, if you weren't like, no, I really think this might be crazy good. So kudos to you guys. Well, thank you. And so part two of what we do, so we created, again, a multi-sales channel platform. So the selling experience in collectibles is downright terrible, right? So if you create an eBay listing, it takes a long time. You create, if you wanna sell multiple platforms, you gotta create individual listings, it takes time. What MASCET has done is you can integrate all of your secondary market platforms right now, eBay, MySlab, Amazon, Shopify, Instagram. So you created a middleware, talking to the nerds in there. You've got a middleware, right? CRM, you know, content management system where you've sat in the middle of the two most important things, right? What is your inventory and how do you sell it? And by creating really strong tech that really works well on both sides, you have a value prop to a lot of us. Yeah, okay. Is that right, do I have it? Spot on. It connects your collection to all the marketplaces in which you wanna sell. So you can create essentially one listing on MASCOT and it creates multiple listings all across the marketplace. You know, our vision and our thought is that, you know, you wanna maximize eyeballs as a seller, right? As a seller, you want really three things. You wanna maximize eyeballs so it can sell the fastest, right? You wanna sell it, you know, as quickly as you possibly can for the highest price and essentially on your own timeline to get maximum eyeballs, that makes it a lot easier. The technology would also, it does. A lot of people who sell multiple platforms, they have, you know, a really big issue, which is if it sells on one, hold the crap, you gotta figure out, you know, where else it's listed. Then you gotta go back and go into those accounts and remove it before double sale, which could knock down your reviews. RIP, so that used to happen to you a lot because I know when you were a kid, a lot of like Facebook marketplace, but then all of a sudden, eBay, like that must have been your day to day. Did you ever have a double sale vaccine because like the unlucky timing? Or did you suck at selling so much that it never really happened? You got a lot of new platforms and someone has a big game and then you're like, shoot, it sold everywhere. Yeah. And you're gonna suck. Especially in the height of that whole COVID, like I remember like Terrence Davis would have like a good game for the Raptors I'd buy like every rookie card on earth. Yeah, so. Devante Graham. So our technology will essentially automatically remove all of the other listings. So if sales in eBay automatically take all of those. Would you say this is for like the top 10, 20% elite? It's like a super tool and then for the masses, it's just like a stronger piece of technology. I think anyone who has inventory that they wanna manage or sell, it's a great product. We have people who are massive dealers, you know, thousands of thousands of cards, huge value. People who have five cards up there or five items, five comics, whatever it is, zero up, free. Absolutely free to use. You're taking it from the partners? So we're building a premium model too. So you can have the basic skills and the basic tools completely free. We wanna get as many users as possible, freemium and then we're building advanced features. So you wanna set algorithmic price and you wanna do all that great stuff which really saves you a lot of time. That maximizes money. And maximizes money, that will be premium model and all these other commercial arrangements with vendors which allow us to really build a great business. These algos and AI, like the fucking, it's gonna get really wild. It's gonna be fun. Okay, makes sense. How long have you guys been at it? So we took over a company called Slabfolio. Slabfolio has been around for about a year and a half. We came in, I saw this technology, actually at last year's national. I saw this and said, here's a product that makes the industry so much more efficient. Here's a product that, if I clean this up, here's a product that has applications for anyone in this market. Whether you're a dealer, whether you're a marketplace, whether you're a grading company, whether you're just an industry participant, whether you're just a collector, this has so many applications for you. And that is what really got me excited. So I left Collectible, came here, we spent the last three, four months really doing three things. One is cleaning up the UIUX, making it a lot easier to use, doing all the partnerships. We've made the platform so much faster by doing these deals. We now have direct API feeds. The platform's 100 to 200 times faster. And really expanding. We've been in this new form. I joined about four months ago. Meaning, I'm sorry, the product, like for the people that are listening, because we have a lot of card people, some might have looked at it. I don't know, when did it come out as this? Mascot was rolled out about, I don't know when this is gonna air, but probably about a week or two weeks ago. So recent, recent. But it's a huge improvement now also. So this is gonna be the first taste for everybody that goes on. First taste. And what's the dot com? Just to make sure we get a. With mascot.com. With. With mascot.com. And socials at with mascot. With, W-I-T-H, got it. Okay, now let's figure off back and we'll come back to this in a minute. What about your trading card journey? Yeah, I started. Where'd you grow up? Here, New York. New York City? New York City proper. New York City boy. City boy proper. City boy proper. So I was a big, as you are, Nick's fan. I'm a Giants fan, sorry, sorry. Rangers, Yankees. Good, good. So good, good. So my collecting journey, I'm sure started out as pretty much everyone. How old are you? I'm 35. Okay. 35. So I collected a lot as a kid. Were you a Pokemon? My brother, AJ's 30, what am I, 40? 836, and Pokemon was, he did predominantly cards, but there was a big Pokemon, when Pokemon hit, you guys were in a great age. I was all sports. I wish I were Pokemon, because it's, you know, it's exploded. Will you do it no matter? But I was all sports. Got it. I was a product of the Junk Wax era, but I remember, I'm sure you and Asia did this too. I used to set up card shops with my brother in our rooms, we'd go to all the shows. Of course. I used to be at summer camp. My parents would send boxes of cards. I was the coolest kid at summer camp just because of that, for no other reason. And it was awesome. It was a great time. And then, you know, in my career, yeah, I got out of it. I went to Michigan for college and came back to New York, worked in finance, but, you know, my dad's been a big collector. Big shout out to Aiden Hutchinson, VaynerSports. Go blue, go blue. And yeah, I was working in finance, and then I actually started a modern league football league, and it's now the USFL. So we merged into Fox Sports and became the USFL. That's how I met AJ actually for the first time, was through VaynerSports. And then, you know, my dad's been a collector. He kept me in the loop on it. And then, you know, like most of us, when that next wave hit in the 18, 19, 20. I was following it probably in 17, 18. Yeah. You know, just really through my dad. So I'll give him some credit for that. And his passion for it became my passion for it. I saw a lot of his closest relationships came from, from the hobby and from collecting. And, you know, he would always say to me, look, there's so much opportunity here. You know, there's, it's such a legacy model. The business model is the technology. It felt very archaic. And when I was a little bit more. I went to 17s. I think Cleveland, or maybe it was 18, I think it was 17 or 18. The Cleveland show, I was like, whoa. This is, first of all, it's the best. Cause that's how I started my career. And like, it was the best. I just could smell it. But I knew, I mean, compared to what we're gonna see next week in Chicago, it's like two different shows. I remember when I first got into Collectibles, coming from finance, which obviously has a cashier. Collectibles at a time in 2019, if not a cashier. All your friends are like, what the fuck? I remember telling people, I'm leaving finance going to Collectibles. They looked at me like I had three heads. And now, just to show how much the industry has come, when you say collectibles, there's a cool factor there. You know, there's a. They're interested. That's awesome. Yes. And I think people are getting it. I think the story has to be told. What was your favorite card as a kid? Gedar foil. Yep, SP. That's crazy card. Crazy card. That was literally just as I got out. I got out in 93. And that car, like, I really wish I was around for one more year. Cause I was like hardcore 86 to 93. That's such a special card. You had them. That's an awesome card. I do have one. I've got an LT rookie card, which is awesome. 82 tops. But you know, again, I collect, I didn't always collect the most valuable. I collected things that I liked. So I have Brian Leach rookie cards. I have LJ rookie cards. Just, you know, things that, you know, kind of remind me of my childhood and things that I love. As a kid though, it was the foil or now. I'm actually wondering, do you remember as a kid? I do, I do remember. I mean, I was six years old at the time, but I remember seeing that more and more around. It's just being like, I love Derek Jeter. I emulate Derek Jeter. My batting stance in Little League was Derek Jeter. So remember that being the Derek Jeter car. He's gonna be at the national. He's gonna be at the national. Okay, good. What do you think is most interesting right now in the trading card, card part? Like what's your, like as an expert, or at least you've been in it. Experts tough to throw at someone, but like as someone who's in it, and you're very much focusing on your business. So it's not like you're following like the auctions every hour on the hour. But you're in it. So because a lot of people have been in it or come in, like it's funny, I feel like a lot of people that were hot in 18, 19, 20 are starting to come back in a little bit right now. I could just smell the waves again. This is a microwave compared to 18 and 19, but it's some of the people that were out of it for the last two years are starting to come back who are in it in 18, 19, 20. What's going on? Like what's like interesting business fodder or consumer behavior fodder in trading cards right now from one man's point of view? I could go on and on about this topic for sure. There's so much. I mean, I kind of look at this as a tale of two markets, there's the pricing market and then there's the activity market. And I think when you look at the pricing market, obviously you had this big rise in COVID. A lot of those values have come down, but still if you zoom out from just 2022 to now, some of the most iconic cards are still doing unbelievably. You look at the Michael Jordan Fleer 8610. That was a $40,000 card when COVID hit. Now 150, 160 grand, that's a 4X in four years. That's an unbelievable return. Look at the mantle 52 tops in an eight, right? Pre-COVID that was 400 grand. Now it's 1 million, 1.2, 1.3 in that range. That's a great return. So I mean the iconic stuff, iconic is doing great. You collect vintage basketball, I know. So 69, 70 tops. I mean, those are putting up record numbers, Wagner's putting up record numbers. Memorabilia is really caught on, not trading cards, but memorabilia has absolutely exploded. But you do have... Do you like memorabilia? Personally? I love memorabilia. I really, you know this about me, Rips. I struggle with it. I don't know why, I just don't love it. From an asset class, it's very clear. There's one of them. There's three of them. There's five of them. The supply and demand is very clear. When I first come back to it. I don't know why I don't like it. I feel like they're big. I feel like this is where NFTs is gonna do me a favor. Like a big ass jersey. I'd rather, if I can set it to a Merck-Tall exchange and I'm trading the NFTs, similar to what you're doing, and you're making it easier for me to list. And that's what people want. It's bulky. The weirdest thing that I saw when I came back to the market was the pricing of memorabilia versus these kind of patch cards made zero sense. Zero sense. You could buy a card that has a little slice of a patch from Steph Curry. That may or may not have been used in a game. I don't know the exact, but hundreds of thousands of dollars. You could buy the actual jersey that Steph Curry wore in a game, photo match so everyone knows it's real, and it was 20, 30 grand. That to me was like a market. Arb that has started to close. On the activity side, activity is really strong. I know. Right, activity is really good. We're about to go to the national. There's gonna be 100,000 people. Every show that they've put on has been gangbusters. People are loving this stuff. They're clamoring for it. They want more of it. Fanatics has come in, obviously, and essentially gobbled up all the licenses. They've incentivized all the leagues and the players to now start caring about this industry. One thing that I always look at. Things are gonna end up mattering long term in a real way. I agree. When you think about how many collectors there are, data's not amazing, but there's something like a million people who identify as a collector. Of two billion sports fans, give or take, a million out of two billion, that's a tiny percentage. Look at fantasy sports or sports gambling. There's something like 20 to 25% of sports fans participate in sports gambling or fantasy sports. Friction, brother. Friction, it's all friction. This is why what you're doing caught our attention. Like you're eliminating friction. We are eliminating friction. Yes, you are. Which I think has really big potential. And so I see, when you hear big numbers starting out, 10X, 100X, the hobby, when you put those numbers in context versus other ways to participate in sports, it feels very achievable to me. So I'm incredibly bullish on this industry. I think it has a big runway. And I'm very encouraged by the fact that even the prices have come down, activity has stayed really strong. And by the way, I laughed at my dad the other day. He was like complaining that WineTex.com, please sign up WineTex.com, that WineTex is not doing the numbers that did during COVID. And I'm like, dad, nobody was allowed to go to a bar or a store or every single human was home. And you had a monopoly as a category, internet people that could sell wine and send it to your house. Like, do you know how much wine is gonna be drank today in America at bars and restaurants? Like outrageous amounts. That was all at home. And so like, look, the entertainment value of what was going on with trading cards during that time was like, it was fun. Like I was on eBay every minute, on the minute. Like there's other things. I'm at the airport today. Like I'm doing this with you in my office today. Like it's just different, but to your point, if you take that blip out of the equation, the data is very clear of what's happening here. And I think your one million, two billion thing is uncomfortably real and I'll add another variable. You have an entire generation of 12, 13, 14 year olds that think of the sales as entrepreneurs in a way that even you at such a young age, it wasn't as common at 12 and 13 to think that way. You might've thought you wanted to be in business, but like you take on entrepreneurship ambition along with how many collectors have, how many sports fans haven't converted because fantasy and betting has no friction. What am I gonna buy a box, open it, slab it, grate it, go to a show? I'm not doing that shit. This is where what is starting to happen of the stack of the elimination of friction, both through the technology, through the players, you know, the NatX bought PWCC. Like, you know, like these things are gonna start colliding into each other and make it very easy for someone like me who also, one of the reasons I don't wanna sell, even though I have rips and lube, like I can, like, is because just a lot of fucking friction and I'm excited about what you guys and other people in this space are doing. Yeah, one thing too, just, you know, I think one of the byproducts of COVID, even the prices have come down from it, a lot of big companies have come into this market now. I keep hearing new companies that are massive, fortune 500 companies that are getting, you know, into this hobby, Blackstone, Amazon, DraftKings, TikTok, the list could go on and on and on. Fnatic's obviously, you know, even Hedge Funders, Stevie Co and Dan Sonheim, big, big names are getting big into this market. One of the stats that I wanna point out too, just in terms of kind of the selling inefficiency and selling friction in this market, there are 10 times more buyers than sellers of collectibles. 10 times. And there's probably a lot of good reasons for that, but one that I think strongly is that it is so friction-ful. There's so much friction. You mean going to Chicago and shipping all your stuff and setting up a ticket? Easy, right? Easy, easy. I couldn't agree with you more. And as great as eBay is, like, cause by the way, that created an incredible thing cause I was selling cards pre, if eBay was around, if this market existed, when I was 15 years old, I would have never graduated high school. No shot in fucking hell, put the flag in the ground, I'll show you my fucking bullshit report card that's somewhere here, zero chance. So to your point, like I can't even imagine what you and others are gonna be doing over the next couple of years to make it even less friction. Yeah. Just to give everybody context, what we're really going, I think at least where I'm going, do you know how hard it was to buy a piece of a company in 1875? I know that may seem like a long time ago, it's really not. There used to not be stocks to come. Like I can literally hit a button in two seconds right now and own .0003% of a company. Like that didn't exist. And I think just the friction, well, we've said it 10 times, but I think it really sums up why Adam and I are excited about the company, what you're doing and what other people are doing. This move to the elimination of friction, including Web 3. I think the NFT stuff is gonna be a factor. Like it's gonna be fucking rad. All right, we got a couple more minutes here. I wanna make sure that, was there anything we didn't touch on, anything you wanted to touch on in our time here? No, look, I think, when people see the product and they see how easy it is to get items in to manage your whole collection, you could do thousands of items that takes a minute to get your entire collection beautifully displayed, categorized, all that stuff. When you link your accounts and you click one button and now you see the items are blasted out on 10 different marketplaces, there actually is real magic to that and it's unbelievable what our team's been able to create. I think it's gonna make the entire selling journey and just the managing journey so much easier. And so we're incredibly excited. Well, listen, we're excited to see that the national will be, maybe we'll film some interactions, unless Dustin dies from this cough. He'll be there, we'll film it. Yes, thank you. Go ahead, Rips, let's do that. This is a good way to close. I love you. Good job, Rips. I got two good things to say. Okay, go ahead, show me. So I'm with the product right now. You're with the product. So look, I think right off the top, the interface, like for everyone who's listening now who's accustomed to web2 interface and modern stuff, this is kind of what we sniffed out. Look, Google Docs is great and all, but fuck. Like managing this in a much easier way, it's very clear to me how this is structured. This is a blank slate. Yep. It says, let's get started out on Instur Collection. We just sent a bunch of cards to grading for CGC for the national. Yep. Big shout out CGC. Nice, I like your new slabs, by the way, I like the black. So do I. This is a cold hard. You agree? CGC is a fucking interesting thing. They are very technologically savvy. They're incredibly responsive from our dealings with them and they have an unbelievable slab. Yeah, and they have completely dominated non-sports. I obviously got very, very serious because even before VFriends is Rip Snows, I like to buy a lot of weird shit non-sports because I love nostalgia, He-Man and Spider-Man and 1960 whatever, Don Russ, Marvel, 60, what is it, 67? We're already getting rusty. 60, 61 is Fleer basketball. 67, Don Russ? 66, Don Russ, I think it's 66 Don Russ. I literally just made something that I don't know. Okay, anyway, but CGC is a little bit of a sleeper play. Like now they're getting serious about sports. That's one of the weird, like PSA is a beast. I'm a big fan of SGC. You know, I think Beckett, like back to Mr. Beckett. Like Beckett has so much heritage. So much heritage and I have a lot of empathy for them because they're great guys and gals too. I feel like they've got a like tighten, like they got a lot going on with their grading system and they've got to figure that out a little bit. But like, I think it's such a healthy market with like Nat is like a fucking beast. So like I sleep at night knowing PSA is always gonna do the right things. The CGC stuff has really got my attention of how much, especially because with the friends, I feel like I wanna go more magic, the gathering, more Pokemon. So I actually want it to be a predominant CGC winner. Then me and Rips look to the data. They're like very conservative on their grading, which I think longterm always plays out that people like that value. So it's interesting to see you have a, from your perspective, a good look on them as well. I agree, I agree. Go ahead. This is literally a download of your grading order. Okay, of the grading order from the submission. Yep. Which everyone gets when they do all this stuff. So for all the graders, that makes sense. So this was a monster. This was, that was very smart of you guys. So you're saying this literally the fucking slab submission, drag and drop. Like who the fuck wouldn't? Do it all in one. If you wanna do serial numbers, they end drag and drop and files. You can do it all in one screen. Yeah, this is gonna, once people understand this, they're gonna shit. That field. It's all better just to save, no. Sink. So there's three, 300 cards we're doing? 279 cards. 279 cards. I just hit enter. 1% is done, 4% is done, 5% is done. This must be very compelling podcast. 9% is done. 13% is done. But no, no, I mean, this is bananas. Right, so for everyone who's like a little more sophisticated, I know there's a lot of 101 people, I know there's a lot of people that are like into tech, they'll probably check this out, people just starting, especially because of the V-Friends cards. For the more sophisticated who've submitted for grading, and you know you get your report. No bullshit, the downloaded CSV dragged into an interface. I'm now at 72%, we're probably well under a minute at this point. Like the thought that I just am about to have 279 cards in a CRM that looks good, it's done. It's done, all right, click. Click refresh page. Click refresh. I'm just gonna do play by play for everybody because I know this is predominantly audio consumption. By the way, we're also on very bad wifi here at VaynerMedia. We should really address that. I guess that's my fault, so I'll try it. Holy shit, no shit. Okay, and so, all right, so what I'm looking at is a very good visual, like the way you would like it if you're a web 2O person, like it's got the card, all imagery in there, and then I can fill in item cost, tax, shipping. So you can fill that in yourself, or you can upload a spreadsheet that has that data already there. Right, because a lot of people have already do it that way, right. Right, right, right, right. You can sort, you can. That's how you would have it. And you just upload your Excel or Google Doc. You can use your vault, it'll work. You can sort, you can filter. No really, we were high five. I know everything. Stop it, this is fucking really nice. In fact, like PWCC grading companies, when they use the vintage stuff, they don't have the images ready, you kind of have to upload them. But like all the modern stuff, this is literally like two seconds. And then selfishly, me knowing both of you guys for a while, I did, when you started talking about what years things come from, I'd fold up like the top 15, like I kind of repeat cards and I wanted to quiz you guys, we'll open C. Okay, go ahead, what do you got? All right, try it. Go ahead, I'm gonna run into something. I'm rusty though. I forgot 66 Donress Marvel just now, so I'm not very confident, but this should be compelling. So what is the quiz? Literally, I was like, you're talking 93s SP. You're talking about Donress. So what are you gonna do? I fold like some cards from your collection and some cards like that, top 20 most influential working card balls. I'm like who knows. I understand, I don't care about any of that, I just wanna beat Ezra. What is the game right now? I'm the card you named a year. Okay, fair enough. Look, I would say it's your collection. All is in your card. So you've got a little home, as you're gonna love this. Ready for this? Got some home court advantage here. Like your job, I refuse for you to mention any card that is in my personal collection. Use ones that are not in my personal collection. That's gets a little more oddball because you own so many key cards. Yeah, I don't think, just for a record, for a real thing, I do not believe I have an advantage of owning something that every is an iconic card. That's also IPO, like some of the most iconic cards in the world. Let's just play real quick. By the way, on the record, I'm extremely rusty. Are we gonna buzz in here? No, you just yell it. Okay, yell it, okay. Balming from Albert Pujols. 20, no, yeah, 2001. Correct. 2001. Notice I wasn't even in that. That was my dark era. I was building, I wanna give a shout out to my dad, Sasha. Completely fucked me in this moment because it made me work tirelessly from 1998. I thought we were gonna start off with like a vintage, like 61 Fleer. I was literally 61 Fleer on my mouth. I was thrown off by the 2000. No, don't, keep doing what you're doing. I love that. I didn't even have a guess. That's how much I don't give a fuck about Albert Pujols or that card. Score of Barry Sanders. Oh, yeah, 90. 89, 90. Yeah. Don Russ, Don Mattingly. 87. Nope. 84, 84, 84, 84, 84. I still think if you go to the film, I said 84, a hundredth of a second earlier. And his second wrong guess. By the way, I'm optimizing for time, not after, so here. I'm just trying to win. Top's Johnny Unidas. Oh, 55. No. Fuck, I have the card too. Unidas is 54. He's 57. 57, we were close. Shouldn't cut this out, right? By the way, two years ago, I would have gotten all these in one second besides Pujols. Me too. So rusty. Shadowless, first edition Charizard. I'm not a Charizard guy. What? This is all you know. Is that 99? I'm gonna say yeah, it's in the 90s. 99. 99, yeah. Top's Pete Merivich. Pistol Pete. Oh, 69. Nope, no. No, no, keep the segment. Pistol Pete is not that. It's later than 69, 70. Is that a set? Not a cut to seven here. Pistol Pete is what, 71 looks like that, 72? Pistol Pete is 1970. Got it. 70. OPG Wayne Resky. Oh, 79. 79. Good. Top's Jolene. 69. 65. Oh, you're right. Jesus Christ, I thought Super Bowl, good job. Top's Hank Aaron. 54. I know Vintage. I know Vintage. Burn Magic Ervings, Opus. 80. 79, 80. Yeah, you got that. We have three more. Top's Carone, Tindokic. 97. Very good. National Treasures at Steph Curry. In that one again. 2009. Yup. Last one. Top's Football, Jim Brown. 58. Correct. Yeah. When I tell you I needed that more than life itself, it was just I just got my ass kicked. Am I able to give my dad a quick shout out here? Please. So my dad has a great collection. I'm sure my mom will hate me for saying this. But one of his coolest pieces in his collection is a type one vintage photograph of that iconic Jim Brown rookie card. He will be at the national. So I think he's gonna have it on display. It's an awesome, awesome piece. I've seen him many times and it's incredible. As I'm really upset with you right now because you beat my face in and I'm not happy about it, I didn't realize how rusty I was. I'm excited to get, like, I wish we really did this after the national. I feel like I would have had a better chance, but congrats, excited. Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you there. Thank you, thank you. Continue success. Let's talk more. I really like what you guys are up to. Thank you. For everybody listening, you should definitely give it a roll. I think a lot of you are gonna be impressed because I do think the industry has got big shout out to the industry. Tons of great shit. Lots of stuff, whatnot. There's just so many things I'm proud of that so many people have done, but a long way to go of opportunity. Not mad at anybody. We've made a lot of strides in the last four or five years. This is a good move in the right direction, so keep it with good work. Awesome, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
