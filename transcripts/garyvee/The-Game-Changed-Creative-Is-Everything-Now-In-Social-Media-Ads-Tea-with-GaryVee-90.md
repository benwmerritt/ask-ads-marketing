## Transcript
I share an office with my wife. Whenever she's working, I can't really get on what not because she's talking to other customers. Do you know the term you're both me? I understand. You're not going to do it in the same room as her. You could do it literally anywhere else. The reason you're not selling is you're not selling on the best platform. What not? You need to be on what not. I don't give a what time you're on. That it's selling 24 seven. You could sell that one o'clock in the morning or 6am. And you could do it out of any room. You do not need a fancy setup. You've got to start selling cards on what not. Period end of story. We seem to get diminishing returns on Facebook ads. We sell watches and do well getting our ROAS up to a point like 10 K a month. Then it drops. We get about half the return. Do I keep going and spend more? So ROAS is ROAS return on ad spend. The creative is the variable here. If you're having diminishing returns with ads, if you have negative return or you're declining your return on your ad spend, here's what's happening. The creative needs to change. People are over reliant on the math on ads. They get lazy, right Pablo? You know this. You're in the math game with us. But you know when I give you some good new creative, you can cook again. It's like you're the chef. But if I'm not giving you good fucking ingredients, you can only make so good of a meal. The creative is the ingredients. Most people, Aaron, have fallen in love with the math, which is remarkable, but the math now is understood. The creative is the battleground. That person with the watch stuff needs to make 50 new videos and pictures and try new shit. The creative is the issue at hand for most people. Much more creative, everyone. Much more creative. The creative is the variable. One of the reasons I do tea with Gary B is, one, to give back. Two, to give my team more creative. You can see my Instagram's already cooking better with the creative. And three, to build awareness for V-Friends. The next Pokemon, if you don't know, DM us right now. I'm literally building the next Pokemon. And four, giving awareness to things I'm up to. Okay, this next question is from Priya. I'm 19 years old. I have a laptop and wifi and I like talking. I want to be a millionaire in six months. What do I have to do? I'm gonna punch Priya in the fucking face. Come to my office so I can punch you in the fucking face. No pen studio, this is not prerecorded. What are these fucking questions? Did I hear that right? I'm 19, I have a laptop and I like to talk. How do I become a millionaire in six months? I'm fucking finished. I'm outta here, I'm done. I'm actually done. What are we doing? Finish, Sid, I'm done. I'm angry. That was the real question. I don't understand. Like, I don't, you know, obviously I believe half of this is trolling, but what's sad is I know it's not. People are fucking insane out here. I'm having problems having better conversion as far as people wanting to actually purchase products. I read all the comments, I respond to all the comments, and I just wanna be able to have a better understanding of how I can get better conversion on tapping into that part of being actually to make money on the online space. I wanna evolve into my best form and I honestly eventually wanna move out of the physical world space of truck driving and I wanna get into the digital world. When you're trying to convert, are you on what not or Fanatics Live? I am on what not. I have my own affiliate link store from Fanatics that they provided me with a storefront to be able to go ahead and sell their products on that storefront. When you asked me, you asked me you wanna sell more stuff. When you're on what not, are you live on what not and selling stuff or no? So yes, I am alive on what not and selling stuff. I haven't done many shows because of the timing as far as, like I share an office with my wife. So whenever she's working, I can't really get on what not because, you know, it's confidential information that she's talking to other customers. And so it's in the background and, you know, people have told me, hey, who's going on a vacation? You know, cause my wife's a travel agent from home and stuff. So it kind of conflicts with, you know, the aerial, bro, you could be on what not, like, and you could find a different place to do that. You don't need any fancy setup. You could be in the fucking kitchen with your refrigerator in the background. Okay. So that's just like excuse city back to like, your energy's so epic and you're right. Age is just a number and you're a fucking grinder. Like that's very obvious. Are you gonna really with your fucking epic bald head and epic beard and fucking epic energy? Are you really gonna tell me that the reason you can't sell on what not is cause your travel agent wife is in the fucking background? Is that really where we're gonna fucking go? Well, I mean, it's not really where we're gonna go, but like she's talking with, while she's talking to him in the background. Bro, go, go in the, no, no, no, no, no, no, aerial, aerial, aerial, aerial. That's the only thing that I'm worried about, you know. Aerial, aerial. Do you know the term you're bullshitting me? I understand. You're not gonna do it in the same room as him, as her, excuse me. You could do it literally anywhere else. The reason you're not selling is you're not selling on the best platform. The best platform to sell is on what not. You need to be on what not. I don't give a fuck what time you're on. That shit's selling 24 seven. You could sell shit at one o'clock in the morning or six a.m. And you could do it out of any room. You do not need a fancy setup. You've gotta start selling cards on what not. Period end of story. Gotcha. Period. Like this, like, do you not like, do you not like it as much? Like I'm trying to get to the root cause here. There's something that's stopping you from selling on what not. It's not, it's not that I don't like it as much. It's that when I have been on what not, there has not been that much. Sales. Convert sales and convert them on there. Brother, you're just starting. Yeah. Brother, you need to put in, you need to put in the work. I'm watching people like debut sports and splash cards. I watched them go from zero and three and six watchers, but they went on every fucking night, every day, and eventually got there. Yeah. I mean, what are you gonna do? Just need to double down and stream live more. Brother, I don't wanna like, I love you too much to do this homework. I have a funny feeling if I, thank you, bro. I have a funny feeling if I go and look at your what not, you haven't done enough fucking shows. No, I haven't. Well, that's it. What else do you want from me? Like that's like somebody coming to me if I was a fitness guy and saying, hey bro, I've fucking went to the gym twice, where the fuck is the six pack and fucking guns? Yeah. It's simple as that. It's what not. It's disproportionately the place that stuff is selling and you've gotta do it fucking daily. Okay. All right, brother. So what about, what about like the fanatics affiliate? Like since I've been an affiliate with them, I've only like for the past two months, I've only made 10 bucks in total sales, you know? So it's like, how do I double down on that and like push that more for people to come in and buy more just what not itself? Listen to me, go on what not, use your social media, push people to it, email, text friends, just and fucking just deal with it. Like put the 20 bucks into boost your own show and fucking deal with it. No pain, no gain. Like deal with it, you fucking bounced early on very little adversity. Okay. It's not super complicated, you know? Like you're being impatient. It's not complicated. You're like, fuck, where's the money? Like I know you want to bounce from the truck shit and sell cards all day. I get it. That's right. I like that. Good for you. But fuck man, I need 150 shows, two hours a piece before we judge. You call me back when you've done 300 hours, then we can have a conversation. Not the bullshit you're walking in with now. Hey everybody, I'm not gonna keep you long, but I've gotta tell you about GaryVee.com slash Stan. Stan Store, an incredible tech stack for creator entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial creators is literally the tech stack based on what I wrote in Crush It and Crushing It. And really the thing almost all of you are trying to build. So if you are one of those people, go to the GaryVee challenge that I've partnered up with this investment I made in Stan Store. I believe in this. I believe in it for you. You'll see why I love it. GaryVee.com slash Stan. Go check it out. Now back to the video. Everybody on what not? Please share, share, share. Let's do another giveaway. Let's go for the chugular. $250 Blaster Box. Uh-huh. Courtney's face would have sold this. We're giving away a $250 V-Friends Chrome Blaster Box right now. I just resigned from a toxic job. My boss was a narcissist and he made me feel incompetent. I'm struggling with self-doubt now. How can I rebuild my confidence and reignite my passion? By not believing your fucking narcissism. Aaron, the gentleman said, I quit a toxic job with a narcissist boss. How do I rebuild? The easiest of all time. You realized you were in a toxic job and you're a narcissist boss. It's when you don't realize that you're in a bad relationship that you're fucked up. Got it? If you can't see it. The second you see it, what the fuck are you dwelling on? You were wronged, according to you, by the way, that's a whole nother story for another show. The fuck are we struggling for? The fuck are you struggling for? What do you mean rebuild? You're rebuilt, you quit. You did it, it's over. You won. It's over, you did it. We're good. It's over. You won. Yay. It's over. Ezra, I do not understand this concept of dwelling on shit. You know what it is, Aaron? And this is why it's so important. We've had this great run where we started to get a little bit deeper and understand what was a little bit fucked up. But then we went too far and now a lot of people are just deeply comfortable in dwelling, looking for sympathy. Like they're more comfortable in like, hey, I was wrong. He already won. And so what are we doing here? We have to help our children to not do this in the next generation. You know what I mean? Like there's so many bad things that have happened in my life, it's unbelievable. Actually, this is a good topic, right? There's so many bad things that have happened in my life. It's unbelievable. But the issue is that I've just chosen to focus on the things that went well. That's a choice. That's a mindset. That's a perspective. That's something that I think a lot of people can take some value out. Now that doesn't mean being detached or like burying everything underneath so it becomes a problem one day in my life. It's just okay to decide to focus on what is going well versus what's not going well. And this is why fear is such a son of a bitch. Because fear has done so well in the last three, four years, seven years, 10 years, 15 years. Fear has gotten hot. It's got a lot of momentum. It's got us into a place, the masses, that we just wanna stay in our yuck. Every single person on earth has had good things happen and bad things happen. For some reason, and this is very interesting, I was in this really interesting setting not too long ago where somebody was really dwelling and basically telling a stranger that they don't get it, their life was way worse. And this stranger on some straight battle rap dropped like four things that happened in that person's life. And the other people that was, the person that was crying wasn't even the zip code, like the person could have been lying, but wasn't even the zip code of this other person. And just assumed, cause that other person wasn't crying all the time, that their life was so great. This concept from all of you that everybody else has it so good and you have it so bad has to stop. This comparing and thinking like everyone has it so good and you have it so bad has to stop. Do you understand everyone that you don't know anything about most people's lives, including the people you're close with? Your siblings and parents and loved ones are surprising you once every seven years with some shit. You don't think a stranger will surprise you? I don't know, man. Anyway, what do I think? I think rebuild your confidence. Why is your confidence hurt when you were in a toxic narcissist? You should feel bad for that boss, not for you. You're out. That fucking boss is stuck in her, his head and life. They've got real jail. You were in fake jail, a job. That motherfucker's in real jail, a mindset. What's that? What about it? 10 seconds left in the giveaway, over 200 of you on whatnot have not entered. Top right corner, just click it. Please. Who's gonna win this? This is a big win. This is a big win for someone free, 250 bucks. They could just list it on eBay. Free money. Who got it? Phosis with the mostas. Good win, here you go. I'm 34 and I've always had this longing to create, start a business. I don't know what though. I guess I have this mindset that I need it to be unique or totally really different or cool. So I skipped through all ideas that seem too normal or investment heavy. Where would you suggest I start? This is a tough question because like, the reality is, is like putting the idea of building a business on a pedestal is fucking everyone up. Like you start a business when you know what the business is, not because you've wanted to have a business because you thought I was cool and business got cool. This is the same old thing. People start thinking certain things are cool that have nothing to do with them. Do you know what I think is cool, Aaron? I think it's cool to be a male fucking model. I didn't wake up and be like, I'm gonna be a male model because I'm not a fucking male model. Aaron, do you know what I think is cool? Being an international hip hop star. I didn't wake up this morning and be like, you know what, I'm gonna fucking go do it. I'm the next bad fucking bunny. Do you know what I think is cool? Being a world class fighter. But I'm not waking up this fucking morning and going to the gym, I'm gonna be an octagon or I'm gonna fight fucking Canelo next. There's a lot of things that are fucking cool that you're not built for. It's okay, we're the fucked itself awareness. Leave the room. Danny, you're not gonna be a WWE superstar. I know brother, cause you're a fucking twig like me. Yeah, bro. Maybe train, but not us. Me, you and Ezra fit, girthwise, into train. Not everyone can do everything. What the fuck are we talking about? You're 34 and you've always wanted to do a business and you've like, Aaron, it's a, it's, it's, I would tell you, I hate to do this because I do not squash streams, but fuck man. Just that question makes me know that person's never building a business. Why don't you go, here's, for everyone that's in that crowd, go join a business that has eight employees and learn and watch the number one navigate and see if you're about that life. Yeah, next, let's keep going. Okay, this question is from Mark. Thoughts on paid versus free community. Which one do you think is better suited for someone who has an audience and is already an established expert in their field? The answer is both. You should be doing both. If you have a Patreon and only fans, a sub-stack, like having a free machine to drive awareness to that is essential, Aaron. Having a paid subscription and having a huge commitment to free and bringing value is the one-two punch. If you are fully just subscription, you have a hand behind your back. You're fighting with one hand. Maybe if you're Terence Crawford, you can win that fight, but not if you're a normal person. Both matter. You need both. That's the answer to your question. Aaron. Next question is from Yawana. I'm a pro volleyball. Yawana? Yawana. Okay, I'm excited. I got real ammo here. I'm really set up for success here. Go ahead. I'm a pro volleyball player in Greece building a personal brand, have started a YouTube week in the life as a pro volleyball player and doing live streams with my team. How do I make them stand out from the thousands of generic athlete Q&As? By being yourself, Yawana. You wanna stand out. I just needed it. Yawana stand out and everybody asks the same question, like, oh man, how do I stand out? Everybody's doing live streaming. Everyone does cooking content. Everyone does health and wellness content. Everyone, yes. Everyone does video game content. Some people broke out. Clicks, Ninja, others, Mongrel. Like, you've gotta be good. You've gotta be creative. Like, this concept that everyone just deserves to have millions of fans is a wild concept. We're in this era where everyone just thinks that they should have massive followings. The way you stand out is by being good. What is good? Beautiful, funny, smart, entertaining, clever. Like, there's a million ways to stand out. You've gotta pick one. Some people are everything. I don't know if you know this, Aaron. There's some people that are just like wildly attractive, very smart, very funny and charismatic. Like, they exist. And so, the reality is that you've got to really, really, really go there. And really tap in to your uniqueness. All right? That's it. That's it. That's all I got. All right, next question is from Richard. I just had a horrible breakup with a company I founded with a friend. After seven years of being hyper-focused, I find myself suddenly without direction. How do you find inspiration or focus for the next project? Time. We must give ourselves grace when we're going through something quite, you know, adverse. And starting, co-founding a company that then you have a breakup with and you're on the outs, it's very understandable to have a few minutes. I don't understand why we beat ourselves up for a bad moment or even moments. And going back to what we talked about earlier, friends. Why are you a piece of shit if you had a bad year? Why? Why are you a piece of shit if you've had a bad year? Let alone a bad week or a bad day or a bad month. Why are you such a horrible person if you've had three very bad years? Let me break this down. Let me just paint the picture. In the last three years, you broke up with someone that in hindsight was so good for you, it's scary. You lost a job, you got fired. And then you got another job and you got fired. And then you got a third job and you got fired. And now the excuse that the boss and the job was pieces of shit has been shattered because now it's getting to be consistent. You inherited $43,000 from your grandma who died who you love so much, but you never really hung out with and you got the cash and you bought a fucking stupid car and lost 10K in Vegas. Gone. That's your last three years. You know what I see here, and? Just a small little rough patch. You're 32 years old. So 29 to 32 did not go well. What's the problem? What's the fucking problem? Right? Like so? Like that's it? Like I don't understand in this obsession with beating ourselves up. How can I deal with not being able to retire my parents and giving back to them since they sacrifice so much for me? You tell us to be patient for ourselves, but how can we be patient for people when you don't know how long they'll live? I'd like to cure cancer. I'd like to have world peace. You know, this concept that Michael is going to beat himself up and go into depression, anger, sadness, because in his 20s, he's not able to retire his parents. Michael, nobody in their 20s retires their parents. Like fucking 0.01, 0.0001%. Like the amount of humans that have ever lived that have retired their parents in their 20s is like zero. I don't understand this. I don't understand why we continue to make up dumb shit. You know, dumb shit. We're in this place where Michael says, hey, I'm not going to be patient, Gary. You say patients. So what I'm going to do is be sporadic and high risk and gambling, which is going to lead to loss. 99% of people lose when they go that route, right? And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do that because I want to retire my parents. In fact, my overall belief is that that's a bullshit framework. You know, and it's more like some sort of noble, fake excuse, right? Of like why you want to get it done. You just want to get it done because you actually just want to live the life, you know? And so I don't know. I'm just like, I might be way too much in a bad mood because of the Jets Bills game. Am I going to turn from red soon or is this my natural color now? Cause I got fucking blasted by the sun while I watched my team lose 30 to 10. Most people don't retire their parents in their 20s. Some athletes, some entertainers, some content creators. You know, do I believe anything that I talk about when I talk about patience has to do with the ability to retire parents 20s. And then he's making it up on like, when you don't know how long they are going to live. Mother fucker, you don't know how long you're going to live. The fuck are we talking about? Hey, Hanukkah, like what are we talking about? I just, I don't know. Like I'm a little bit fucking tired of these ridiculous questions. Like, sorry, like, don't, fine. Don't be patient. Go fucking gamble. I don't know. Like what do you want from me? That's it, that's all I got. I have no like inspirational thing at the end. It's fucking stupid. Like it's stupid frameworks that are getting people depressed. We're just finding new ways to be upset. I'm 25 and working full time. Deep down, I know I want to build something of my own, something meaningful, but I'm sure when to take the leap. If I start now, I'll have to leave my job and give up a stable income. But if I wait two more years, I'll have more savings. How do I decide when is the right time to leave stability and chase purpose? I think 25 is good. I think 27 is good. They're both good. I don't know what else to say. Like they're both good. You know, like both can work. You know, so more savings is good because he gives you a little more time. Going at 25 is good because you're fucking 25. And if you fail, you could start at 27, save for two more years and start again at 29. You're all fucking children here. People figure out their lives at 40, 50, 60 and 70. Literally, I'm not joking. People figure out their lives at 40, 50, 60 and 70. And I got 20 year olds like concerned and shit. Like, I don't know where this fucking thing is. You know, I just don't know what to say other than I feel good about this kid. It's gonna be fine. Both work. It's all fine. It's all fucking fine. Where do we draw the line between blocking out negative news versus wanting to stay informed? That's a great fucking question actually. I mean, I think it's about surface level grazing. That's what I do. You know, I wanna be informed, but I'm in some surface level grazing. You know, everyone's into doom scrolling and you just get yourself all fucked up. I think that there's an absolute way. I use break the news. Let me show you what I use. Break the web, excuse me. Here's my app, break the web. Right, and it just got trending now. It takes it from everywhere, not just Twitter. And look, I see Emmy winners, Ricky Hatton, Qatar, Israel, Kirk assassinations, like Trump UK visit. Like it's got the news. To me, it's about grazing the information and not going deep. Right? And that's it. I mean, I think it's very simple. You have to protect yourself. Let there be no confusion. The world right now is very, very, very fear based. This is a great era for fear, right? You go back to 2006, seven, eight, nine, 10, much more optimism, less fear. Fear has the momentum right now. And that's what it is, you know? Fear is definitely got aggressive energy right now. And I think there's a way to stay on top of news without going fear. And I think it's about how deep you go. Next question is about V-Friends, actually. Sultan asks, how do you keep the motivation same for each character of V-Friends while developing their IP in the beginning when they are not so popular? Very easily, I'm patient. Just cause Shrewd Shark is not as popular right now as Patient Panda doesn't mean it won't be. Look at Marvel, look at history, look at Black Panther. Black Panther wasn't popular for 30 years. It was a church-erary Tier 4 character in the Marvel Universe. One movie comes out, bam! It's already happened, Erin, in the four and a half short years of V-Friends. Decisive Duck was not popular in the first two years. Decisive Duck, Red Hot, look at Decisive Duck. Made the box of first V-Friends, look at that, Decisive Duck. Right there next to Black Cat. Very simple, because I'm patient. Because I know Mojo Mouse will have its day. Because I know Tolerant Tortoise will have its day. I mean, it's just so simple. Cause I enjoy the process. Cause I'm not scared.
