## Transcript
So I had this whole plan this morning. Yeah. Where I was going to film you coming into the office, doing your keynote from your office. Zach from Vayner Speakers was going to pop in and do a little cameo for DailyVee. Moments later, you texted me saying you're doing the keynote from home. Talk to the people about power of changing your mind and adaptability. Yeah, I mean, that's really easy. Like, I think one of my greatest strengths is adaptability. We are scared to say that we were wrong. And that is killing you. That is ruining your life. I'm fucking wrong all the time. Everyone's wrong all the time. It's called living a fucking, look. It's literally called living, don't leave me here now, Dust. It's called living a life. You're allowed to be wrong. Whose judgment are you living for? Yeah, I changed my mind a lot. I adapt. I adjust. It happened this morning. Like, I got three hours of sleep. I thought I was going to do basketball practice. I'm looking forward to seeing Dust in about five minutes. I think I'm basketball practice at 6.30 in the morning. I told you I'm canceling it. I couldn't do it. Like, I had to change my mind. I'm not what you think. You think I'm embarrassed that all of you are going to think I can't hustle so hard? Who gives a shit? Like, live, you know what I mean? Like, live your life. You know, they always say, right? Like, man makes plan and God laughs. You're good at speaking from the heart. I try to do that myself. It's hard. I believe the reason that I speak from the heart is strictly based on because I'm not scared to make a mistake. I am comfortable with saying I'm sorry or that I was wrong. I have genuine good intent. Changing your mind, being adaptable, changing course, owning your mistakes is an attractive human attribute, not a vulnerability. I'm going into a board meeting. So what I would say there is getting an angle and then a mention of spin master board call. All right? You felt, wait, today you're filming? Yeah. Oh, dude, this one's going to be the best one yet. Who's here? Before I jumped into the hobby full-time, I was a cop for 12 years. Yes. And the messages that you delivered that I wish that I could have then delivered to people that I was dealing with would have been a real game changer because you don't get a whole lot of training, how to deal with a lot of that kind of stuff. And just by like watching the stuff that you post, I always say to myself, man, I wish I would have watched Gary before because I think it's just so relevant in everyday life. Brother, I love you, man. I don't know what else to say. Thank you. At the top of the list of the 10,000 messages I get a week, the thing that most pierces through my heart are from policemen and women. People deeply misunderstand and underestimate what the military and what policemen and women go through. And when I talk about compassion and sympathy and empathy, what people don't understand is it takes strength to be the bigger person in adverse situations. Before you hate that person on the other side, if you can find a little bit of soft skills, and especially in police work, if you can use your words to de-escalate, when you are compassionate to someone versus scared of someone, the tone of your words to de-escalate changes. I'm very proud of how I was parented and who I became. I have a very entrepreneurial part of me, a fun part of me, all this silly stuff like cards, but Beaver Ends has a very significant mission to continue what I've been building as a public figure. And it matters to me. Oh, the patient pig. Can you read the back of that patient pig real quick? Competitive advantage exemplifies patients to remind us that true success comes to those who weigh strategic weight. Vision is a complacency, it's the ultimate ingredient for long-term success. Yes, go ahead and read it, I wanna hear it. This is a one time I end up with my little pony cars. People are so funny. It's amazing how much sadness is in the world. All the people that are leaving negative comments are actually my target audience. What do I mean? My target audience is trying to get people to understand that like how they feel inside is showing up outside. Listen, on what earth does it make sense to take your actual time on earth to spew negativity and hatred about anything or anyone? On what earth? There's not one productive thing that happens about it. People subconsciously, or I don't know what, the human spirit thinks by me saying your shit, I'm better. By me saying your shit, I'm worse. While I totally agree with you, I guess trying to understand the part about how you also say don't listen to outside voices and the hatred and stuff and focus on the people that do like you. I don't say that. I say all the time, I can't hear the booze or the cheers. I don't say that. Thank you. But see, that's what, you know what? That's why I'm so passionate. You know me inside out and notice how you broke that down. That's why I'm so passionate because it's like a never ending game. I'll be long gone and nothing will be accomplished at the scale that I wish I could accomplish. You know? But that doesn't deter me. That actually motivates me. I'll never give up on people. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] You know they always say, right? Like man makes plan and God laughs. As the king of day trading attention. The czar. Yes. Why did you feel that DailyVee was the best way to bring attention to Top's refriends, Chrome? I don't think it's the best way. I think it's one of the ways, right? I mean, I'm on what nots all day long. You know, I'm pounding social and text. I'm using community and I'm going on television and on podcasts. So just one of the tools in the Swiss Army knife of attention, there is no best. There's only ant. This piece has been missing. And in a lot of ways I also thought it'd be cool to have it. And just for myself and my family, could you comprehend watching vlogs of Jim Henson building Sesame Street right now? I would watch the shit out of that. And that's for me and my family, but then hoping that in 991 years. So everybody, I know you humans have gotten weird that they can look at this and maybe inspire some kid to go at it and build their own de-friends. I'm into that. This is crazy. I've never read anyone from the XFN. It's happening. You mind if I take a boat? I'm happy to do it. What's your name? Jayden, nice to meet you, bro. Have a good one. I mean, we learned that Jayden doesn't do online dating. Here now to discuss marketing and advertising. In the age of AI, as Gary Vaynerchuk, how do you optimize for AI versus optimized for search engine? AI is still taking from the web. But if you look like AI, all the different AI agents are taking from different places. Reddit seems to be quite strong. Food and wine, kudos to food and wine out there. They're getting scraped. So the landscape is changing. No matter how much this great program covers it, no matter how many people like me talk about it, collectively everybody's underestimating how big of a shift is coming. Thank you so much. We're gonna catch the train cards. Trust me, I know how this works. And let me leave some for you guys. We'll share them with some people. All right, take care. Stay well. Thank you guys. Read the back of the cards. You'll really like them. Doesn't that mean it gets the cards up to the sky? Like, I'm too empathetic. My point of view is I'm a guest in their house. They have a show to make. It's really what's always worked for me. I'm never scared. Like when I tell you I am like zero percent upset that we didn't get to the cards, it's fine. Like to me, if I'm not bringing value to the audience, the fucking cards don't matter anyway. So like to me that instead of that being a right hook in my terminology, it's a jab, right? Just trying to provide value. I forgot to curve this way. It's one of my favorite, literally, literally when we were pulling up in my brain. I was like, I can't, it's one of my favorite designs. It's really, I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Shook, shook, shook, shook. Need me a little junk stuff, baby, no one's stopped early in the morning. Sippin' a little bit of sun, high floor, with sun, black, with the shit it shows. There's nothin' that's gone, tie the feeling, way on, tie the spot, the sell the soul. Better watch it for the long shots, when you know they on, you gotta be for show. Can't count up all the days that's gone by wasted. Let's forget about the things that brought down rain. All right, Dustin, we gave you the cool night cause we can't let D-Rocket babble into these kind of places. Really good day. Had a very important meeting tonight for Investments purposes and obviously a lot of networking, building out Flyfish Club. It's been a huge success. A lot of people comin' up to me, talkin' about seeing what's been goin' on the last two days on V-Friends and Curious and how do I get the cards and how do I get an NFT and like, you know, I'm sure for all the people that put work in the gym or put work in their school work or building, you know, even fixing up your backyard, there's some real satisfaction to putting in real work and seeing the results of that work. And there's been a lot of work put into this Top Scrooge launch, V-Friends in general. It's been a satisfying 48 hours with a lot more hours in front of us to fuckin' execute. So I'm gonna let Dustin go get some rest and we will see you later. Love you back.
