I'm in the dirt, you understand? I'm in the dirt and I tell a lot of you, so many of you are so interested in getting to the penthouse and I promise you for the real ones who love the building, who love the process, who love the fucking game, you will realize real quick, it doesn't taste as good up there. I love this fucking dirt and I will stay in this dirt until the day I fucking die and then I'll go back in the fucking dirt permanently. I did trade attention and build businesses. The fact that your hands are in the boxes, you're unpacking, I come here, I don't know why that surprises me, but it kind of does. Hearing you even start that way makes my soul feel good. I love being in the dirt, I love being in the trenches, I grew up in a liquor store, flea markets, sports card shows, but yes, I like getting myself into the dirt. The best act we have to design, and you will finish, see that fire, and your birth you will pile, that ain't your free. I'm on a real mission, like as you can see here, this setup isn't for kicks and giggles. We're really trying to build a Pokemon, a Yu-Gi-Oh, a Dragon Ball Z. We are very committed to the collectible market to build out this intellectual property in the same way that I'm committed to the NFT market and the same way that I'm gonna be committed to animation. If I do those three things right for the next 20 years, maybe we'll have something. I keep on trans-mutant misfortunes, remember three a-year late nights, tossing and turning, now it's three a-year. What does it mean for you to have hundreds of kids discovering the game this weekend? Fulfilling at the highest level and a huge sense of responsibility because we have a lot of work to do to continue that momentum. We have a real shot with this game. I see it, I smell it, I do as an entrepreneur and a builder and an operator, I'm moving around the ocean, like wait, there's some blood in that water. I think we've got that blood in the water, and I think you'll see a lot of expansion in the game. Phone live on Fanatics Live with Michael Rubin, the CEO. We're gonna open a Series 1 D-Friends box. They're going for five, six, seven thousand, so we're about to hit it hard here. I'm really excited about it. That was a little crazy. Thank you guys so much. Thank you, brother, thank you for your help. I'll show you one of those. That's really great. It's glass and steel. That's really rad. It's the way of the future, man. I bought the foreign, I'm steaming. Tried bought the session too easy. Don't look back, I'll be gone. No way. What do you got, a fucking gold? There's only 55 of those motherfuckers. Marce, that's paper. That's fucking paper. Tell us about the goal of your brand. What do you want to do with it? I want to trick people into thinking kindness is cool. And then I can die. It's been crazy. Just fucking sweating, getting bashed, getting pulled, getting stepped on by Corso, but in the trenches, you know? I'm always down here, motherfucker. I'm in the dirt. You understand? I'm in the dirt. And I tell a lot of you, so many of you are so interested in getting to the penthouse. And I promise you, for the real ones who love the building, who love the process, who love the fucking game, you will realize real quick, it doesn't taste as good up there. It's not as fucking natural. The fucking dirt is where it's at. I love this fucking dirt and I will stay in this dirt until the day I fucking die and then I'll go back in the fucking dirt permanently. Fall in love with the fucking dirt. I promise you, everything you want is based on the dirt. The humility, the patience, the accountability, the fucking understanding and empathy of others when they shit on you. This is dirt talk, motherfucker. This is fucking dirt talk. It's the fucking best down here. So what you want to know, I'll be my soldier. I've been trying to get. Blueberry in all fucking forms. Blueberry. My girlfriend's brother from England wants to say hi. What's up, mate? I hope you're the best evening. I can't wait to meet you in person. The thing he just said to the person, like can't wait to meet you in person, right? That keeps people alive, dude. Like if anyone's going through hard stuff and for you to say that to them, like that's amazing. Don't look back, I'll be gone. But love the forces, no cruisin'. I fuck the foreign, I'm sleevin' this. Pleasure, man. It's for you. I can't take it. You're not allowed. You literally cannot take it. You're not gonna get a picture. Happy to do it. I can't let you do that. I'm just kidding.

This project started as NFTs. It's always an NFT project. That mix, right? The Comic Con crew. The Complex Con crew, right? And then the Trading Card National crew. Those are three different groups. Some people fit in all of them. I'm gonna focus on those things and I'm gonna build out a great team, support my people, and try to get this world out there at scale. Sure. We're clearing out. We'll see you tomorrow, everyone. I'll wait for you tonight. Tonight. I've been operating all this out the same damn muscle. I've been carrying this pain with my own goddamn muscle. When I slide on through, please, baby, take it off my gut. Just tonight. Tonight. I heard him say that all these girls are the same. And I swear sometimes he drives me insane. But if I slide on through, please, baby, take it off my gut.
