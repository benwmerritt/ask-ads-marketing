Here's a really subtle key to collaborations. The best collaboration is when you and I have 50-50 intent. Really the best collaboration is actually a little bit more nuanced. It's that you and I have 50-50 intent, but we both understand that it may turn out being 73-27. There's too many nuances that go into it. I've done tons of collaborations where they have not worked out for me, but I felt good about it because any of the other person tried. I did trade attention and build businesses. A couple of years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who was a CEO of a company called the CEO of a company called the CEO of a company called the CEO of a company. I'm a purebred entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life is documented. Serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynechuk, founder of V-Friends, has partnered with Gregory's Coffee to create the Jolly Jacko. It's a pumpkin chai latte that's based on the V-Friends character. What are you and Gregory doing? So I created this world, V-Friends. There's about 250 different characters. Think of it for everyone at home as a Pokemon meets Sesame Street. These really cool characters that are collectible and competitive, but pushing good virtues. When Vayner Media just got going on 23rd and Park, Gregory's was the choice of all of our employees. We reached out and said, hey, would you want to do something where we could put this character into a unique new beverage? They were gracious enough to team up, and now people are running all over the city going to Gregory's to pick them up. So when Gary came to you and said he wanted to do this collaboration, what did you think? Immediately connected with Gary, I knew he stands for a lot of the similar things we do. Preaching positivity, hard work, entrepreneurship, all the things that obviously are a testament to me and how we've grown this company. So I thought it was perfect. I think the thing that kind of makes it all work for me is I don't struggle if something isn't going well for a short period of time. I wonder if this is why you've been successful. I like doing so many different things, and I'm not trying to actually maximize wealth. Even though I talk about like, I'd love to buy the jets and it's fun to chase them. I do all these things not because I think it's going to maximize my money. It's because I like it. I need a lot of different things. We're in this incredible setting here in Midtown Manhattan with a fellow entrepreneur from the East Coast that I admire very much, Gregory's Coffee. We're really excited about the Jolly Jacko Pumpkin Spice Chai Latte collab that we're doing. Basically every collab I do, I make pretend I'm fully the other person, and what would I say yes to? I need them to feel like that was the best decision they made. When I liked about this, one of my requests is like, hey, I really want it to be a new drink. Like just slapping my Jolly Jacko on. Would make an instance. Exactly, it doesn't feel authentic in reverse. The word collab, collaboration, please go Google it. Because what I see from a lot of you when you try to do a collaboration is you try to win the deal. It's what about me? Yeah, I'm VaynerNation. Thank you. Please get your ass to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, DC, find a Gregory's, and order loudly and proudly a Jolly Jacko Pumpkin Spice Chai Latte. Thanks for listening. Thank you. The definition of collaboration is to work together. Why do you think people have such a hard time? I'm just missing my idea. A lot of people come from a mindset of scarcity and you don't have to win the deal. You win the deal when both people feel great about it. People struggle with trying to find the balance between being good for them and being good for yourself. And I think that's just all relationships. Here's a really subtle key to collaborations. The best collaboration is when you and I have 50-50 intent. Really the best collaboration is actually a little bit more nuanced. It's that you and I had 50-50 intent, but we both understand that it may turn out being 73-27. There's too many nuances that go into it. I've done tons of collaborations where they have not worked out for me, but I felt good about it because I knew the other person tried. Take that off. That's how you do it. Welcome to October's Wine of the Month Club. I am here, Gary Vaynerchuk, former host of Wine Library TV. Branded three, Hempick Red Wines. As we are now in red wine season, we're in the fall. But it is nice in New York. What I most enjoy about things like this is the serendipity of a night like this. When I kind of look around and realize how many people are going to connect for the first time and what that's actually going to lead to. One of the things that all of you are doing as you continue to produce content and put it out there is you're building reputation. Many of you in this room know that I pounded and yelled and screamed every single day, saying, TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, when everybody was scared to leave Instagram because that's where they had their audience. Most of the unlock of growth and being genuinely happier is predicated on all the things a lot of you want to say, but you don't post about because you're posting for growth, not posting for purpose. I just want to tell you something because I feel like I wouldn't be right here right now without you because years ago I applied to work for your company. I went through three rounds and then I got rejected. The one critique, I was like, I think one or two rounds away from talking to you directly. But the one critique they said was that I needed to be posting more for myself on my media. And then you went and did it. I'm so proud of you. If it wasn't for that, I would not be here. I'm so proud of you. Good for you. All right, everybody. I'm in my office. I'm about to go live in our Fanatics Live studio. We're about to give away a ton of shit, so I'm super excited about that. That's good Fanatics Live. What's fucking good? The following item is for auction. It is a perfect Persian cat nine. But the kicker is you also get 15 minutes with me one on one next week on Google Hangout. We're doing a huge fucking giveaway right now. Get ready. We're doing an auction right now. One of the biggest right off my fucking wall. One on one physical canvas. We love you. We got a lot coming up. Hope you had a lot of fun. Wish you well. Give me your feedback. Thank you guys. I appreciate everyone's support. Yeah, let's clap it off. It was a fucking wild day. The life of an entrepreneur operator who sees happiness and joy as part of the equation. I think so much more happiness and fun needs to be a part of all your entrepreneurial journeys. So I hope you enjoyed all the stuff we did. A lot of different looks today. A lot of V-Files. We'll give it to you all. Love you and see you.
