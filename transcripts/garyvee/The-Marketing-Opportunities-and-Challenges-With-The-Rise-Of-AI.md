I think AI overall though is far bigger than people realize. People are scared of it. There's so much fear of like, I'm gonna lose my job. The robots are gonna kill us. And that Providence moment of truth's about to come very handy, because AI's about to make a lot of fake stuff. There's already videos of me on the internet of me saying things in my voice that I didn't say. I'm thinking about becoming a music artist. I think I can be good at music, one problem. I can't sing for shit and I'm not musical. Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh. It's pendulum swings. Technology in, technology out, and I think I will use AI to actually make hit music. I really believe that before I'm done. I would argue food styling and commercials is more fucking AI than AI. I haven't seen a fucking whopper in my life that looks like the ones on TV. I think that this is a demonization of modern technology that is a misnomer of human behavior. There will be incredible room for originally created human art, but there will be incredible room for a generation of art. So I haven't had a full conversation with anybody yet this week on the record about AI. I figure you are a good person to pick their brain on about AI and less about where it's gonna go in marketing and advertising, but more how consumers and overall going to feel about it and general society, because I think you have generally been smart about how you think about the future. And so I wanna start with actually looking back for a moment. You made a huge bet on NFTs and eventually morphed it into Vayner three. As you saw the NFT market change and how society feels about metaverse and all that change over time. So I'm curious what lessons you learned from that, knowing that AI is also an aspect thing. And I know they're different because that was a platform and this is a societal thing. They're majorly. Yeah. No, it's a very smart question. No, no, I think you're right. Similarities. It's interesting. If you look back at my content on web three and specifically NFTs and you gotta dissect it and I think the same thing is gonna happen with AI. You're gonna appreciate this. In a world where everything is headline reading, I'm sure that, actually, I need to start asking more journalists how they feel about most people just reading their headline and not their actual work. So let's break it down. I'll go backwards and I'll go forwards. Backwards, so much of our biggest point of view was that metaverse wasn't real. That there was nobody actually there at the date trading attention. Yeah. Comma, blockchain was a profound technology. I think blockchain's relationship with AI and deep fake videos is gonna be a really interesting conversation over the next 10 years. Yeah. Three, you know, my biggest point of view is that 99% of NFTs were gonna go to zero and that the 1% would be meaningful collectibles like trading cards and comic books and sneakers. Biggest learnings that I apply to where we're gonna go with AI, one, they are different because the NFT was an individual form factor on top of a technology. Yeah. That was also based on collectible speculation which created so much of the radical ups and downs. Yeah. AI is oxygen. It's such a profound, overwhelming technology but I think the parallels will be similar. For Madison Avenue, I think the biggest observation is that Madison Avenue is very different than Silicon Valley. Yeah. So I think the depth of conversation at AI at the conference has been really interesting. It's by far the busiest word. Yeah. I think back to what I focus on which is about like today. Yeah. The biggest AI conversation that I'm, you know what I was surprised about? Even though I, you know what's funny you said earlier, I wasn't surprised but I was surprised. Yeah. I'm not surprised but I'm surprised. The biggest AI conversation currently in marketing is the algorithms of the 4U pages of all these social networks. Yeah. The most significant AI that our industry's feeling is in that environment. Now to consumer. Yeah. People are scared of it. There's so much fear of like I'm gonna lose my job. This is bad. The robots are gonna kill us. So there'll be a sector that I think will be similar to electricity when it first came out. Yeah. Electricity was like incredibly demonized when it was first available to people. The most common belief at the time was there was demons in it and so you should still use candles. Yeah, cool right? Yeah. Have you, do you know that? I do not know that. Have you ever Google it or chat GPT it back to the point? Perplexity it. Or perplexity it. So I think that's my historical comp that I'm feeling. People are very, very worried about it. Yeah. I think you'll have a group of that. I think we're already seeing profound, profound consumer changes. So I hate using a focus group of one, but boy did it capture my attention. My 37 year old brother and co-founder of Vayner who runs our sports agency now, he doesn't use search anymore at all. 100% of his search behaviors and that chat GPT or perplexity or things of that nature. So I think you're gonna have an entire generation of Gen Alpha and young Gen Z that is going to potentially, probably Gen Alpha, potentially live in a world where they don't even know what a search engine is the way that, how old are you? 36. Did you ever use the yellow pages? Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, you caught on a little bit? I'm a little, give me some credit. No, but you're right, no, no, no. But you know, as you know, if you have a younger sibling under 30, like no shot, there's people 25 that don't even know, when I use the reference they don't even know. So I think it's gonna be the classic thing. I do think the, I view that, so NFTs was a build on top of a big technology known as blockchain. And that Providence moment of truth's about to come very handy, because AI's about to make a lot of fake stuff. There's already videos of me on the internet of me saying things in my voice that I didn't say. So Providence on the blockchain is gonna actually become pretty powerful. I think AI overall though, is far bigger than people realize. And so what do I think? I think you'll have some early users that are gonna get a lot of value out of it. You're gonna have 50 to 70% incumbents that are gonna demonize it, or demonize it because they can't make money on it, or demonize it because they're scared of it. This one isn't gonna be fatty like NFTs. This one is gonna slow build like social media. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in that very unique age range where I started high school, or nobody had a phone. I finished high school, everybody had a flip phone. Started college, maybe a few people had a smartphone, and by the time I finished college, I had one. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah, it's a funny group. So in eight years went from phone, personal phone wasn't a thing unless you were an adult. To the supercomputer you had. The iPhone, whatever you needed in your pocket. Yeah. But I wanna ask about your point about blockchain. Are you pointing out blockchain and deep fakes from the standpoint of blockchain can track how something, the progress of something, so we'll be able to verify something is accurate based on how it takes. Every video I make, I'm gonna make an NFT, a non-fungible token. The way everyone knows NFTs right now is a collectible. And the way they know it right this second is a collectible that was like fatty. But NFTs aren't beanie babies. Individual projects at NFT land are beanie babies. NFTs are stuffed animals. They will be forever. One of the most important use cases I think in the next decade of NFTs is going to be using the blockchain to put your content on to say all the content that I make about me is here first, then I'm putting it on the internet. So anything that you see that you think is from me, you better go see the provenance because this is somebody else manipulating what I'm saying. We've lived in a hundred years of believing every video that we've seen is true. We're about to go just to your eight year analogy. Let me use it now as a build. We will go from everybody here sees any video. They believe it's 100% true to an eight to 10 years. Everybody here seeing a video and not believing it's true. That is societally a big, it is until you say, wait a minute, or the blockchain and then truth. So I agree with you in the short term, it's like, whoa. But this is why I'm kind of very fascinated by the blockchain. Yeah, I've been pleasantly surprised there has been a ton of details around the election yet. I mean, I assume we are about to kind of get there, but I guess maybe we're too far away from November, but yeah, I'm curious how you see the perception of how societal perception of generative AI is going to change. I think we already saw the first bit of it with the Apple ad, but even though it was in towning AI, it was crushing art. And I think people view AI as, we don't want it to replace art. So are you optimistic that people are gonna put up a fight and save arts and not give in to just, well, anybody can create any kind of content using AI. No, do you know that everyone thought a canvas piece of art was not art 100, 300 years ago, that if you did not do art on a actual building wall that that wasn't real art. There was an incredible fight that art on canvas was fake art. One of my good strengths is history tells me the future. This is my second cool, hmm. And you could see how my brain works a little bit. And this is when I see new things like this. I'm like, let me get educated. It's not like I know all this stuff. You know, I do the research, right? And then it becomes part of my life. So I think this industry, actually this is a good parallel to the overall industry. And it's the answer to your question. I believe one of the biggest shortcomings of our industry is that we like or not and. The answer to your question is and. There will be incredible room for originally created human art. But there will be incredible room for a generated art. And the consumer will accept both. You know why? Because they're already consuming both. They're already accepting both. The world is not the opinions of the artists that this is meant. The opinion is of the eight billion people and how they interact with the art. Yeah. So to that point, do you, I mean, when something like, let's just talk music. With AI, music is gonna become even easier for anybody to figure out how to make. Do you see society pushing in a way where someone who can play a violin at a high skill is gonna get pushed out for somebody who can create whatever on their laptop, on their phone, using AI. Or do you still see a future in which both of those are gonna be equally valued? And that we're gonna really fight hard to protect human-made art. I think both will happen. What about house EDM music? What about DJs? Yeah. I mean, everybody told us Electron. What about Auto Tube? Yeah. T-Pain fucking had every hit song for a three-year window. I'm very bullish on Ant. I think to your point, like I'm thinking about becoming a music artist. I talk in the way that would work really well for music. I'm very, you know, I'm good for interviews, right? Like, it's how my brain works. Analogy, snippets, headlines. I think I can be good at music, one problem. I can't sing for shit and I'm not musical. I got that in common with you. And me. I can play mean saxophone, can't sing full of a tune. Can you? That's pretty cool. I got nothing. Other than I think I can write hooks and have bars. And I think I will use AI to actually make hit music. I really believe that before I'm done. And so, will some people say like, what the fuck, fucking Gary V's down? Of course they will. I could, 93% will. 7% will say like, the same thing, you know, is Avicii good? Some people think Avicii's the best. Other people think that he just took other people's shit. So, is Andy Warhol the best? At the time he was the worst. Now we think he's the best. Some people think he's the best. And so, I really, I'll go back to my and. I think that and. Let's talk about technology. I couldn't believe more in social on the phone. Do I believe that now that we've had 15 years of it, that a lot of people enjoy putting their phone in a safe for a week and not being on a phone? I sure do. It's pendulum swings. Technology in, technology out. And so, look at fashion. Every 20, 30 years, are we supposed to wear tight jeans or loose jeans? You know, like. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. So, I think that's what's gonna happen with music and entertainment. Yeah, I mean, I think we've seen it, seen it in the social media. I mean, if you would have told me 10 years ago that by 2024 I would have pretty much given up sharing any part of my life on social, which is a thing that a lot of people are starting to buy into. I think you, I would have said you're crazy, but I think we eventually also just get tired of sharing our lives constantly. I live the life the whole time. People are very confused when they, I don't think people realize how I played it. I've never shared a single thing about my personal life. Yeah. I, it makes so much sense to me. Why would I want to give up my privacy? Yeah. There's nothing more valuable. Yeah. My relationships, my family. I'm one of the most prolific content producers in the last 15 years. Yeah. With zero of it being about my personal life. So I understand that. I saw that coming from a mile away. Yeah. Putting my children in my content, what if they don't want it? Yeah. Putting my relationships so that the world, didn't anybody see what they do to Brad and Angelina? Like, why are you giving the world? Obviously not, we're not all famous, but if you're, by the way, when your life is small, when 30, 40 people, your relatives and your friends are your world, their judgment on your relationship is powerful. Yeah. Yeah. So let's start to bring this a little back back to the market. Yeah, let's do it. Have you, when you talk with your clients and brands in general, have you started to see brands figure out where the line is on where they want to use Gen AI? One more time, my friend? Have the brands, your clients, started to draw a line in terms of where the line is on Gen AI? So, for example, Duff, Duff has said, we'll use Gen AI, but we will never generate a human being. Got it, got it. No, we think that our recommendation to our clients is don't jump out too fast. Yeah. That would be like, there was clients, it's very in history now, that said they would never use influencers. They only believe in real celebrities. No, our conversations with clients, my conversations with clients are very heavily predicated on the following, which is, you don't need to make an official statement yet. That's right. This is very profound technology. Many of the Bill Gates said the web was a fad. He's a smart man. You don't need to be out in front. Let's take a beat. And so, that has been our recommendation. And I think that's the right thing. Like it's early. Ready for this? I'm on the record that's saying Duff, at some point in its consumer brand journey, will make generative people. Because not that I believe that anyone at Unilever is a hypocrite or a stupider is wrong, but in 27 years, when it's a different regime, and generative AI human content is incredibly important, I don't think that Duff is gonna wanna give up market share. You know, so like, I'm sure it's, and by the way, I know that it's well intended. It actually comes, you know, I think most things are well intended. Like eighth place trophies were incredibly well intended. But I think looking at history, it's not gonna be viewed as a positive thing for kid development. Duff, talking about real beauty, that's a beautiful, like it comes from such a good place. On the record, I don't see any scenario that in 35 years they haven't done it. Because there'll be a competitive disadvantage to a business. I mean, even in instances where, so I was talking to the CEO of, he was CEO of OKRP and now he's part of the broccoli OKRP. And he said, you know, I have restaurant clients who they'll let us use Gen AI for anything, except the food. 100%. Because they're chefs. They only wanna show things their chefs can actually make. And even if they use Gen AI to perfection, nobody made that burger. Let me take the counterpoint. Every single commercial that Burger King shows the whopper looks nothing like the whoppers I get at Burger King. That's a good point. Mm-hmm. Yeah, food styling is a thing. No shit. I would argue food styling and commercials is more fucking AI than AI. Yeah, I'm sure. I haven't seen a fucking whopper in my life. That looks like the ones on TV. Yeah. Do you have a sense with brands that they even have their heads wrapped around Gen AI that well? Because I was talking to Sir John Hegerty earlier today and I asked him pretty much the same question. Yeah. Of, you know, have you seen brands draw the line? And he goes, well, no. I mean, it's so early days that most of them, I think he said, can't fucking wrap their head around it. Or don't, I forget exactly what he said. But, you know, he basically said they don't know what they're doing. And so, it'll be irresponsible for that. As someone who came into this industry and has been in and out for 15 years, I'm so glad that Sir said that. Because I've always liked him a lot, actually. I always have. He's a smart guy and he's right. That's absolutely my take. I said it, I think, earlier. Madison Avenue versus Silicon Valley. Like, with all due respect. And this is an incredible community. Deep technology knowledge is not what's happening here. This is sales and marketing. And so, yeah, no, I don't think they have their heads wrapped around it. And by the way, there's a lot to get through with copyright and trademark law. This is probably one of the more conservative stances we've taken as an organization. We want to really understand where the content's coming from. Because we have to indemnify our clients. So I'm like, fucking, are you kidding me? I'm not looking to battle Disney if they claim the elephant that was made from this was inspired by the Dumbo IP. So we got a little ways to go. I think he's right. I think it's early. Again, especially after four glasses of rosé at Cannes, people like to pontificate about their knowledge about AI. It's not, this is not the epicenter of AI. This is an industry that will be affected by the epicenter, which is the technology sector. You brought up algorithms earlier. And I know we've talked a lot about gen AI, but with algorithms, it's also a very good point because we've seen how quickly society has fractured, how content has fractured in terms of audience. My TikTok feed is going to be drastically different than yours, just different areas. And so we're losing a sense of community because we're slowly growing into, I'm fans of these people, you're fans of these people. And you have no idea of what they are. I would argue that that is a false POV in this society right now. Okay. Let's take it back pre-social media. You chose to watch Vox and I chose to watch CNN. You chose to read The New York Times and I chose to read Post. But the options were much fewer. Yes. Now there's a million different influencers and 72 may end up in my feed and you might have two of the same ones. Just cause the options were fewer. Do you know what the average amount of channels people watch when they had 36 channels to choose from Prime Cable era in the 80s? Three. The options were fewer. But I still didn't watch Food TV. I watched ESPN and I watched when the Jets highlights were on and I turned off when the Broncos highlights were on. I think that this is a demonization of modern technology that is a misnomer of human behavior. The fragmentation has existed forever. People always read the books they want and read the newspapers and watch the TV and listen to the radio. Yes to your point absolutely on fewer options. The misnomer is we didn't take advantage of those fewer options. I'm not quite on it. That point's not landing for me. Please. You know if back in say the 90s or 80s when you had fewer options and cable TVs first exploding we saw, you know, amount of people who watch a program far higher than today. So if you went into the office. That is correct. You likely had a number of people who you could talk to about something. So what I'm saying is more, it's fragmented so much that I could go in the office and there's no guarantee that any single person in the office. That I'm a buyer on. That I'm a buyer on. That's what I was the point at. I'm a full buyer on that. But I would say the nuance there is that the genre of it would be within the same range of the same realm, meaning you may know of a hip hop artist that's emerging that I don't know. But we made both like hip hop. Right? And I would actually say the discoverability of that game is real. But to your point, the extreme fragmentation is well taken. And I'm a very big believer in that. I don't think it's focus groups of one. But we've definitely to your point gone to smaller groups of interests. And so I think we're gonna find out what that all means. To your point, we all watched MASH. Now we all watch humor in 87 pieces of MASH that add up to one MASH. And to your point that I think you're making is that has the potential to make us not be as connected. And I think that's real. Yeah. I know I get excited when my wife shares a TikTok that I've already seen. Cause it's like almost a shared experience. Like, oh, I've already seen this and I can laugh at this already. Yeah. Where's it gonna go from there? So do you see a tipping point in which at some point we are all driven back to maybe more communal things within entertainments? I hope so. Yeah, yeah. I think so. I don't think, but I don't think in the short term at all. You're 36? Yeah. You know, back to like guessing this. I definitely don't know. But if I had to bet the farm, you're like, Gary, I'm sorry, you have to bet. Yeah. When you're 68. I think we're in the, actually, I think we're still in the very beginning of fragmentation at scale. Yeah. Honestly, I do think loneliness is a big concern of mine at fragmentation at scale. Yeah. Absolutely. I believe that there is absolutely early indicators that, but I also think that requires human accountability to be more multi-dimensional. Yeah. Like to be more selfless, not selfish. I have my interests, but let me be curious and selfless and open to all my friends' interests so that we connect. It's an, this is a real, I'm very fascinated by this combo. And I spend a lot of time thinking about this. It's actually, by the way, why I think everyone has marketing wrong. The idea that you're gonna make a 30-second commercial and you're gonna pump it on television. Yeah. And it's gonna work is fucking delusional in the truth of the world. Yeah. Final question, because we're pretty much at time here, is just, with streaming TV and the ability to really understand who that person is you're showing, have you guys begun thinking about using AI to create, God knows how many versions of that ad to show each person the way you're already doing with your VaynerValue model for social and every other. Yes, we have, but we do believe it is still a trademark and copyright issue. And we will not go full generative AI over production until there's more, this goes back to why I think Dove is well intended, but a little premature. It's early and we have a lot of things to figure out. Yeah, cool. Cool.
