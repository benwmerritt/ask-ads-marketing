I think Superbowl Commercial is the most underpriced ad in the world. If you said you have $25 million to sell something, I would buy Superbowl first, then I would look at Facebook because I know I have all of America's attention. The sport of watching the commercial is real. You're gonna either watch it on YouTube or you're gonna watch it during the game. So right now it's Facebook video. I'm dying to see what Snapchat's scaled API product is which is videos in between stories but how are we gonna react? Are we gonna be sad if there's video? Instagram video's gotten a lot better literally in the last 60 days. So I'm starting to get a little bit more excited about that. YouTube's new pre-roll based on people's search, that's really interesting. So it's one thing to run a video in front of a sports highlight. It's another thing to run a video in front of somebody who last week searched Nick's season tickets. Like you have a totally different lead there. So it's a, you know, whereas I used to make fun of pre-roll and I even just did right now, I didn't go further down which is, but there's one product Google just put out that I'm very fascinated by which is this search thing. But keep going. That's it, yeah. So that's the state of you. Facebook video is so underpriced it would make your head spin.
