They've had what about 11 commercials in the Super Bowl and you have one this year. Yeah. So what's the product? Starrie, which is the new lemon lime soda that's sweeping the nation, Old Spice is in it. And so we expect a ton of reaction. Old Spice or Ice Spice? Excuse me, Ice Spice. Thank you. It's a little early here. But Old Spice is boomer. Snickname. That's it. I got my body wash. By the way, we might have just set up next year's Super Bowl. Boomer and Ice Spice could be a remarkable spot. A remarkable spot. The attention is the number one asset. Gary, thanks for being with us. How are you this morning? Boys, I'm well. It's good to see you. And I'm happy to be here. You know, Gary, I gotta tell you, you are misdepositive. I mean, you are optimistic about everything. That's one of the reasons why so many people love you and love to hear you talk. And you always come at everything with this rosy attitude, which I totally appreciate. But practical. Right. No, I know it's all practical, but I totally appreciate that. The people I work with on this radio station are totally pessimistic about everything. Well, good news. I'm pessimistic about the jets. So there is one common place that I understand the concept of cynicism, pessimism and concern. So you're walking into a hornet's nest. I'm just telling you. Well, listen, I try my best to, you know, lift their spirits and everything else, but it's almost impossible. So take us through your emotions beginning of the season four plays in Aaron Rodgers and the Achilles. How, how did you react? Let's take it back a couple of minutes before that. I looked over to my brother, AJ, and I said, is Vinny the honorary captain? And you know, literally the only other time that the mainstream media universally thought the jets had a real shot was 99 coming off the 98 FC championship game. We loaded up with all those guys at water and Eric Green and all those guys. And obviously Vinny was out for the year in that first game. And so the fact that even I took note of that. And then when Aaron went down on the fourth play and then when he sat down, I'm like, he's out for the year. This was it. And I was like, I'm just a bad human being for bringing into this world. It's the one place that makes me understand how people think about the real world. To your point, I'm practically optimistic. I think there's always a way, especially by the way, for anyone who's listening to this, you live in America in this world of the internet and social media. Like we're talking before, like there's unlimited opportunity. And if you decide it's bad, then it's bad. And if you decide it's good, it's good. But I can't control Jets football. That's a whole different genre. That's the reality of your life. So, uh, Gio was talking about everything that you're involved in. I know you've had what about 11 commercials in the Super Bowl and you have one this year. So what's the product? Starry, which is the new lemon lime soda that's sweeping the nation, old spices in it. And so we expect a ton of reaction. Old spice or ice? Excuse me, ice spice. Thank you. It's a little early here. Old spice is boomer. I got my body wash. By the way, we might have just set up next year's Super Bowl. We're an ice spice could be a remarkable spot, a remarkable spot. Yeah. So 30 seconds for $7 million a spot. I think it's underpriced. What I do for a living at VaynerMedia or ad firm is try to analyze what's underpriced and overpriced media buying. It dominates because it's not a set price. You bid on it. And so there's a lot of angles, a lot of ways to kind of day trade attention in traditional media. There's floor pricing, a billboard newspaper, television, radio, but to actually get people to consume it. So much media is spent on how many might hear it, might see it. Super Bowl is must see TV for the commercial itself. As a matter of fact, a lot of this Taylor Swift crowd normally just watches for the commercials. They're going to watch the game this time. Right. They're going to watch the game. That's right. Especially if her boyfriend does something like he did two weeks ago. And he will do something. It's interesting. You talk about this. Yes. I actually, for the last 13 years, have hosted a show on CBS called Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials. Yes, I'm aware. I'm just ridiculous. I mean, it's an hour show and we're re-showing, you know, all these commercials that you've seen before. It also rates well. People watch it. It's always the highest rated in its slot. So it's great. I don't think it has, well, I think it has more to do with Danny, Danny Rua, than it does me, I will be honest, because she's great. But the fact of the matter is, you know, Tony Toronto, one of the guys who sells the ads for CBS, to hear you say that it's underpriced, he's right now sticking like a knife in his eyeballs. I could have gotten $10 million. Look, I think they're underpriced. I mean, there's, when I look at what the Fortune 500 companies spend on all sorts of different activities, millions of dollars that don't touch a fraction of the potential of actual consumption. I think it's a, it's a huge opportunity. Look, it's a lot of money. It's only seven million to place it. Then you got to make it. The celebrities cost money, the production company, us agencies make up a little bit of money on it. Do you have a celebrity in your commercial? Yes, Ice Spice. Ice Spice. I'm sorry. That's Ice Spice. Okay. So when you decide, do you know when it's going to be playing? Yes, I think it's in the first half. But the way they do it is based on series. So as you can imagine, as someone who's played football, some drives last longer than others. So it's either late first, early second quarter. Gary Vee, in studio with us this morning. Thanks for getting up so early and coming down and hanging with us. I want to get your take on what Bud Light has gone through and now their approach where of course there was all the controversy and the route that they had with their previous marketing director and getting a Devon Mulvaney involved. Yes. And now they have gone, swung the pendulum the other way. Yes. And then they have gone to the next thing, Shane Gillis, the testosterone C. UFC and everything. So from your standpoint, your expertise in this field, are they doing the right thing? Look, the reality is nobody who's driving right now is confused that America unfortunately has gotten way too extreme blue and way too extreme red. And the reality is we need to get back to purple to get on track because people are distracted. So in those high emotions, just like high emotions in sports, there's going to be things that happen. They adjust to, look, businesses are in the business of doing business. So they start getting affected with negative sales. And so what are they going to do? They're going to create scenarios. But the reality is, is that right now we're in such a hornet's nest for all brands and all of them are treading lightly because they don't want to get caught up in this political tornado. And really in 2024, we've got an election year. So this is probably going to be the most conservative content you'll see from people. As far as have they done the right thing? Anytime you get punched in the face, you've got to react to it. And it's always a challenge to get up and hang on and finish the fight. And so from my perspective, they've done a really strong job of weathering this storm. I'm trying to come back. 100%. They lost $27 billion in market cap. It's insane. And so look, I mean, the reality is, is like, these brands are definitely a little bit more timid because they don't want to deal with either side of the slide. Yeah, but Bublite's not being timid. I mean, they're trying to get back into the frat house brand that they were according to the previous marketing director. But I would say this, they were they I'll use the fighting analogy again. They were quiet in the upfront properly. When you get knocked down in the second round, you're holding on in the late second round, third round, you're trying to get your stuff together. By the sixth, seventh round, you can go back on the offense. That's how I see it from afar. I follow you on Instagram. You're always talking about this wine situation that you have. Yeah. And I've now I haven't gotten involved with this, but why not? Well, I just that's unfortunate. I'm too busy. And I want to know you're too busy to get a text on an $80 wine that's we sell for twenty bucks and you can just hit the number three and it comes to your home. That's the that's the reason that exploded. It's literally the easiest way to buy wine. Yeah, I had no better excuse. I need to get involved with this. But so did you hear this this idea? This is genius. Absolute genius. So friction. So the way I think about everything is friction. I launched wine library dot com for my dad's liquor store in Jersey in 96 because I thought it was better to buy wine. And the first three, four years, everybody made fun of me. Like, why wouldn't I just go to the wine store? I'm like, because buying on the Internet's better. And it took a while. Cheaper, better. And so, yeah, I mean, I think everything when I think about consumers is eliminating friction. Got it? Yes, yes. Speed. So how many people buy a twenty eight dollar bagel in New York City? You know, many people listening right now bought a twenty eight dollar bagel because they ordered it on postmates, paid the big paid the delivery fee. Like people will pay for convenience. Convenience 100%. So let me ask you about the wine. Yes, I'm kind of a wine connoisseur and I turned geo into one as well. We didn't get together and drink some wine. I have to say this because my friend Al will be very upset. We need to get together and drink wine. We must talk about that Eagles game. The Jets Eagles game that you played in 93 is talked about with me and my friends minimally once a month. That's how much we hate Eric Allen. Yeah, that was the Allen interception return. And there were two penalties on the return that should have been called. I'm aware and by the way, Johnny Mitchell to this day is one of them. My most favorite underrated Jets talents. That dude was talented. I love Johnny Mitchell. Yes. So much so in fact that my last year playing with him. Yes. On Saturday night, I would room with him. To make sure. To make sure he knew. He would play on Sunday. Well, I just wanted to make sure that he knew what he was doing on the field. Pure talent. Because there was times where I would drop back and I. He's supposed to be here. Right. But you know, this this is what's happening between Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelsi to push it forward to this Super Bowl. When I watch their tape, I'm not really sure what they're doing. I don't know how they are running their offense. I don't know what it seems like Travis is looking at something down the field and then reacting to it. And then Patrick reacting to him, which is like a telepathic way of doing things. Yes. I was one of these quarterbacks. I needed to know where my guys were going. Yeah. And I remember early when I started with Johnny Mitchell, who you're talking about was an incredible talent. Yes. He was going to throw a ball from the 50 yard line on his knee, right handed to the goal line and then go on the other knee and throw it left handed to the goal line. That's the kind of athlete he was. This is a tight end, by the way, for everybody's listening. Right. From Nebraska of all places. And he came out young. He did come out young. So I got him when he was really young. Yes. All right. So there were times where I call play and he was supposed to go down 12 yards and go out. Yes. Turn out to the sideline. Because we had a guy coming inside. It's concepts. I get it. And you know, break the field down and make the defenders have to jump on somebody. And then you have to try to anticipate what the defender is doing, depending on what your guys are doing. Yep. And about five times in a row, instead of going out, he would go in and he would go in because he didn't see anybody in there. And you know, he had a very funny voice and he'd come back in a huddle. He goes, Hey, booms, I was open. I was open. You've got to throw me the ball. And I'm like, Johnny, you can't go there because I'm not expecting you to be there. That's how talented he was. He used to like chop, block, go on the ground and then get back up and get open for you. He was ridiculous. How good he was. But, you know, unfortunately, it didn't last long enough. I know it didn't. And then, you know, that last year that I was here, Richie Kota was our coach and we did not have a tight end coach. Right. Because he, yeah, right. I don't know why we didn't have a tight end coach, but we didn't. And you know, he's going to be one of our more important players and we drafted Kyle Brady out of Penn State. I remember and did not take Warren Sapp and trust me, I remember. We're talking about Warren Sapp this morning. Yeah. I remember. I got a call actually had a good career. He had a very good career, but he wasn't a Hall of Famer like Warren Sapp. And we already had tight end. Yes, we did. So you were about to say that you're a wine connoisseur. You're Gary V. I'm sorry. I had to get just 30. It was great. It was legend. I had to get just a question. My favorite wine, right? And you is a sea smoke. I also like the Kistler brand. Do you like Costa Brown as well? I do. I cost the brown very much. I'm showing my jets and wine knowledge. I love this. Arista. Yep. No, well, so is this all available through you or now? Yeah. And as a matter of fact, you just named a lot of the higher in demand, which is why I jumped on Costa Brown. What we focus on is Santa Rita Hills and these places where you're buying these pinot from. There's a lot of $80, $90 pinot noir's in Sonoma and Russian River in Santa Rita and these places that you're buying from that aren't good at marketing, but the wine's remarkable. Yes, it is. So we're paying for the ratings and the demand. And so we're able to find $70, $80 pinot's and sell them for $29.99. I like that. That's exactly why WineText.com blew up. That is right. Man, I tell you, this guy knows what he's doing. Does he? I mean, he's not. Can I be on like once a week and talk about like nerdy jets things that have happened? I feel like a lot of the people that are listening, they like that. Oh, sure. Nerdy, nerdy jets. All you have to do is listen to the afternoon show. There's a lot of nerdy jets. I'm aware. I'm aware. Let's talk for jets for one more second. Offensive line, another receiver. I think, you know, obviously I kind of like this jet season coming in now because now everyone's razzing. Last year at the Super Bowl, everybody's hyping it. Are you going to get air and all this? Obviously all the hype. Now, everyone's like, even if everything looks good, I think America has learned how the jet stuff plays out. So I like a little bit more of the underdog thing. And I think they're not as far away because they've got a lot of pieces. They've just got to get that offensive line. I mean, their quarterback. And the quarterback makes the offensive line better. Of course. I will tell you that Patrick Mahomes has been brilliant through this playoff run. They don't have a great offensive line, but their offensive line has gotten better because they ran the ball. But if you notice, very few pre-snap penalties. And the reason for that is because the guy behind center is telling everybody. I know it. And that's hopefully what you're going to get from Aaron Rodgers. I've listened to both of you at nausea in the morning talk about, you know, number two and what his impact was on the offensive line. I've listened and listened and listened and look, it's real life stuff. And the reality is, Tim, it looks like he can play. Vera Tucker needs to stay healthy. But if he plays, those are two really good draft picks, by the way. Really good. People understand that. I agree. All they look is Mackay back then. They look at the other side. They can't seem to get somebody there. But you know, this happens to every team throughout the year. Rob Salah, where do you stand with your head coach right now? Very pro. You like Rob Salah. I do. He is too positive. He's not too positive. I'm not too positive. First of all, let's not forget Vayner Sports is a sports agency. My brother, AJ and I run. We rep DJ Reed and sauce Gardner. We rep Zonovan Knight, who was a running back a couple years ago. I'm on the inside. A lot of these dudes are my friends. Look, you know this, when things aren't working, I mean, look at how you guys talked about Brian on the giant side. He was a genius two years ago and people want him fired for Belichick this year. Yeah. I mean, it's a joke. Wow, that's not us. No, no, I listen to you. I listen to you. I know you do. I've heard. But I would say this going into this coming season. I'm aware. And I don't think they're much better than they were like two years ago when he first got here. You were the stink. Well, you could say that. You were the giant stink. All right, so, but now, let's be honest. So what happens? You were the giant stink. What happens? What happens if they have a bad year this coming year? When? What do you think is going to happen? I think there's going to be a lot of heat. And what is the giant fan or who is the giant fan going to want? They're going to want Belichick. Of course. But the giant ownership, and I hate to say it, it's a stable, strong, sitch there. And they're able to analyze if they've got good coaches or not. They've shown that in the past. They've had these weird runs where they've gotten a good one, a couple bad ones, a good one. Look, I think the guy can coach. But look, the giant stink. No, it's important to understand. They're not a good team. They're really not. And they have a year after a year. They have a lot of holes. They stink. Yep. I'm very passionate about the giant stink. I could say. I thought you were supposed to be positive. This is Pizarro Gary boomerang in Jetsland. I mean, if you guys, if there was film on how I acted at Jets games, there's a one jet stealer game. A 90 year old guy is coming up the stairs wearing a six time Super Bowl jacket. And the Jets stunningly beat the Steelers for no reason in a season that they didn't have a good season. And I yell at the guy, I'm like, hey, old man, you're finished. Right. And everybody kind of giggles or thinks it's a little weird because he's quite elderly. And then my brother looks at me and he goes, if people knew what you actually met, I wasn't even talking about the game. Like I get very bad. I'm a bad guy. I can't believe you're a shame. A guy of a football fan that is passionate like you are. Well, because I don't want, you know how the Steelers fans traveled boomer. Yes. They come to your stadium. They wave their flags. They're entitled. They I hate Steeler fans. Man. Hot take Gary V this morning. I'm ready for the NFL preview show. Let me know. Book me. It's just tremendous. All right. You got eight million things here going on here. So I'm going to have you because you're kind enough to show up so early. Yes. What else would you like to get out there that you were involved in? Honestly, honestly, it's Gary Vee on social media and every platform. I the reason I enjoy what I do is I was born in the Soviet Union. I grew up with nothing. We moved to Queens in a studio apartment half the size of your studio and live with seven eight family members. I'm just grateful. I'm just grateful. And so making content to show people angles right now. A lot of businesses listening should be posting on Facebook, but they think it's out of fashion, but it's got tons of organic reach, right? Telling people how to use LinkedIn because a lot of people listening right now don't love their job and they don't realize that if they posted 10 times on LinkedIn about what they know about their industry, they would have offers for new jobs paying them more. So I've got plenty of things that I'm passionate. Thank you for allowing me to talk about it. But my preference is to promote coming to consume some of this practical optimism. I'm not talking about delusion. It takes hard work. There's a lot of things you have to do, but I prefer that people think they can versus what's going on in society right now because they're pushing all this, all this noise of you can't Gary. It's great to see a great talk. We'll have you on again soon. Not believe you brought up that game. Bro, that game destroyed me. I'm not bringing that game. I'll tell you why that game's been brought up a lot. We were up 21. Nothing in that Eagles. I know we were. And we were two in one. Yes. And it felt like okay. And you guys had a good team. And that was an important game. That was a swing game. What are you doing to me? You realize I got to deal with him the rest of the day and now you have these terrible memories that you're bringing now. I didn't want to bring it up. Al texted me 39 times before coming on. He's like, please, can you just, like, it's important. This is like, we bring this game up. The first game of the football season this year will be out. Out of your body. Nine hour producer. No, no, no. And Ply is listening. They're all listening. They love you to death. And we got to talk about it. But the amazing thing is, is that it's really you that is here and not somebody else that Al thought was you. That's right. Al has trouble booking people. I booked the wrong Randy Moss. Did you know there's a Randy Moss talks about horse racing? Is this real? Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, the white Randy Moss. Yeah, I love the white Randy Moss. It's amazing. You got to watch the video. It's just, it's hilarious. I'm not watching. Live on the air. Realize you completely booked the white Randy Moss. Gary, thanks man. I appreciate it. Great to see you brother.
