This is going to be a big revolution in how you think about digital marketing. When you look at conversion rates in China for live streams, you see 10, 15, 20, sometimes 30% conversion as opposed to e-commerce in the United States where you usually see 2 to 5% conversion. Why? Because the social media companies know so much more about you, they can drop you in the live stream where your conversion rates likely to be really high. Plus, people like to buy from humans. And people like to buy from you. People like to buy from humans. And now what QBC didn't have at that now you have that you're doing these partnerships, wait, I can ask the person a question, they might answer it or somebody else might ask a question versus a banner ad versus an image that sends me to a landing page. Yeah. I mean, it is a different game. So I'm David Rolundson, I'm CEO of the QBC group. I've been in the position about three years. We were the original televised, the original combination of entertainment and shopping. We came up through linear television and cable and really invented impulse buying. And we think, like I think you think that we are on the edge of one of the biggest transformations of retail in a couple of decades. Maybe the biggest since the internet. By the way, I genuinely believe, I'm sorry to interrupt. No, you're good. But I launched an e-commerce wine website, wine retail site in 1997. And the second I started to understand what Amazon was doing in 95, I was like, this is it. Yeah, I actually convinced my father not to open a second liquor store. That's how much I believe that web and e-commerce would work. And nothing, nothing has happened since that is going to transform the retail landscape more than what we're about to talk about. Yeah, 100%. And that's 30 years now. I think that's right. And I think it's long overdue. It's time. It's a great idea. People have been talking about this for a long time now. They've been waiting for it. I think you can finally see it finally actually starting to break its scale. And so I think the next couple of years are going to be really exciting. So we've just pivoted the company announced a new strategy last year that we're renaming the company QBC group. We're renaming the tagline the live social shopping company. We signed a strategic partnership with Tick Tock shop earlier this year with the first 24 seven always on live shopping program on Tick Tock shop now. We're working across all the social media companies, but we're really going hard at Tick Tock shop. Yeah, because in at least in the western world outside of whatnot, Tick Tock shop are those are really the two quote unquote actual leaders. Can I ask you like, are you surprised, curious, anticipating like I've been waiting for YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter X. Do you think the other competitors in the social media landscape of Tick Tock are slow gathering their thoughts? Like, do you see any world in three years where those players are not involved in this? I know I threw like nine questions at you. No, no, no, it's good, but they're all they all have the same heart at the same heart at the question. The advantage of Tick Tock is that they are connected to China and they see it in China. They live it. They live it in China. So keep in mind in China, China, social shopping. Go ahead. Actually, I want you to say this because it's powerful. Yeah, social shopping in China is half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars. Just social shopping in China is larger than a lot of the GBP of a lot of economies around the world. Correct. And it's something like, depending on who you listen to, 40 to 50 percent of all e-commerce in China. And the U.S. social shopping is 6 percent of all e-commerce. And so we're way by the way, David, people just were stunned that it's that high. Like when you just said that, all the CEOs, all the CMOs, all the entrepreneurs, all the creators, all the influencers, and again, you and I, like all of us, you know, whether it's 6 percent or 4 percent, these reports can be a little right. But people do not even realize how big it is in the U.S. right now. This second. That's exactly right. And it's growing very fast. By the nanosecond. It's growing very fast. So I think the best estimate suggests it's about 70 billion a day. It'll be 140 billion in less than five years. It was 70 billion in 23. It should be 140 billion in something like 28. Mike's doing his first live show. He opened up his mouth during one of my shows this week. And now I'm forcing him. He's literally, he's doing a garage sale. How'd you do? Oh, he's doing it tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Or he's fired. This is big. No, I'm not kidding, David. I need to know your numbers. I need to know your numbers. What are we selling? What are we selling? Is that what you're doing? You have enough? Lay around? But you have to do me a favor. Please throw some random stuff because actually, please, like a hat, like a coat, like a golf club. I actually believe that this is so big that is going to, and this is tough for me because I grew up garage selling and food marketing, but I believe in four to five years, like the garage sale is going to happen on live social shopping. You're literally going to be in your living room. You're like, how about this curtain? Like people are going to be with a phone. Be like, what do you want for my house? And I'm going to be like that lamp. I'm like, all right, the lamp is up for sale, 13, 25, like this is profound. This is going to create economics that don't exist yet. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah, I agree with that. And so we think this is the next big thing in shopping. We think it's about to transform shopping to go back to your point. So TikTok is tied into the Chinese ecosystem so they understand where all of this is going. And so I think it's helped them get conviction faster. But don't you think if you and I are smart enough because we know what's going on in China, wouldn't you like to think that Mark Zuckerberg and Linda and Ilan over, like, they know it's happening? Yeah. Are you, I guess it's a very simple question. Are you surprised that Metta has not put out harder push in Q1, Q2 of this year, given how last year went? Or do you not even think about things like that? No, I think I'm shocked. How about that? We do a lot of business with Metta. We have a great partnership with them. Me too. And we're working with them on social shopping as well. I think TikTok has deeper conviction earlier because they lived it earlier. I think eventually everybody will get there because it's going to be the biggest opportunity on the board for every social media company over the next couple of decades. And so everybody's going to be there. Everybody's going to figure out how to play. I think there are a lot of opportunities in front of big opportunities in front of all of the social media companies right now. What's AI going to mean? What's the advertising market? You're being smart. By the way, the reason I think some people are slow to this right now is the AI combo is so important. I agree with that. And it sucked up the oxygen for some of that. I totally agree with that. By the way, back to shopping, this gets into commerce land. Amazon, Walmart, eBay all have smoke, no fire yet, but all have smoke around this live social shopping thing. That's absolutely right. That's absolutely right. I think what's different and I think what's really good about what you're doing and I think is it's not just... So everybody has a piece of it. What QVC figured out a long time ago that nobody's really quite tried to figure out yet in social. And I think it's one of the reasons that social shopping is taking longer to take off in the United States is you actually have to build a full value proposition. Right? So you have to generate the content, yes, but you also have to build a merchandising function. So you have all the products. QVC sells 400,000 products a year. So we have all the products that you need. But then you got to get the products and people's hands. So we ship 200 million boxes a year and you have to get it in their hands. And then once it's in their hands, sometimes they're problems. They want to return it. Who do they return it to? They want to call somebody to find out where the product is. Who do they call? Do you have call centers for them to talk to? Right? So it goes... People think about the front end or the back end. They have a product they want to sell or they have social media and they think they have the eyeballs. You need the eyeballs. You need the personalities who will bring those eyeballs in and then they have to be matched to the right product. You need the... I mean where you have always been... I mean, I've been fascinated about this my whole life. Literally. I mean, obviously I've been in business feels like my whole life. You need to have the analytics and the data. You need the analytics and the data. When I was like 20, I guess, so I guess it's 30 years ago, when I found out that at QVC, when you would go on... My whole life, I thought I would be on QVC. I will crush. Never say never. What do you think you're doing here, David? What do you think you're doing? But really, this is no... I think you're gonna like this, David. My whole life, I'm like one day... Like, I just think about these things in my life. I just... I'm built for it. You are built for QVC. And this is why I knew this 30 years ago. Maybe this is a recruiting call. We thought it was a podcast. I've been talking to some of your... I've been talking to some of your execs 30 years ago. I was like, wait, they have data that shows that you're good? Like three seconds in, they're like, uh, this person's not gonna be good. I've been... I mean, what today? The best internet companies in the world. Like, TikTok itself does not... Who's very advanced at this, does not even have the stack that you guys have of people coming on and you're like, yep. And you're like, oh, Johnny, we're gonna have him on every eight weeks because he's got it. It's a big deal. And to your point, you know, it's very funny. So V-Friends, my... So I believe in horizontal and vertical for intellectual property when it comes to consumable goods, meaning I will license out my... So I'm trying to build a Pokemon Marvel world. Obviously, what you're looking at is Top Scrum. That's a licensing deal with Fanatics and Michael Rubin and Tops because I can't do trading cards like they can. I can't get that distribution. Yeah. But comic books... Rubin's a great guy. Great. But comic books, here we go. But comic books, I'm actually selling direct to consumer on live social shopping. Yeah. And the reason... You just talked about the most important part. Because I built an e-commerce business in 1996 and still run one, the number one thing I invested in first was customer service. Very smart. Very smart. While in parallel, building up supply chain. Right. And then finally, I gave enough shits about who's gonna be on and sell it. What the... And so to your point, that middle. Yeah. Because everyone's like content, product, selling. That middle is the whole game. Yeah. That's exactly right. It's gonna be a massive differentiator. That's exactly right. And so... But I think we're finally... I think like with our partnership with TikTok, we're finally... Other people coming into the ecosystem, we're finally building the ecosystem. And I think once the ecosystem gets built, it's going to be the best way of shopping. 100%. Everybody's already on social. Correct. Everybody's already doing some purchasing on social. Correct. If you look at who's winning in retail now, you basically have a couple of big winners. You have sort of algorithmic, big e-commerce engines that feel very impersonal, that are selling your eyeballs. It's an efficient way to shop, but it's not a joyful way to shop. You have really big box retailers. You're walking on concrete floors. You have self-checkout. It's a very efficient way to shop. It's not a joyful way to shop. Neither one of them has connection or trust. Neither one of them are terribly human. And neither one of them are great for impulse and discovery. No, they're... Social's gonna solve that. That's right. They're good for convenience and price. That's exactly right. Which are absolute elements of shopping. That's exactly right. But boy, when you start getting into commerce attainment, when you underst... I believe that most of... This has been the most interesting. And you, you at QVC probably really knew this. I knew many things about QVC. This was not something on my radar until living the last three years of social shopping and the last year where it's really become it. It is stunning to me how many people buy something as a subconscious tip to the host. There is no doubt about it. That is... But by the way, for you and I, that's real. When I tell you 99% of the smart people that are listening to this podcast about this, do not know this yet. I am watching on my stuff. And I'm not even talking about when I'm the host, even my teammates. But obviously, when I'm the host, given... You know, it's funny how life works. You give and you get. But I can definitely feel it when I'm on that people are just buying just to support me because I've given them so much. But I'm watching kids that I hire for the first time do a show and because they're funny or clever or they're working hard, I can feel it through the screen that there's someone who's like, I'm going to buy this because this person made me laugh. No different than paying 400 bucks to go see a fancy comedy stand-up show here in Madison Square Garden. When you are entertained, you are accustomed to pay for that. This commerce payment thing that they were... Back to what you were talking about, a Walmart or a Target or a Costco or an Amazon is not providing that. They are dominant on convenience and price and that will continue to keep them very much in business. They will try to get into what we're talking about here. Everybody will. But man, it is real, that commerce payment thing. And I will say one of the things we know about American society right now is it's getting a lot lonelier. People have fewer friendships, fewer marriages, fewer best friends. And so a lot of where people go for human connection is through these digital platforms, including especially the social platforms. That's why they're called social platforms. And when people are engaging in those social platforms, they're bringing a lot of themselves to it. And so if you're creating a real connection on that social platform, people want to contribute. They want to interact. They want to have a connection. They feel like you're there with them in a real way. They know you're not, but they feel it in a real way. And if the way you give them to participate is through retail, that's fine. Sometimes it's because of the product, but a lot of times it's because it's their way to participate in this social moment that they're experiencing. I completely agree. By the way, it's disproportionately the most exciting thing I see from afar that you're about to activate. You've had an enormous community that has not been able to be connected with each other given the medium of television. That's right. You're about to have them all. When I tell you that half the people that show up when I go live are there to be with each other. And I think it's even higher that just hurts my feelings that it's that high. They are fully engaged. Now, we also have, you know, and again, I'm saying this out loud to tell you how I'm doing it. So, all of you create your version of it. We have a real good thing going because our literal thing is called V-Friends. And our tagline before live social shopping four years ago is strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends and friends become family. And so that's been our ethos. So, that's why we, you know, when I launched V-Friends, it was an NFT, but it had utility. It was actually a ticket to a once a year over three year period super conference that was held in the Colt Stadium, the Viking Stadium, and then in LA Live, like a real ticket. Yeah. And because it was friends. It was, I was building the characters as friends and competitors. There's a lot of deep modern parenting stuff I'm trying to accomplish. And I wanted the people that collected them to be friends. This live social shopping thing has taken it to the stratosphere. So, you're absolutely right. Yeah. That's awesome. How do you, let me, let me take this opportunity. This show is consumed by an extraordinary amount of Gen Z, even Gen Alpha, like and obviously young millennials. How does QVC start to win the hearts and minds of that generation? I'm sure that's got to be a real topic on your mind. Yeah. So, we've always been centered on sort of a woman as she goes into her 30s, 40s, 50s, comes into more discretionary income, has more discretionary time, tends to want to, after she's been very focused often on family and friends and others, now gets a little more focused on herself as willing to treat yourself, as willing to invest in herself, and is also investing in other buying for family, friends, that sort of thing. So, we love that customer. Absolutely love that customer. Everybody else can chase younger. We love that customer. We're going to stay with that customer. We think that disproportionately, these women who have raised the family are deeply involved in their community are for no fee, holding up the non-profits that serve the people in need in those communities. I could not agree with that. We think that woman is a hero that the world underserves and we're really happy to serve her. So, we will not walk away. We will not walk away from her. That said, but it's an end game, right? It's an end game. That said, and so, what we're finding is that a lot of things we sell on social media, everybody wants. It works for everybody, right? The electronics and iPad works for everybody. A KitchenAid mixer works for everybody. And we're working with so many influencers. So, we are actively today, either in conversations, are actively working with 85,000 influencers across social media. Incredible. And so, you get to take advantage of all of their fans, all of their followers, and so, you're dipping into their audience. And so, what we're finding is we are naturally expanding our demographic as we are working with lots of followers, or sorry, working with lots of influencers and creators who are bringing their own audiences. And so, we will expand naturally as part of this strategy. What's something, let me give you the floor a little bit. What's something we have not talked about that you think would bring value? I have a funny feeling this podcast can be consumed by a lot of people that are looking at this space given the nature of who you and I are and the moment we're in right now. What have we not talked about that you find interesting? What do you want people to know either in the macro because you enjoy the thinking process of all this or in the micro? Something that's going on in QVC Group. What have we not touched on that is a good addition to this conversation as an aha or a watch out or a fun tidbit? Yeah. So, the thing we've not touched on in this conversation that I find interesting is your relationship with Bojangles. Because I know you're not from the Carolina. I know you're not from the Carolina. You cannot comprehend what Bojangles means. And you know it's funny. It's a story similar to and I joined that board for many reasons. One, I keep doing things to set up my interests, my learnings, my contributions and you know from like all from a selfless kind of standpoint and then from a selfish standpoint I want to be the most Swiss Army knife operator of all time. I'm really thinking those terms. But I also realize I have strengths and weaknesses. I like to go to places where inherently I have strengths. Yeah. It is very clear to me. I mean this is funny. This is the second time I bring it up. Truly, truly. I wish we had a common friend that knew both of us our whole lives. Truly, when I was 18, 19, 20, I would walk around life and be like I'm going to be on QVC one day. In the same way probably about what am I 49? Probably about 20 years ago I'm like oh shit. I have the personality and operational type that would be really great at launching a substantial SaaS business or a QSR or just a macro franchisee, franchisee or business. So I've spent a lot of time investing in SaaS businesses and then I joined the board of a QSR that was on and this is very specific. I had other opportunities but Bojangles was at a point where it was ready to double down and win bigger in the south but was ready for the first time ever to expand out west and up north. And so it's been a great journey. Yeah. And I wish, you know, listen, everybody's got their thoughts on eating and foods and I'm kind of like nothing is black and white. It's all little gray. I think some indulgence would do a lot of people some good. Occasional indulgence I think is right. You know, because I'm on the board I've had to really go deep on every version of every kind of fast food competitor things of nature. Bojo does good food. We do a lot of things not as well as I'd like and we're building and building and building. But like it kind of goes back to the essence of QVC like and any other great iconic company. When you do a couple of things real well, it always gives you a fighter's chance to adjust to the things that maybe you missed or are changing on you. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. So a more serious answer. I would say we just think we're out of moment. Right. If you look at linear television, this year will probably be the first year that streaming viewership will surpass linear television viewership. Last year was the first year that digital advertising surpassed linear television advertising. And so you're seeing this transition from linear television viewership to streaming real time, this complete transformation. Same thing is going to happen in retail. We sit between sort of retail and entertainment and shopping. And so we're seeing this on the streaming side by the way we built a very fast growth streaming business. Our monthly active users are up 100% year over year. Where can people see that? You can see it at QVC plus, HSN plus, Apple TV, whatever your platform is. Right. You download the app. So QVC and HSN plus. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And so we're about to see the same amount of disruption in retail. It's coming. It's been building. I think we're finally at the moment. Like you said, I think TikTok shop is the first real social media platform to show people 100% sort of show people the way. Last thing I'll say, because I know you have a lot of people who talk, who think about marketing and digital marketing and things like that. This is going to be a big revolution in how you think about digital marketing. When you look at conversion rates in China for live streams, you see 10, 15, 20, sometimes 30% conversion as opposed to e-commerce in the United States where you usually see two to five percent conversion. Why? Because the social media companies know so much more about you. They can drop you in the live stream where your conversion rates likely to be really high. Plus, I'm sorry, but I like to jam. I'm more like a, like if I was a musician, I'd like to jump in and start playing my saxophone. Plus, people like to buy from humans. And people like to buy from humans. 100%. People like to buy from humans. This is something you know better than anyone. Like literally I'd rather buy from someone talk. And now what QVC didn't have that live social happens, that now you have that you're doing these partnerships. Wait, I can ask the person a question. They might answer it or somebody else might ask a similar. It is versus a banner ad versus a image that sends me to a landing page. I mean, it is a different game. So it's going to change. It's going to change retail digital marketing. It's going to change shopping. It's coming. I think it's a big opportunity. We believe we're pivoting the company there. We believe it's a massive opportunity. You've been all over it. I think you've probably been as big a public voice trying to get out in front of this and get people to see the opportunity as anybody. And by the way, I think we're going to win. I want a lot of people to win. I think we need to build the whole ecosystem. You're smart enough to know that's what's going to happen. Yeah. There's going and what I get excited about, I play a very funny role. I live with the creator, small entrepreneur, all the way to Fortune 50. I wanted both for people like yourself, like the biggest incumbents, but I want it for people like Mike. Yeah, that's right. And I've got a new one for you, Mike. But let me say this. You'll find this interesting. Here's a real tidbit. I think the million, excuse me, the hundreds of millions of people that are trying to become influencers. I mean, every single kid in the world that's 16 has one agenda professionally. I would like to be an influencer. Yeah. Because I just want to live my life and get as much money as possible. I believe that millions of people right now listening, hopefully over a decade, that many will listen, but like millions of people that potentially could hear this are aiming to be an influencer, but do not have the talent. This is unfortunately like something that has to be said. But if they pivoted to be a social commerce person, that their destiny, trying to be an influencer and getting brand deals and all that only caps at 8,000 a year. Not the millions they dream of. If they took their same talents and decided to go all in on live shopping, I think they make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, that long tail of when you're going to be battling it out with the Ebay's and the Amazon's and the like you've got your 30 to 50 that you're going to be playing with. The long tail of it. The fact that there's, you know, that's actually what it's a much more direct monetization. Of course. So that's going to be interesting. My friend, this was fun. A lot of fun. Take care of yourself.
