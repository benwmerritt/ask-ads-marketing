If I go down one direction, you miss out on another thing. Can I give you some really, really good news? No matter what you ever decide, you'll never know if the other thing would have been anything. Sitting around and debating which option's better will never show you which option was better. I passed on investing in Uber from one of my best friends, twice. Had I made a normal $25,000 investment like I was doing at the time, I would have made somewhere close to the f***. I day-trade attention and build businesses. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Like, documented. Just doing it's not enough. You gotta do it right. Meaning I wouldn't do it if I was gonna mail it in, because I'm gonna leave a bad impression. And that's a waste of, you know, energy on both sides. And so, you know, this is just a clip to wrap up the day. The reality is I'm f***ing exhausted at this point. I think there's a format. I think it's this. I mean, both of those were bangers. I can easily do that at bed at midnight, or like the next day. I think it just makes it very compelling content. And maybe we can do a visual where it looks like audio and like give it a brand, like Gary's Recap, or deeper insight. Let's go even triple meta. Hey everyone, what you're watching now is how we do it. You're watching the f***ing pasta being made right now. If you've noticed, I've started talking about being good at the craft, more pack. I think I'm gonna leave a deeper to detail. Well, do you think about the first three seconds and the thumbnail, like starting to go a little further? It's like, okay, it's established. You gotta make a f*** a little content. Now, I think I can get more. And so everyone will be watching right now. That's what this is. Like Sidney Litchie, I'm just like, you just watch the packy and it's like a releasing show. We're in Sidney now in the morning. Pretty excited. Feel really fresh. Not that much sleep, but kind of like speaks to being overall rested, cut down on travel, post COVID on things that I need to do. And I think it's adding up. Like there's been many flights this year that I did not take that I could have in the past. I feel like I've banked that rest. And so for times like this, when I have to go hard and that, you know, sometimes you get balance in extremities. It's not like balancing every day. It's okay with being lazy for a month and it's okay with going super hard for a month. You've got to time it. That's life. You f***ing dominate the day. I ain't holding on to anything, dragging me down. Wake up in the AMC, I'm praying that I leave out. Make sure when it comes to us. When I come into markets, for everybody who's watching the vlog, I like to get together with senior marketers and shoot the shit, just jam. So we've been talking about like the changing landscape. For a lot of you that are watching, you believe in social media marketing, but you'd be surprised how many people still think a television ad is a better way to sell shit. You couldn't believe how fun it is to Sidney's rooms and talk about innovation, AI, influencer marketing. Thumbnails, reels, creative strategies. Plus I love hearing perspectives of people that see it differently than me. And really going back and forth, it's almost like battle rap meets a jam session, meets like a dead poet society. Like I get to meet people, I get to know people better. Some of my favorite stuff to do and as you can see throughout this week's vlogs, I'm just doing a lot of it. A lot of sessions, a lot of jamming, getting to know people. I'm enjoying it. This is fun. You know, team, I think there's a lot of things running through my mind. It's really good to see you. I want to be the best in the world at sock, cause sock is the answer to where this is all gonna go. You have so much permission here to win. We've got to push ourselves. One of the biggest challenges that we face is getting that quantity going through without the strenuous approvals process on there. I'm hoping that's gonna ease up a little bit more. Let me jump in real quick. You know when I talk about like use me, do you understand that if I just stay up to like nine o'clock one day, get on Zoom and speak with the client, I can change that. They may decide to take a swing at it, they may not. When I'm like email me, everyone's like, but I don't want to upset my boss. It's just not how it works here. Cause it's not bad, it's making it good. The more I can make them realize that's how much I'm gonna be involved, the more they'll do it themselves. I'd rather you guys and gals go out and make it and it get never approved just for you to get the reps of making good CCs, but you're making it cause you think it's gonna get approved. That's not interesting to me. Make that and the shit that you think is fire. Let them say no, I need you to get these kind of reps because it's all gonna get approved eventually. You understand? Thank you. Thank you. Take a sip of your Coke, tell me the parts. I ain't combined with the pros, I came to talk. Snubbing most cheese, cracks, the parks. Digitivity, hitting the bottom, the boo cars. You've been sniffing mirrors, torturing the local town. I made excuses for you too many times. Hello. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I just appreciate all of you being here. It's like super fun to travel around the world and see what people are up to, make connections, make relationships. I know you talk a lot about regret and mindset and stuff. Like is it personally or right? Like I'm content. Is it okay just being okay if you're happy with okay? Or do you think it's- I think it's the ultimate piece- You're in a society where they're constantly pushing, like make more money, earn more money, status. I don't- If you're personally happy, you think that's all that- It's, I mean, of course. I'm a businessman and I love business, but I think it's crazy to chase money. As a singular KPI, I'm so at peace at all times and I'm desperate to find ways to communicate. If you're achieving what you're talking about, you've won. Like to me, waking up with anxiety is like devastating. I know you know it's okay, right? I gotta go. Okay. Pleasure. Thank you. I'll see you out there. All right, singing and you bringing me up standing on your feet and make surprise. Sing and you're gonna move like you're a baby. Pleasure. I'm a baby. Pleasure. Pleasure. Pleasure. Sydney, what's good? Pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. So happy to be here. I think people burn out because they're not doing their thing. A lot of people fail because they talk about shit they think money will be in. But you don't need to be an expert. You're the expert of your life experiences. You can talk about anything. I'd highly recommend talking about stuff that you're interested in because it becomes sustainable. If you ask me to hang a picture right now on a wall, I'd be burned out by the time I got to the hammer. That's not my thing. I don't want to do that shit. Right? Like I'm exhausted. I can work 19 hours a day. I can literally do this in front of this audience for the next 48 hours straight and not sleep. You ask me to go walk a dog. I'll be sleeping within the first second. Let's hear the words you would say. Yeah, you guys ready? Woo! All right, you spoke about loving your life. Loving your life. Yes. And you spoke about a whole lot of people that don't love their life. Yes. When did you start loving your life? I started loving my life fully the day I was done with school. So I would say, yeah, I'm being serious. Like school was a burden on me and I hated it and it took up a lot of time. My bigger question to you is, what's making you not love your life? It's a great question. So answer it. Not achieving. Not achieving what I think that I can achieve. For whom? For me. Why are you doing that to yourself? I think that I'm capable of more than one thing. So it's a matter of, do I go in this direction? Do I go in that direction? But what are you scared of that's not letting you make decisions? Missing out. On what? On the other things that if I go down one direction, you miss out on another thing. Can I give you some really, really good news? No matter what you ever decide, you'll never know if the other thing would have been anything. Sitting around and debating which option's better will never show you which option was better. I passed on investing in Uber from one of my best friends, twice. Had I made a normal $25,000 investment like I was doing at the time, I would have made somewhere close to $500 million. The reason it doesn't even sit with me is I also know how I've done that. My life would have been completely different. I believe that you're scared to lose. That's why you're not doing anything and that it feels better to make pretend you're capable instead of seeing if you're capable. You're protecting yourself. You gotta practice losing, my man. Instead of making pretend you won't lose. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Ladies and gentlemen, Gary Vandesdaaf. Thank you, Sidney. Thank you so much. Get home safe. That was some great stuff, huh? I'm sorry, man. It took a long time to lock you, man. But fuck. I'm sorry, God. Honestly, you know what? I hate it because you said real and I wasn't. I'm just poking at you. I get it. I get it. Bye-bye, everyone. I'll see you tomorrow. Yo, brother. Of course, my brother. Thank you. I hope you enjoyed. I consume your content and I feel just grateful. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so grateful. I came from Costa Rica and I really appreciate it, bro. I love you, brother. Good luck to you. Thank you. You're welcome. I guess he's ready to go as well, so let's introduce him. I'm gonna win. Please give a warm welcome, as he makes his way to the stage. It's Gary V. Woo! Thank you. How would you break a brand new artist if they were under your agency? By only signing artists who prove they know how to market. Most of these artists are equally creators. The A&R business has changed quite a bit. You don't need to go to the bars at two in the morning and find them. You just go to the social platforms and see it. It's very clear which artists understand how to be creatives. I wouldn't take the risk of signing an artist just on the quality of the music. There's too many people with quality music and some of them also know how to create creative for the platforms that have the end consumer's attention. And then once you have that, the artist is doing the work. You can build infrastructure around them, but they're native to the understanding of how to create. Lil Nas X is a growth hacker. He was going at that for a while. Lil Nas X is more Mr. Beast than he is Kanye West. And that is a blueprint to where this is going. Gary, I think I speak for everyone that billion dollars in this room. I'm gonna say a huge thank you. So everyone give Gary a round of applause. Thank you. Where's the camera? You ready? I'm just fucking exhausted. That's how I'm ending it. See ya.
