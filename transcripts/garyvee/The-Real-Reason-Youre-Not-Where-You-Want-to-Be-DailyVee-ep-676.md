And that's how kids learn not mommy and daddy are gonna protect you and then you send them into the big bad real world at 22 years old and they're straight crying about everything at their job and society, blaming Trump and Biden, blaming mommy and daddy, blaming the bosses and walking around being straight. Period. Clip that. What's up legend? Such a pleasure. Yeah, so how's it going? How you feeling? Good. Life is good? Good. I see that, I'm proud of you, bro. You doing a nice job. Gary Vee, OG, Zach Moone. I was gonna center this daily video with a parenting, just doing that with a homie. We just did a lot of talking about it and the podcast we just went through. If you had to pick on one or two that were directly correlated with like, you know how you view a parent and how you just grant them your general views. Probably, he's not in the set. He's gonna be a next year set, but self-aware hair. I think parenting, you being self-aware and teaching your kids what self-awareness means, which leads me to my next one. In this set, accountable aunt Eater is in this set. I think accountability, that's what my whole big rant was at the end. I believe the number one mistake a father or mother can do for a daughter and son in competition is let them win. And when I say number one, I mean number one. There is a very specific reason that society is now littered with children contemplating suicide. Kids anxious, every kid talking about depression. We have over coddled the fuck out of a generation. We made these kids soft. We gave them eight-place trophies. We stopped punishing them. We stopped grounding them. When you teach a kid that winning and losing doesn't matter, it teaches indifference. Indifference means nothing matters. Nothing matters, leads to my life doesn't matter. I do not understand how people do not see what is going on. This is dangerous. We fucked the kids up. Stop coddling these kids. And I think we lost our way. And I think an entire generation of parents overreacted to the hardships of their. And it's hard. It's hard to find that middle. But when you over coddle, it's game over. Thank you, my guy. Yo. What up, what up? Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you guys so much for coming. Thank you so much. Sup, sup, sup. How you doing? I'm well, I'm well. It's great to see you. All right, all right, all right. Hi, hi, hi. How you doing, man? You know, this is, you know this, and I'm going to give some flowers. This is a card shop that I visit when I'm with my son on spring break. Yeah, that was a great. So this is a go-to for us. So to me, even though I don't live down here, when I'm down here visiting my parents, when they're down here, this is a local card shop for me. Yeah. So probably the best part is the warm feelings. It's not like some of the rest of my tour where I've never been to the store before. I'm here for a community. This was a little selfish and selfless. You know, I root for you. Thank you. You know, obviously it's a couple of weeks into the launch. The product has been massively successful. People are happy. And it was just nice to see some people again for the sixth time or third time. And it was really nice to see some people for the first time that I've been interacting with for seven or eight years on social media. It makes every one of my appearances kind of special. Almost 20 years now, I've had a public persona. Yeah. And I'm meeting people sometimes for the first time that I've talked to 100 times over 17 years. Yeah. That's incredibly special. So thank you for that opportunity. Thanks, I know you look. How are you? Yes, the year goes. I love that. We're missing our senior award. Let's go. This is what matters. That's amazing. I gotta get it. Oh, yeah. Let's go. Amen. Thank you so much. Catch you brother. Who needs really? Yeah, of course. Ready? I'm not just starting a business. I'm consistent. He's called it just game. For 50% of kids it is. If you are an entrepreneur or you're creative and not or and you collect debt because mommy and daddy are not going to pay for it. You cannot go to college. If nothing else, I'm consistent. That's what's up. That's what's up. Always. Take care. Stay well. No worries. That's what's up, Gary. That's what's up, brother. Thanks so much. We just pulled the game on. Jesus Christ. You got to rip it off. I'm not going to bombard him. I will sign every card from that pack. This pack. Nope. This pack right here. Open it right now. That's not a bad one. Let's get a black cat. Let's go. Ooh, heart trooper. Common sense cow. Get inside. I like a good common sense cow. Skilled skeleton. And signed. Sneak mine and Stevie. And a radical rabbit getting signed. It's really been rewarding and I'm very humbled by the support and the turnout. I think parents have been really happy. I've gotten thousands. That's a lot. Yeah, I mean the product's been out for a week. Thousands of parents that are like, hey, I really want my kids to collect this. People that don't even know who Gary Vee is, like random emails already. Just discovered this at my local card store. Kids got attracted to the packaging. We bought a pack. I turned it around. I had no idea there were such positive messages. I can get behind this. So I think we got a lot of things going in our direction. My brother. I appreciate it. These friends gave me a connection that I just got married. Just my steps and I'm trying to find a bonding thing. And this is it. And friends hate. Thank you for that. That makes me so happy. What about you? Chad, I love you all. Best, best, best evening. Love you all. Thank you so much. Love you guys. Stay well. Thank you for having me for real. Thank you. Good to see you. Of course. Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming out. Thank you again for all your advice. Thanks for being here. Want me to wrap this up for you? Yeah, let's just leave that right here. You've been filming? So you see what Stefan does, right? This is how he leaves me. But it's true. It's true. It was a great experience. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. It's true. It was really great to be with you. I missed you, bro. I'm so proud of you. Great to see you become such a great man. It's nice, even though we fucked up. Show them that part when we got scared. What's up, man? Stefan? You forgot about that part? You gotta keep me on. Me and Stefan were a little rusty on our communication and kind of got our, I was on some heaters in the podcast, so fucking 30 minutes away sucks. Clip in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're like 40 minutes late. We don't normally do that. It's really good day. Obviously, first day back last week was crazy. Haven't been sick in forever. But man makes plan. God laughs. I probably needed the rest. I've been going so hard for the last 100 days. But great day in Florida. I felt very fresh, fully back, which feels amazing. I was super pent up to get a lot done. The three hours on the flight, I was crazy. I got three weeks worth of work done. Did a great podcast. And then obviously a great appearance at the store. Lots of smiley faces. Lots of good vibes. Always great to reconnect with old friends like Stefan. And I think it's a great solid daily V that will have some good stories to it. And I'm sure Stefan will post it real proper. So hope you enjoy the episode. And now on to Nashville. You're the only guy I know that's out there pitching positivity, optimism and love. In a crazy world. I'm really trying. I'm trying to get more people to jump on this bandwagon with me. I appreciate what you do as well. I think we need more people pushing love. I don't know what else to say. I think it's super lazy to push hate. I'm really not impressed by people out there spewing negativity, leaving negative comments. Like I really, I genuinely am not impressed and I'm genuinely empathetic. I feel bad for them. The concept of going around the internet and leaving comments to hurt other people's feelings is fucking miserable. Yep, it's crazy.
