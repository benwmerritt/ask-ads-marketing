But the problem is, a lot of people have struggled with failing in front of everyone. When you're not built for it, and then all of a sudden you go for it, and then it fails, that's failure in front of everyone. And the one reason that most people don't do entrepreneurship is they do fear failure. Attention is the number one asset. Tell me your story, how you moved here and immigrated here in 1978? Yes, I convinced my parents when I was three years old to immigrate from the USSR. I love her so much, by the way. His hat is cheap. Yeah, mom and dad are in the building. Yeah, I mean, honestly, it's a very classic story. There's lots and lots and lots and lots of people on earth that have that incredible, fortunate scenario to come to this remarkable country from another place. For me, which I think is a little more rare, I had really exceptional parents. So it was this perfect storm of right place, right time, right circumstance. When I analyze my life and when I look at many others, and really for the many in here, which I appreciate the comments, but I know a lot of people here don't know who I am or don't know the depths of my story. Really at the end of the day, I'm incredibly interested in people. One thing that's just become more and more obvious to me is I like people more than most people. Genuinely, even wanting to go out in the cocktail hour and talk to people instead of just being in my green room, that's just who I am. That's who I was born from day one to be. And I was able to really hone it over time. I think practice matters. Every time I say practice, I hear Alan Iverson practice and I understand what he was saying, but for me, it's the reverse. A lot of people ask me about my entrepreneurial career. I'm 47 years old and I've been practicing for over 40 years. For me, it was the only thing I did. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this in this setting, but I was an atrocious student. And it was because I was pot committed. Long before people said go all in or be passionate, there was a level of self-awareness. There was a level of self-belief. There was a level of not willing to compromise. There was something that was inside of me that understood who I was. I just really understood it. I wasn't gonna apologize for it. I was definitely not interested in doing anything bad. I was just looking to be fully myself. And I think a lot of luck with DNA, a lot of luck with circumstance, and I think it was a perfect storm. Even the era that I'm growing up in. What is very clear to me is that I have a very strong knack for understanding attention. I just have always understood it. Even when I was doing lemonade stands, when I was six, seven years old, back to practicing for 40 years, I was more interested in the signs and where I was gonna put the signs to get people to buy the lemonade than the lemonade. Then even the money. I was more interested in the attention than the money. So, look, I'm 47 years old. The explosion of the internet happened just as I was ready to go into the real world. That's just a little bit of a luck of the draw. Sure, I can decide that I would have been a good newspaper man or a radio man or a TV man if I was born two generations earlier. But in all those scenarios, there are gatekeepers. There are gatekeepers, the internet, and social media. And the reason this is such a big deal and whether you think it's awesome or you think it's bad, there's so much that goes along with it. What everyone's struggling with is nobody's in control. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, these platforms are empty. There's no editor in chief. There's no head of the studio. This is not a subjective opinion. It's merit. Who's the human could put in the work, put in the message that most attracts people's attention. And we judge, we judge in this room and the world who people pay attention to, but that's silly. That's you judging clear data that supports that other people find XYZ interesting. We all have different interests. We all think different things are interesting. So I think the story of me is I'm very fortunate. And that's why I'm incredibly driven by gratitude. I'm a very simple dude who's doing a lot. I think when people look at me from the outside, I have 700 trillion businesses. I'm putting out content 58 times a day. I'm always up to something, but in reality, I think I'm incredibly simple, which is I keep life very basic. I'm not doing it for the accolades or the trophies. I'm humbled by it. I'm humbled to take a selfie, but it's not what I strive for. I don't need that. My parents took care of my self-esteem. So I'm good. I'm just living my life. And at this point, I'm just trying to, there's even a part of, there's probably a level of guilt that is a currency inside of me that it worked so well for me. That mix between gratitude and guilt inspires me very heavily to try to give an ounce to the world what's inside of me. And so that's how I roll. Trying to get a sense of a little Gary, right? Little Gary, eight, nine, 10 years old, you know, you had an entrepreneurial spirit from a very young age who started lemonade, snack. But what, and then going into high school, what stereotype bucket did you fit in? Well, maybe not. Were you the jock? Were you the nerd? Were you the braniac? Were you the Romeo? Were you the, I don't know, tell me a little bit about it. I think that fits you for us a little more. I think, you know, this now makes sense to me when I'm older. I think I have an unusual outcome because I think it was a little bit interesting. Like, you know, right around fourth or fifth grade from the jock standpoint was when I transitioned from wanting to be on the New York Jets to thinking about buying them. So, up first, that was about 10, 11, about 12, because you know, seven, eight, nine, I have such remarkable hand-eye coordination that I was able to dominate first and second grade. But somewhere around fourth and fifth grade, this things changed a little bit. You had to actually be strong and fast and athletic and all these other things. Like, uh-oh, this might be a problem. I was really a bad student. Like, you know, by fourth grade, I know mom, I had to actually pass my high school to send me the report card because my mom changed the story and her mom and her mind and decided I was a C student. But by fourth and fifth grade, I started getting a lot of Ds and Fs. And that was actually extremely challenging. You know, I had a lot of teachers and a lot of my friends' parents really communicate to me in an incredibly negative way because of my grades, right? Like, I remember, you know, for the people over 45, you might remember this for the kids, this might be a reference that doesn't land. But for some reason, in the late 80s, early 90s, the way they tried to scare you, and I feel terrible for people in the sanitation business, but the amount of teachers that told me I was gonna end up being a garbage man was like staggering. It was like an everyday barrage. But for me, this is why I love entrepreneurship. There were, you know, sports started telling me I wasn't good enough, right? And that was a very early first, second grade dream. My teachers were definitely telling me that I wasn't good enough. That started bleeding into my friends' parents having comments and snarky comments. But the two places that always told me I was good enough was home. And business, right? You know, like, when I started selling baseball cards in sixth grade, I was the best at it. You know, I was the best at business. So the reason I love the market and the world is the world's always been good to me. It's always told me that I was good, right? And so, I think a lot about positive affirmation. I think a lot about the parents in this room that have kids, and I think a lot about what do they tell their kids? Meaning, what are they cheering for, right? For me, that's a very interesting game. I struggle with cheering for things that are very transactional. You know, I fear that. I fear that it makes our kids robotic. And it makes them every 90 days. And it makes them robots. And I think we struggle as a society to understand creativity, to understand different. And I got very fortunate, I think. And I'll tell you another thing. What I really think my mom drilled, which is a super challenge, because I'll be honest with you, I'm not great at it as a parent, was she made me not think my grades were a reflection of who I was gonna become. But she held me accountable for having bad grades. To find the balance of making me believe that these bad grades would not define me, but also grounding me every three months when my report card came home, is a very fine tightrope that I think every parent here can understand is almost impossible. Like, I really struggle to see it. Cause I think we go too far in any direction. And so, you know, to answer you directly, little Gary by fourth grade understood he was gonna win the world. Nobody was gonna stop him. And he lived in his own cocoon. I lived in my own head. And so your parents were entrepreneur or other small business owners. At what age would you say you really understood the word entrepreneurship? I mean, entrepreneurship wasn't a word. Like, when did I realize entrepreneurship? I don't know, 2006? Like, the word was businessman. There was no entrepreneurship. As a matter of fact, and this will land with people over 40. The only times I heard the word entrepreneur by the time I was 35 was I'd heard it randomly and it usually meant the person was a loser. Right? It meant that they were like making pretend to be a businessman. Like, I remember business man was here and entrepreneur was here and usually thought it was like someone using mommy and daddy's money to make, it's actually now become that again. But when I was growing up, I mean, you rarely say, I mean, I actually think entrepreneur magazine might've been the first time I even like going on a wine trip. I grew up in my dad's business and the wine business. I actually remember maybe going to Napa in my early 20s and seeing entrepreneur magazine on the shelf and I was like, it was just, I just thought I was a businessman. And so, and you have to understand again, there's no entrepreneur when all the kids we just talked to, when I was their age, there was no businessman that you put on a pedestal. It's now popular culture. It's now cool. There was nothing cool about business men. When I, like the most like entrepreneurial or most successful businessman when I was like in high school was the fucking biggest nerd on earth. There was nothing you were aspiring to. It was like, you thought, you know, like it was just not this way today. It's, you know, and I think about this a lot. I think people don't, you know, the one class I was solid at and not got F's in was history. And I think about, I use history a lot as a frame of reference for the future. So, you know, 70 years ago, 60 years ago, a pilot and an astronaut was super famous in America. Like astronauts off the charts and pilots were like, whoa, like athletes. In the 1950s, professional athletes took summer jobs or off season jobs, because they didn't get paid enough. Literally Yankees that won World Series would then go work in hardware stores in Hoboken because they were getting paid so little or less in comparison and now they get paid, you know, $70 million a year. And so I think, you know, I think things change. And I think the entrepreneur really hit fever pitch three, four, five years ago. And I think about that a lot because I'm worried about that, to be honest. How so? Well, I think if you try, if you think entrepreneurship is cruel like being a rapper or a rock star or like the cool stuff, well then you try to become one, which is amazing. The problem is entrepreneurship is not like school. Entrepreneurship is not like your parents. Entrepreneurship doesn't care about your feelings. Entrepreneurship is not fake. Entrepreneurship is not something you can easily like figure out and the results you can't hide. When you get a bad grade, you can like blame the teacher. Right, you can do stuff. When you work in government, like it's a machine in corporate America, machine, you can hide. There's a reason saying like success has a million fathers, failure has none, exist. There are many, many, many, many fake environments in the world, but sports, you can't fake. Last night the Jets played, they lost. They almost won. They almost won. They did all right. They did all right. Another game that happened to happen yesterday was the dolphins got their face beaten. Sports, you know, can't, the dolphins can't wake up today and be like, oh, we did it, but you can do that in corporate. You can do that. It's fake in a lot of places on earth. Sports is not fake. The closest thing to sports is entrepreneurship. Your business either works or it doesn't. You either make money or you don't. It either stays alive or it goes out of business. And what I worry about is a lot of people who are not actual entrepreneurs who are, you know, playing entrepreneur or not pure bread, I want everyone to be an entrepreneur if they are one, but for a lot of people they're a number two. They're a number four. They're a number eight and that's amazing. You know, some people are a stay home dad. Some people are a lawyer. Like there's, we need everything and that's amazing. I don't want people to be entrepreneurs. I want people to be self aware to figure out what makes them happy and live that life. When we made entrepreneurship so cool, a lot of people went for it. The problem is a lot of people have struggled with failing in front of everyone. You know, when you're not built for it and then all of a sudden you go for it and then it fails, that's failure in front of everyone. And the one reason that most people don't do entrepreneurship is they do fear failure. And I think a lot about fear and failure. I think one of the great things that happened to me was I did love sports, which meant I lost a lot. And then with school, I was losing so much in fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh grade that by the time I was 14, I was used to losing. I would argue I loved losing. I think it's why I love being a Jets fan. I'm being serious. I'm being serious. As pissed as I was last night, there was a secret percentage of me that was like, good, good. You know, like, like, you know, and I think, I think that is a characteristic of an entrepreneur and that was a huge characteristic of mine. I think a lot about the kids that I see now that run away from playing something because they're scared to lose. For me, I was the reverse. I would play and play and play. I would cry. I cried a lot. When I was a kid, if you want to know about me, I cried a lot at nine, 10, 11, 12, but I would just get up again and play and get up again and play. And I think we've done a terrible job in our society on demonizing losing. When we give kids eighth place trophies, we confuse them. You understand? We start to tell them as parents, losing is bad. So we have, because they know, I promise all the parents in here, when your kids eat and they get an eighth place trophy, they know it's weird. And when we give them that trophy, we're telling them losing is so bad, we need to like coddle your feelings and we're gonna give you this bullshit trophy. And what ends up happening is it doesn't set them up for real life because real life happens and it doesn't work that way. Before we go to the, I wanna ask you one question about family. What's your biggest professional fail? I could take the next, I passed on, you heard that I invested in Uber in the second round. I passed on Uber twice. And I wrote, my first book I wrote was called Crush It. I acknowledged only my family and one random person, the founder of Uber, Travis, because he helped when I wrote the book, he was the person I sent it to and he gave me great feedback and I wanted to acknowledge him. We were real friends, friends. And I keep a very small circle. I have a lot of acquaintances, but friends, small. He pitched it to me twice. The first time I passed, the second time he picked, I mean, it was in this grove in San Francisco. I think I stopped going to San Francisco because I didn't wanna drive by it. He pitched me emphatically like, hey, I really want you in. And it's funny, it goes back to offense versus defense. I just bought my first meaningful apartment in Manhattan and I was a little less cash-rich than I was accustomed to. And I just didn't feel like I wanted to write that $25,000 or $50,000 check, which I could have. That $25,000 to $50,000 check, I left $400 million on the table. All right, but that is a fail. However, it's not a fail, fail, fail. Well, I don't know how to fail, fail, fail because my parents taught me how to save money. I don't bet the farm to go to zero. My failures are things I've left on the table. My failures are the things I didn't do. When Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, bought a piece of VaynerMedia, he offered us, me and my brother, instead of cash, he offered a piece of the Miami Dolphins. I, out of pure emotion, because it was a good business deal, because I hate the Dolphins with my entire heart, passed on that, instead of the $25 million in cash that we got to put into a fund and maybe 10 more million in cash from me and AJ to split to take home, that 35 is probably $350 million. So I don't know, I've told you two stories that I've already left $700 million on the table. I mean, I can go on. I mean, this is the life of an entrepreneur. Like, honestly, I know what those numbers, I mean, honestly, I'm saying it out loud, I'm like, what the fuck? But like, you know, like, I understand what it sounds like, but the reality is, is like, I'm not doing it for the money. I think that's the biggest reason we have so many fake entrepreneurs. I think the majority of them are doing it for the money. I think most people go into entrepreneurship or business to buy things that the business allowed them to buy. I just wanna build businesses, I just wanna play my game. And so I've made a ton of mistakes. But the one that I most regret is the one I've been most working on. I really struggled with candor in my professional career which is wild because as a public figure and as a personality, when I'm talking to the world, candor is my strength. But when I spoke to people individually that worked for me or that I cared about, I struggled with it. Because if I like you, telling you the truth that you're not doing well at something was a real struggle for me. And by the way, authentically, still is. But I've worked on the last four or five years and I think it's really impacted my business in a very positive way. The thing I most regret are the people that I fired along the way who really weren't good at their jobs. But I never set them up to fix it because I couldn't tell them the truth and then I would surprise them and just fire them. And it's a huge regret and by far the biggest mistake of my career and I'm proud that I'm working on it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we're gonna pivot a little bit and talk about parenting. And I've seen a lot of your content on Instagram and I've never heard, we have some questions that probably never heard. So having, you spoke about micro-adversities. Not some of those micro-adversities that you've really contributed to. So it's not success now. I'm talking a little bit about some of the struggles that you've had and all that built your emotional hoard to handle the bill. There are a lot of movement here in this room and there are a lot of people who came to this country who made it big and Malcolm Bible talks about this too. They're not able to recreate those same conditions. Like you're not gonna have your daughter and a student of eight people having to read this. You can't fake environment. So I think a big question that a lot of people are interested in is how do you build that same strength? You don't. You don't. What hope is there? None. No. No. Look, it's hard to be hungry when you're fed. You know, and so in a room of a lot of immigrants who made it, like, is anyone confused? Like, you're living it. You know. There's a reason it works the way it does. And I also challenge all of us parents who've lived that journey that we shouldn't idolize how we did it and that shouldn't be imposed on our children. We should maybe idolize things that we like about our kindness, who we are as human beings, but we're not gonna be able to replicate the environment. I mean, I sit on the board of pencils of promise and charity water. We do a ton of work in Africa to build schools where there are no schools to get clean water. There's seven, by the way, you wanna be grateful real fast? There are 750 million people on earth, almost 10% that do not have access to clean water. We worry about dumb, silly things. Like, our internet's slow, right? Or like, silly things. And there's 10% of our society doesn't have access to clean water. Think about that. So I sit on these boards. I have all my wealthy friends, many who came up the way I did with less than more. And they're like, can you take my 15 year old son to Africa for a week? I wanna really show them. I'm like, okay. But like, just to save you some time, they're not gonna come back and be totally different people. Like, you know, we try to do all these silly tactics. We're not gonna win that game. I think what we can do, I think we need to focus on civility and humanity and good traits. One thing we do very poorly is we create ideology that can't be accomplished. It is the human spirit. We need to get off the religious bandwagon of that. You can recreate it. You can't, right? You can control it. You can mitigate it. Money is a big one. I talked to my parents about my situation and I'm always like, well, there's gonna be an age where I stop giving it to them. And like, I look at their eyes and I walk away and I know they're laughing at me because they think it's already too late at 14. And I think, oh no, that's the right time. And you know, you go by stories. I have unlimited friends who came up in very wealthy environments whose parents made them get jobs and stopped giving them money around 14, 15, 16. And when I analyzed them versus friends who didn't, in over 40, 50 people, it feels a little bit better. But we're not gonna be able to, like, yeah, you know, my kids are not gonna work in my dad's liquor store for 15 hours a day, 15 years old on, seven days a week for 20 years. That's not happening. And that's okay. It allows me to make fun of them that they're soft. So I think you highlighted in some of this, talk to us a little bit about this hustle mindset, like this working part grinding through the knife, but yet maintaining integrity and really emphasizing character. Well, that's where we screw up words. And like, it's funny even that you asked that. I'll explain what I mean by that. The reason you asked that is we manipulate words. You know, when I was growing up, hustle meant hard work because Pete Rose was Charlie Hussle and he worked hard and like, that was a good word. Then to your point, somewhere in the last five to 10 years, the word hustle kind of got conformed into, and I know that the word hustle is like, I hustled him so there was a negative connotation. But to me, when you just ask that question, I laugh, like, why would work ethic compromise honor? Those are the two easiest things to balance on earth. So I think that just comes down to how we interpret words. I used hustle as a public figure from 2006 to 2014, aggressively, it communicated what I believed, which is there's a lot of things all of us cannot control. But one thing we can all control is how much effort we put into things. It's the most controllable thing. But then the word got manipulated. And started to mean burnout or when at all costs or money over everything. And so I walked away from that word. I mean, my usage of that word is so low now. I just use work ethic. It allows me to explain the same thing. I'm not emotionally attached to any words, but being able to balance work ethic with doing the right thing is the only thing I believe in. Very nice. So that's the last thing. I'll give you one to build on if I may. I think one thing, I'm sorry to jump in, but that really inspired me. There's another thing I think a lot about. So how many people here by show of hands consume some of my content or have a good gist of my content? Raise your hands. Thank you. So for the people that raised your hands, for the other people that didn't, one of my favorite things to talk about is patience. I'm obsessed with it. I believe in it the most. I think it leads to very good behavior. I think impatience is often an indication of insecurity, rushing for success to show others, not themselves. And so for me, I push patience a lot. I'm stunned by how many people struggle with me pushing patience, because they hear complacency. Because, you know, and I'm fascinated by people's inability to balance words that may seem in contradiction. To me, I'm as ambitious as they come. I'm hungry, I'm sitting here today, and there's not a person in the audience that scares me that they're hungrier, because I don't feel fulfilled. I'm still super driven. I feel like I haven't even started. And so I sit here hungry, but I equally impatient. You know, when I hear about my wife's little gold to buy the New York Jets, right? Like a lot of people, now that I'm a public figure, like when are you gonna do it next year? I see all these people out in the open that happened today at the airport in Newark. Guys like, when are you gonna buy the Jets? And I'm like, 32 years? And like the disappointment in his face. And so I think people struggle to balance what may seem like contradictions. And I think in that, there's something important to dig into. That I think you've reframed before. I have actually heard, isolation helps your brain blood. So a lot of such people are gonna put up a Q&A. AI, she doesn't have AI. That's been a huge topic of conversation across industries, such good education. I'd love to hear a little bit about how does that influence contact creation and how are you grappling with kind of the way the market is involved as a result? I mean, do you know the history of how we talked about electricity as a society when it first hit? So I don't know if you know this. Most people demonized electricity when it was invented. Most conventional conversations were that it was demons in our house. It was so new and so profound that the concept of electricity versus candles was too much. And we decided that it's bad. I couldn't believe more that that's what we're doing with AI right now. That people are focusing on demonizing it because let me make this very clear to this auditorium. AI is bananas big. It is one of the most significant technology advancements in humankind. It will change absolutely everything. It is a big deal. It's the invention of the internet big. It is going to absolutely change industries, companies fortune. It will reset the deck. And whomever governments, whomever private companies, whomever entrepreneurs and personality harnesses AI for their advantage will win. And so right now, for example, and you know, as a bad student, I have some of my own personal pent up feelings to the education system, education, I believe in more than anything in the world. It's how the world advances. How it's packaged and sold is always a feeling I have in my tummy. When the AI thing started happening 18 months ago, 12 months ago, of course school started to ban it. And I was laughing as if these kids are not gonna live in a world of AI. As if we, even just the whole concept, making kids memorize stuff when all the information's on the phone, not allowing them to use AI. Because what, we have a religious belief that they should write the paper. I think it's epic that they write the paper in one second, let them go do whatever else they want to do. Woo! The kids like that one. The kids like that one. Look, look, I think that we tend to demonize the most important things. And we've done this before. We don't understand it's how people use it. And it's on us, not the thing. We've tried banning things in society. Remember the prohibition? That didn't work out. Humans are gonna be humans. They're gonna do their thing. I've got a news alert. AI is not going back into the genie bottle. We're not going backwards. And there's a lot of people in this room who have a negative point of view on AI who also said they were never gonna get an iPhone because their BlackBerry had buttons on it. A lot of them here. And I also remember them saying they're never gonna get a BlackBerry because their pager was good enough and they didn't wanna have a phone so that people could bother them any time. If they wanted them, they could page them and you would call them when you were ready. Ban, people demonized the internet. People demonized email. People demonized people really, because I was at the forefront of it. People super demonized social media. Everybody told me they'd never be on Facebook because that was for kids. And so we're very good at saying no. And I think I've built my entire happiness and professional success on maybe. And so I highly recommend if you remember anything I said tonight. Way too many parents when they parent kids. Way too many professionals when they think about their futures or make decisions of new technologies. You default into no. Which means actually you've lost on impact. If you were a no person, it's already over. You lost. No is not protecting you the way you think. No is the only losing formula. Maybe with an open mind to decide yes or no is what a lot of you are doing with no. Maybe is what you're searching for. Maybe is what leads to happiness. A better relationship with your child. A better opportunity in business. It's maybe that we need to fall in love with. This no culture we live in is a huge, huge limiter of joy and profits. Thank you. All right. Thank you.
