What I know is that you're sitting on some really fun information. Can you share anything about like what's been selling during this? Yes. And I'm going to do a plug. You got your perspective. I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? So we've got our last guest for today, Dina Bari. Dina serves as StockX CMO, a Detroit based online resale marketplace. Dina has demonstrated a history of building beloved consumer brands having served as a CMO for three other companies, including Birchbox. We're super excited to have you, Dina. Dina, how are you? Hello. Great to see you all. It's just last together on our happy hour. Yes, that's right. Well, let's get right into the thing I'm actually curious about. You've got a really epic background. What's on those shelves? Anything interesting? Oh my gosh. Anything I can flip on eBay? You do not believe how much commentary these bookshelves get. The big joke is this was actually meant to be my husband. We moved to Detroit when I accepted this job, right? So we're six months, seven months into living in Michigan, moved from California. And we set up this office because my husband runs his own business and works from home. And it took me about four weeks to take over the office and the bookshelf. There's everything in here from philosophy and yoga books to there's a book called Cabin Porn right behind me. And then all kinds of fiction from all stages of our lives. But this is the ultimate conversation piece right here. How do you consider yourself? How do you view yourself as a leader? Since that's kind of the ethos of this. And like all of us, we've all evolved and gotten better. What has been the biggest thing that you've closed the gap on in your career that you're just like happy? You're like, wow, I'm really glad I got better at this because had I not, I don't think I could be the leader I am today. Yeah. Well, there, I think there's two things. And one of them I'm going to echo what Locky said just a little while ago, you know, the idea of being a thinker that can combine left and right parts of the brain. I think in marketing in particular, that is a very valuable skill and hard to find. So I think that is something that I would say describes my style holistic thinker and somebody who likes to synthesize and integrate. And then I think the other thing is just being empathetic, being a very like holistic person in the sense of like, look, we, I know you're back. I think you're back. I'm back. Good. Sorry about that. No worries. Okay. I'll just backtrack a little bit. You know, the idea I was talking about the idea of left and right brain thinking coming together and being an integrative thinker. And then being somebody who really appreciates and values the whole self being brought to work and I show up that way. I want my team to show up that way. And I think as leaders today, especially in this climate, it's so critically important and showing your team that that's what you believe in. That's what you support from them helps to bring out the best. The most creativity, the best results and the most present and committed work. What, um, what has really been the biggest observation you've had about being a leader during COVID because obviously some of us are fortunate. It's funny how I just said that it was like a little bit of a slip. I was going to say, fortunate enough to navigate through the great recession or 9 11 or things that nature, those are not fortunate things, but like, I definitely felt that we were in a 10 year window where a lot of people were already at 32 years old in their career and they've never been through anything but hyper growth and I was like, man, one day this is going to hit. And so here we are. Thoughts on that. Yeah, totally. I'm a huge believer in the fact that the failures or the missteps or even the things that are outside of your control like macro events. The challenges make you better and you know, having lived through the great recession 9 11, even having joined a startup that was a total bust, you know, and literally went out of business. Those things, I think make us more resilient, more adaptable, more creative and I think those are like critical skills in COVID-19, you know, marketing and business. So, you know, when I think about showing up for my team at StockX, the leadership team spends a lot of time making sure that we are keeping people together, keeping them connected. And so I think that a lot of people are lonely, isolated, confused, you know, all the all the negative feelings and, you know, work can play a role in combating that and leadership and teams can play a role in combating that so that's, I think one really important thread for our company and for me personally is just being there for my team. And so, certainly, is encouraging the adaptability of the growth mindset. Again, it's a basic survival skill, right, you got to be able to land on your feet when unforeseen circumstances present themselves. And in marketing, in particular, there are some very new real constraints if you think about experiential marketing content, these are, these are areas that really have relied on the in real life experiences to create what they create and suddenly those avenues are cut off. And so it's only the people who are open minded, flexible, willing to adapt that can not only survive, but I think actually come up with better ideas. We've, our team has come up with new ways of working in this environment that I think we're going to bring with us into the future into the normal when we return to normal. You know, thinking more creatively about how to generate content in a scalable way that reaches more people taking events that might have been activated in real life and bringing them to a digital forum so that more people can participate like these are really valuable skills. So, I think teams that are focused on being adaptable can actually grow through this. So, I've had the great fortune of knowing Josh very early on literally one of the great misses of my entrepreneurial investing career is not investing in StockX early on around things that I love like flipping and sneakers and now sports cards which you know has super got me fired up. Yeah. So, you know, you're sitting on some really fun information. Can you share anything about like what's been selling during this? Yes. And I'm going to do. I'm going to do a plug. Okay, we just published a media report, which has is like a gold mine of fun facts but it's called the StockX snapshot. It's our market movers and we talk about things that I need that immediately Andrea please. That should be in my inbox right now like Amy get on this I need that now. Go ahead. You know, some fun facts and I'm going to cheat and refer to it but you know puzzles up almost 600% slides because who's going you know who's going outside anymore right so up almost 400% masks, obviously up 300% You know, slippers again a big mover track pants like all the stuff that we are wearing every day right and then I think the other thing that we've seen is a resurgence of what you might call classic silhouettes and sneaker like I think this is a time when people are maybe hesitant to splurge on that really luxury item that may or may not have enduring value but You know the classic silhouettes that have been relevant for 20 years that people are Plus, you know for the people that don't collect and flip who actually wear these incredible you know just the dominance you have with sneakers. Look, let's call a spade a spade for a lot of human beings flexing with that impossible to get pair of off whites when you go court side to an NBA game is very much in the culture of this and if you're not doing that maybe you don't need to do that right this minute. 100% and I think the other thing is you know the last dance like that has been an amazing influence in our world and and it's this beautiful converging right because I think a lot of people you know we have such a diverse group you know obviously you and I can talk about this all day, explain even the last dance what that is. So the last dance is this amazing documentary about Michael Jordan in the bulls and their attempt to win their final championship NBA championship and it really talks about, you know, the team it talks about Michael Jordan and it talks about his brand as well and and in sneakers you know his brand is a force like potentially the biggest force to be reckoned with. And what we've seen, you know, actually HBO release this pulled the release date up. It was meant to be released later on and then when COVID came along and sports were canceled I think they saw a big window. Again sign of adaptability so they released this early, and it was at a time and there was nothing, nothing to watch on TV for a sports fan and so it was just brilliant timing and it was actually brilliant marketing for stock X we were not involved. I keep saying that would have been a dream, a dream relationship dream partnership, but it still had this incredible effect of reintroducing people to Jordan brand shoes and we've had some of our best ever days. Actually during this period which is sort of hard to believe you never would have predicted that right in April and we're all sitting at home and saying what does this mean for business. We've had records around certain silhouettes that were released in the past couple of months that have become our best ever sellers fastest ever sellers. So, I think it shows, you know, back to the trends question like the power of enduring classics and in a time like this when there's uncertainty and stress and, you know, recessionary forces like people are spending money on the things that have proven proven value. Okay, it's a nice job with content series, give everybody a little context to that content. Yeah. Absolutely. Well thanks for that plug. You're even amazing team and basically, you know, their remit is to tell stories that are relevant to our, you know, the products that we sell so it's always contextualize in our world of sneakers, sort of culturally relevant products, and the people the creators who use those products to express themselves. And so we have this whole network of influencers musicians athletes, all kinds of creators that we collaborate with to tell stories and and often the product plays a role in that. Sometimes it doesn't but we do make an effort to bring it back so that it's related to what we're selling on the platform. And, you know, we use a mix of long form we have these amazing, you know, almost historical pieces we actually have someone on our content team who's a PhD, we have two PhDs and one of them is a rap and hip hop historian. We have these amazing long form pieces about, you know, the history of sneakers through hip hop culture, or we have other pieces that are more SEO oriented meant to drive results, you know, all the shoes in the last dance top 10 Jordan shoes. And then we also have other firms, you know, video. And we've been coming up with these more sound bite written forms lately to just hear what it's like to be a person a creator and Barcelona a creator and Toronto, you know, as we grow more globally and the community become in many ways cove it has, you know, shrunk our world because we're all alone more and at home more but it's also expanded our world because we're online and we're, you know, the boundaries that previously existed for physical interactions have been raised so you know we're trying to lean into that and introduce more of the cultural marketplace at the global marketplace that is stock X to our community. And so we've come up with a few new conceits during this time one of them is online with which is that short format interview with creators around the world. And we're going to keep testing and experimenting I think that's one thing that is very much part of our DNA as a startup. And as a brand that's on the forefront of culture. Do you believe that every brand should start thinking of themselves more in the production of content as a marketing execution, not just a maker of commercials and ads. Yes, I think especially in so the world that I live in is direct to consumer. You know I spent 15 years and in direct to consumer startups and I think when you're building that direct relationship with a consumer you have to engage them in a deeper way than just the transactional way and content plays a huge role to show that you have a voice you have a point of view you have authority in the space that you care about the issues the customer cares about I think this is part of being a customer centered brand and business you talked about that on your last call. You know I think brands that own their channels and aren't relying on supply other sort of distribution have that advantage where they can go really deep with a customer. And that means you have the data but it also means you have the relationship you have the connective tissue with, you know, all the stories that you tell. When did you get to Detroit. I was here so I started the job in September and I was commuting believe this or not I was commuting from California so I was flying here on Monday going home on Thursday, and then my family, and I relocated in November. So right in the, in the winter. So what was what was your favorite. Let's give Detroit a little love and I know it was only only like eight to 10 weeks before 1214 weeks before coven hit but what was your first observation. I really enjoyed the resurrection of such a great city in a lot of ways. Your, your biggest observation for D town. Yeah, I mean, there, there is so much heart for Detroit and one of the things that I think is really remarkable is just like when you come to Detroit, the people who are here are just so loving and they're like, yes, we welcome you a new person into our community and we want you to survive and thrive here because that's how we're going to thrive. So that's one thing I mean the people very welcome right. There's loving you know and they want people to to participate in the community which is awesome. You know I spent a lot of time in my first six weeks of the job staying in hotels right and downtown Detroit and eating in restaurants so because I didn't have a kitchen to cook in so I will do a shout out for what has become my favorite restaurant downtown, which is Leila. It's a Lebanese restaurant and I'm Lebanese so it has special meaning to me, but it's like amazing food. So wait real quick real quick just for some fun so you see a Lebanese restaurant in, you know, you know, I come from, you know, Soviet Russian to say like we're, there's always that thing is this going to be as good as my grandma's thing or my family say like, are you are you like a tough critic of Lebanese food and it like surprise you. So did it surprise you did like like how did how did that whole little yes I am a tough critic, and it did surprise me. Pleasantly, the dish that I always used to judge is a simple one it's Baba Ghanouj but it's like, you know, it's sometimes those most simple things where you can tell what's going on. And, but then it also has like a modern flair so amazing cocktails amazing vibe great service you know so you feel like you're in a really cosmopolitan city and like a world class restaurant. And we lived in New York and San Francisco so we love that. You're spoiled with food. We're spoiled but I will say the food here in Detroit has been really fantastic so I'm pleasantly surprised and eager to get back out there and start eating my face off again.
