## Transcript
Hey guys, we're starting a new series called Analyzing the Original. This is where I look at content that I put out in the world and I try to add more context. This could be a really fruitful series. So we're gonna try it out, we're trying to innovate. You've seen Over Under. We're gonna try to do this and let's get into the first episode. You could've ended up being a boss, a treat. I just don't get the mentality of being head down sad on a Monday morning. Ah, the classic. So what went through your head on February 22nd, 2015 that you thought you had to make this video? Were we doing DailyVee? No, this wasn't even morning. Why were you there? Did I text you in the morning and say? On Saturday night before you got hate. I now remember, I was reading, I mean almost everything that I come up with comes from reading and listening. I always talk about, you hear me talking, you hear me interrupting people on shit. The reason I interrupt, I think, in podcasts I've already heard what the person's gonna say and I do a bad job really thinking about the audience because I'm in the moment and I'm not a great interviewer for that reason. But I am listening and I was reading comments, D-Rock, and was like, man, people fucking hate Monday. And I was like, we need to change the perspective on this. People are really depressed, anxious, upset, angry, and they're alive and they can do something about it. So first let's put things into perspective and I really just, right, I texted you and it was like, come over Monday morning, we're gonna film this shit. I'm glad that it was a gloomy day. I'm glad it turned out to be like this. This is a real classic. What made this video so successful, D-Think? A couple things happened. I think it caught a lot of people's truth, which is in general what I think my content does. I think the setting was very raw and real. I mean, this is now, D-Rock, we're getting old. This is six years ago. This did really well on Instagram. On Facebook. On Facebook. On Facebook. It was just raw, it was super real. I really meant it. I feel like I'm always at my best when I mean it. Do you remember how you ended the video? No. Do you remember how you started the video? I can almost feel the start, but I don't necessarily remember. Cool, what's the point? Wait, wait, I hope that I haven't had a re-created before you listen to it. You could've been hit by a fucking bus. I remember the bus coming by. You could've been born a tree or you could've been born a bus. You could've ended up being a bus, a tree. All right, ready? So it's early Monday morning and I've been wanting to make a Monday morning video for a long time and finally DRock were doing it. So real quick. Stop right there. A couple weeks ago I wrote a blog post about smoke than fire. I'm always smoking, I'm always smoking. So clearly what happened in that weekend was I read enough DMs or emails that finally got me over the top that my smoke became fire, which was me saying that to the audience is like, this has been on my mind and it has. People hating Monday is something I've really been in tune with because I hated Monday from 1982 to 1998 because I hated school. Good phone. This is just a rant, very simple and something that I want you to pass on or watch every Monday morning because the level of complaining is unacceptable. Look, what if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you you died this week? Would you complain about your crap job? Think about that. Today I was with a guy for 15 minutes who's working with the Sasha group and he talked about always hearing me about this, always resonated and then his son had a brain tumor and he was going so hard, all these businesses and he was like, who gives a shit? I was like, yeah. And people need to know that. People are complaining right now about pay, about burnout, about COVID, not going skiing and like, cool, I get it. There's nothing wrong with being disappointed but fucking being dwelling and devastated and like, life is ruined when there's so much pain in the world around people who've really lost loved ones or died or really, really affected by this disease. You gotta put things in perspective. And I really do believe that people would not hate their Monday and complain about their job if they knew that it was their last Monday. They just wouldn't think about the world that way and think living that way while being patient. It's that friction of the opposite opinions. Like, live like it's your last day on earth but like, anticipate living for 50 years. It's a tough juxtaposition for people to handle opposite thinking and I think that's what really works for me. Or that test you don't wanna take, I doubt it. You would go much higher level thinking. Well, that's really what it takes. It takes understanding that if you're not pumped right now, if you're begrudging what you're about to do, if you're not looking forward to it, look, I respect practicality. You gotta go through school because your parents want you to pay your rent. You got scooted in loans, I get it. But please recognize. By the way, that's just a moment of less if we're doing the analyst. Like, who gives a fuck that I didn't say a word? You got the point. People like stop because they're like, oh, I lisped a little bit on that word. I don't give a fuck, just penetrate through. Like, people will connect with your authenticity not if you pronounced a word properly. Anybody that gets caught up on fucking pronunciation grammar is playing the fucking small game anyway. Why do people get caught up? Because they're fucking micro, fear-based. They need to control little things to make them feel comfortable. Because they're nitpicking, because they're trying to tear down the person that's making the content because they wish they were. Because they grew up in a proper framework where it was unacceptable, but there's so much deep unhappiness playing in that framework. There's nobody aesthetic and glowing that they lived life properly around pronunciation or grammar. I promise. This internet thing created way more opportunity for all of us, way more. I mean, look. When you know the world's abundant, you can get happy. You could have had sex like three minutes later and you weren't even exist. That's true. And you're complaining. You could have ended up being a bus. Who wants to be a bus? I just don't get the mentality of being head down sad on a Monday morning. It's not practical. I'm gonna be Monday morning, my bitch. I'm gonna be this Saturday Monday morning. That's what I want to do every morning. And that's what I want from you. Please take a step back and think about how awesome it actually is. 100%. And then recognize that you can attack the world in a totally different way. Because you were lucky enough to be born during this. Life is how you see it. Fuck it, Monday. Yeah, honestly, Monday the brand pisses me off the way other things. Branding of things that are, you know, Friday, thank God it's Friday, hump day. It's like a whole systematic machine to accept being unhappy in your job. Like, it's just, it's not a good idea. And I think life is how you see it. And if you think it's supposed to be a life of like not liking your job, you just gotta get through it, put it on your hat. Like things that you have to do, keeping it real. Keeping it real negative. A lot of people keep it real negative. I wanna keep it real, real, real positive. There's always opportunity. If you take on accountability, patience, practicality, focus, like you can make it better. Because millions and tens of millions and hundreds of millions of people have made their lives better over the last 30 years. So why can't you? That's real talk. I'm really glad I said that. Cause that's fucking truth. If tens of millions of people over the last 25 years have figured out a way to make their life better, why can't you? Look, I'm a feedback machine as you heard.
