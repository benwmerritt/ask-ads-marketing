If you're just doing it for the Lambo or the money, you're gonna get caught because you're not gonna like it enough to self sustain. You're still putting in the work to try to be good at a tournament because you fucking like it. You just asked me why am I still working because I like it and I'm good at it. You like it and good at it. You like it and good at it are the only two sustainable things. You've got to have one of them, but the fucking Nirvana, the fucking Apex, the fucking tippy top is when you got both. Attention is the number one asset. Oh my God, it's been so long, bro. Dude, it's so good to see you, bro. I really want you to tell the thousands of people that are watching me across all the other platforms who don't know who you are yet because you're going to grow into all of them. Just tell them two seconds about you. Actually, a lot of them know because that podcast we did, people bring it up to me all the time. How that podcast with you made them feel comfortable in letting their kids play Fortnite all the time. Oh, well, okay. I also want to give unlimited love to your whole community that's watching right now. We have 120,000 people watching right now. We got a lot of people watching right now. W's in the chat for me watching. For Gary, I'm Clix, also known as Clix. I'm a Fortnite player and I stream on the side and I make content and stuff like that. Bro, you are literally living the dream of so many teenagers. How are you not letting the fame and the money fuck you up? Let's start with that. That's the first real question. Man, I thought I was going to interview you and you, Gary. I'm going to be honest. You're allowed to, but I just really think you can help a lot of kids. By the way, you probably don't have it fully figured out because you're a normal young person with that level of fame and money. It's always going to fuck up shit and you're probably chasing the hookups. I know you're a dude. You're a fucking living life, but there's at some level, I'm just really proud of you. Thank you, bro. I appreciate that. I know you enough to know and I'm just proud of you and I'm really asking you, like, how the fuck are you? What do you think you're doing well or what is working for you that's allowing you not to completely go off the reservation and be a complete fuck up? Oh, man. Well, I definitely think it's the way I was raised. You know what I'm saying? Like the way I was raised with my family and all that, they definitely raised me to not blurs my money, number one. My whole entire family is fully Italian. They're always like safe, safe, safe, put in the bag, invest and all that. So it's like making money. Like I don't really, I don't really be spending too much money other than like, you know, gifted myself some stuff every year. Other than that, it's like, focus on the career. Don't let anything get to you. It's all like my main thing that I really focus on is if it's not going to be a big deal in like a year, watch this over in general. So that's the one thing that I'm like trying to try to work on, not really care about like the little stuff that's making me mad. And other than that, that's about it, Gary. I'm going to be honest. How are you feeling about the competitive side of your career? Like you're a competitive gamer. You're like, you know, you're so unique because you're actually great at the game, but you're also such an entertaining streamer, right? Like, you know, the cliche thing in gaming is like, they could be a personality, but they don't have the skill set in the game. You really are unique. Almost like an Andre Agassi in tennis, like the way when he came up in the 80s, 90s, whatever it was, like he was cool as fuck, but he also could play, which was on, you know, do you recognize that in you? Are you proud of that? Is that something you try to work on? Do you get scared as you get more fame and opportunity and money that you might lose your skill set as being a top player? You also know that 14 year olds and 13 year olds are coming up. These like, it's crazy that someone at your age knows that there's youngsters coming up that like have 100% of their time working on their craft. Like you did when you were fucking 13, four, like what's your mindset on that? I mean, I always thought like the older I'm going to get the worse I'm going to get, but now 19 years old, I feel like I feel like I'm honestly still in my prime. Like last, last championship was like one of my best placements in the best I ever played. I'm so proud of you, bro. That was huge. What place did I get Gary? Fourth or fifth or third? Wait, I thought he was lying. I thought you were lying. What the fuck do you think you're fucking talking to, bro? Damn. Bro, I'd be the fuck attention and I know some bullshitting happened there where like you missed the spot, bro. I fucking pay attention. Damn. Tell me Gary. I didn't know that. I fucking got here by accident. I fucking pay attention more than every fuck around earth. Yeah. You got to fucking know Gary. Damn. Yeah. But no, we got, we got forts out of like millions of people, but that was like a super good placement. That was like the grand finals. I think we cashed out like 50, 60 grand, but it's more about just doing good and keeping that up. So now in my career, it takes a lot more effort to do good since I was 13. Like it was 13. It was like to be honest, it was just me messing around, having fun and like I was winning and all that. But now it's like, I actually need to put in the work and I need to actually grind now that I'm older. That's the part I'm proud of you. Like, right? Like the whole like, was this right? Like I think I was talking to one of your teammates or my team, like you like went to Germany for better Wi-Fi to prep for the tournament. Like you're putting in the work. Yeah. No, I did go to Germany. So what was that? I went to Germany for Hugo Boss. But then I streamed like 24 hours for and I, I knew Hugo Boss or in Germany, which is cool. I just appreciate that you're working on your correct, like dude, again, I'm going to say it again. I know exactly the life you're living right now. A lot of viewers here know and a lot of viewers don't know. You have so much opportunity to not be putting in the work and doing it right. And you're putting in, you're putting in the work, you're doing it right. And I'm proud of you. Thank you, bro. That's a good question. I'm going to ask you. Okay. Like you're worth over like $300 million, billions of dollars in companies and all that. Why do you, why do you care? Like why are you still streaming? You are streaming your whole entire day. 11 hours a day. Once you already accomplished like all what you want to accomplish in life. Because I haven't accomplished what I wanted in life. My, what I want out of life is enjoying the process. Right. I've never been about the trophies. I just like the process. I like the practice as much as I like the games. And I definitely don't like the trophies. I don't live for the trophies. I don't live for the cheering of the crowd. I live for fucking my process. I love being an entrepreneur. I love being entrepreneur. I love putting out content that might help someone else. And honestly, Gary Vee, me is the person that I wish was around when I was 15. You know, we grew up in a different era than you did. We didn't have the internet, bro. I didn't have the internet. That's crazy. That is really crazy. Forget about Twitch. Forget about social media. We didn't have the internet. I wasn't on the internet until I was 18 about your age. Saying that is so for me, that is crazy. So for me, I would I love putting out content for make pretend 15 year old me that I would have been affected by. And think about what you answered. Why am I good? Because my family gave me good money relationships. Italian family, safe, safe, safe. A lot of people don't grow up in that world. They don't get the luck of that. And so the way you get better in life is you find other people that aren't your family and your upbringing that bring you value. I see where I see where you're saying. So you're saying like we see you as that someone who's going to give us like inspiration to like how to succeed and all that stuff. And not even just you, just someone who doesn't have like a family figure, giving them good advice. Look, at some level, like when you're in a good place, you want to give and like I'm in a good place before I had the money and the recognition. Like all my homies that I grew up with, they'll tell you who I was in high school and college. Like I was always nice because I was already good. I was always happy. I wanted I was always that way. And so I get a lot of joy out of getting an email or DM from a kid of like this one clip meant this to me. It's like, you know, this you're living the same life and you're doing it from an entertainment standpoint or from a graph standpoint, teaching people how to be better or an aspirational standpoint that want to be like you. Like this is why I think I take a lot of pride in and why I pay attention to you is like kids need people to look up to that are doing it a good way. Okay. I'm seeing that. I'm seeing that. Um, so for the kids watching my chat right now, who don't have anything to do, they don't want to go to college. They don't they want to do social media. They want to do consecration. They watch my streams and all that. What is the best advice that you would give them to start or to make their first million to make their first $1,000 and all that? Because I can't I can't even answer that question when they asked me. Like I'm like, maybe like start on TikTok, start doing that. But you're business oriented. You have that whole entire mind. So what would you sell all the people in my chat? So everybody listen, first and foremost, and this is like heavy shit when you're 13, 16, 12. It's first about being self aware. Like if you don't know yourself, you're dead. So like I get that everybody wishes they were as like they want to be a professional gamer, but you happen to be naturally good at it. And then you built your skills on top of it and put in the work. So natural talent matters, right? Natural talent matters and work matters. So what I would say to a lot of people is you've got to really put in the work, but it but deploy it against something you like or you're good at or you're interested in. Like if you're just doing it for the Lambo or the money, you're going to get caught because you're not going to like it enough to self sustain. You're still putting in the work to try to be good at a tournament. We just talked about that because you fucking like it. You just asked me why am I still working because I like it and I'm good at it. You like it and good at it. Like it and good at it are the only two sustainable things. You've got to have one of them. But the fucking Nirvana, the fucking apex, the fucking tippy top is when you got both. And everybody who's listening in your world needs to understand, right? Understand that they have to figure that out for themselves. They can't want to be you or anybody else. They need to be themselves and they got to figure that out. They can be inspired by, but they're going to have to figure out their framework on that. I want to be honest that that that hate that. Hey, Gary, I get that because people look at me and they're like, all right, they want to become like a four night player or stuff like that. But they grind 12 hours a day and they're still ass at the game. So it's like, maybe, maybe it's just not for them. That's exactly what it is. Like I wish that I was a lot of different thing. I wish it could be the quarterback of the jet so I could win a Super Bowl. I want it bad, but that's not in it for me. And some people want to be stand up comics and rappers and comedic influencers, but they're not going to be shingillist or not as talented, right? And that's going to be now they could be better at stand up. Like what people don't understand is the hard work is only a piece of the equation, but that doesn't mean you can't be better at it. For example, right? You know that if they're 12 hours at it, they're asked by your standards because you're fucking one of the best players in the world. But they're way better than they were a year ago. And they might have went from like the 13th or 90th best kid in their school to the second best kid. But that doesn't mean they're going to win fucking tournaments. That's got a ceiling. And by the way, that's OK. They could become a professional streamer. Stick with me on this because this is some shit that your world's not talking about. They can be a streamer that makes fifty five thousand a year and love life. They live within that because there's a lot of people making fifty five thousand a year being an assistant manager at a dollar general that it would have been. But that loves gaming that it would have been better that they made fifty five thousand playing fucking Fortnite or whatever the next game is going to be or Call of Duty or whatever. So there's levels to this game, right? There's levels to this shit, Gary. Levels to this shit. So like, look, not everyone's going to make millions like you at it, but they might make one hundred thirty thousand a year in Twitch revenue. And that might be a remarkable life and real talk. They may end up being happier than someone who makes thirty million a year. Hundred percent. Like so there's different. There's different levels to this shit. Yeah. No, you're right on that. You 100 percent right. A question for me, though. Aside from the streaming and all that, let's just say I have a load of money, right? And I'm already into real estate and I'm already doing stocks and all that. What would you invest millions of dollars in right now? Twenty twenty four. That's you think like obviously nothing's promising, but that you think is going to go up in the next five years. I think I'm understanding your situation. I think a couple of things. One, investing is tricky, but like I'm very, very bullish Internet companies. Like the world is only going more technologies. And I think they have big advantages. So the best tech companies in the world, the apples, the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, they're really nice. I don't think there's no such thing as a safe or guaranteed bet. But if I was really investing and I didn't have a deep passion for something. So let me tell you about me. I'm I'm very high risk when I do that. I like investing in early stage companies. I'm okay with using the money to go to zero because I get enjoyment out of that. I want to be me. But if I was like, but what I if I if you were really asking me and I'm answering you, if it was just me and you and dinner and I'm letting everybody watch, you know, I like Internet companies because they have big advantages because the world's going more technology, not less. Okay. So you're saying startup companies are you saying startup companies are companies that are already big and you see already becoming more big? I feel like you're asking the question from your point of view, like actually you. So I'm giving you an answer of what I probably do to diversify if I was you. I would say like, you know, you're obviously getting your money probably managed at this point, given the size and scale that you're at. But if you're asking me like real, there's things that are tried and true. The best innovative companies as public stocks that are mature companies tend to do well if the world keeps heading into technology place. And I think we're going to have acceleration. I think the big tech companies are going to have big advantages in AI because I think the government's going to want to regulate it. And there's so like, so I'm just trying to think through that stuff. But like the reality is, is investing is always hard. And by the way, for the first time, you have money at a very good time clicks. You can actually make money on your money. T bills, you can get real interest on your money. That didn't exist five years. But Gary, this is the thing, dude. This is like, I'm just going to full be myself. Like, dude, I'm investing all my money. I'm getting I'm getting like a 6% return on my money, right? Which is good, right? Which is really good. My dad and my team always says that's really good. But it is really good. Transparently, I don't see as good. Like I want to be making a lot more. Do you know what I'm saying? Of course I do. So then because you're trying to do what I'm trying to do, you should tell your parents or your dad or and the people that you should, you should literally take a percentage of that, a small percentage. Like you should be allowed to take a million dollars and invest it in very early stage companies and try to get an 8000% return. That's what I'm talking about. That shit, that shit would be the shit that gets me going. Of course. But by the way, to make 8000 or 800 or 500% 5x, 15x, 50x, that means it's very likely. Very likely that it's going to go to zero. Yeah. So then I'm going to lose a mill. Well, that and you know, again, and for everybody, whether it's $5 or a million dollars, if it's a percentage that you're able to lose, that's when you go high risk, high reward. When it's not, then you just take your small. Gary, I'm not on your level yet. You know, if I lose a mill, let me tell you, I need to get out of here. So then maybe you need to decide to only put 100,000 into ridiculous high risk, high risk. I'm messing. I'm messing. You're right. I know exactly. I don't want to blow up your spot. I'm going to humble for you, bro. I know exactly where you're at. Hey, listen, dude, I'm trying to become my you, Gary. I'm going to be honest. You have you have the point where you love life and you have fuck you money, bro. And you have fuck you respect that when you are this is not about the money, but when you walk in that room, bro, the amount of times where I'm with you, I'm going to I'm going to suck you off for a second. A lot of times where you go in a room and every mother's fucker shuts the fuck up. And just looks at you is actually insane. I mean, I would go to events with Gary in the amount of respect that he gets. It's like, you feel like you're you go in that room. I feel your aura. Like I feel the degrees changes in the room. I wish I was joking. I'm being dead ass, Gary. You know, I get like that, dude. And anyway, you're not even tall, though. That's the thing. It's not high. You're not taller, bro. Yeah. Listen, I'm six foot. Are you? Yeah, I'm six foot. Come on, bro. Wait, you want to make a real bet that you have to come and we measure you officially in your 511? Uh, every dude that says they're six foot on the dot is 511 something. Yeah, I might be five. I might be 511. But hey, I'm there. I'm almost there. And so that's what matters. But but that's the question, bro. The question is you keep doing things. One of the things you do well and I see how you move with these kids, you keep giving a fuck about others instead of just yourself and not exactly that same thing's going to happen with you and you're going to go there. Wait, you just had give a fuck about don't give a fuck about myself, but give a fuck about others. That's right. I mean, it's not don't give a fuck about yourself. But the reason you're going to be respected too is when you actually care about other people and you've put W's on the board, then you're that perfect mix of when you walk into a room and good shit happens. They either like you for who you are or what they've heard about how you actually move behind the scenes or they like you for being actually accomplished for doing things. But when you can combine them both, it creates that level of aura. Joe, you just said some though you need to repeat that because I thought it's the opposite. Gary, I thought it's I thought it's what people say about you, bro. Just keep on standing in line to do you. That's no, no. Don't value other people's opinions so that you be because it's triggering insecurity. That's right. But caring actually caring about others is exactly right. Not being affected by judgment by people who don't know you. That's a different play. Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it. Yeah, yeah, I get it now. I get it now. I'm going to bounce. New book is coming.
