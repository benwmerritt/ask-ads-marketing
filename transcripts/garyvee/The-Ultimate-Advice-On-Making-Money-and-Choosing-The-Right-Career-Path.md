For the kids watching my chat right now, who don't have anything to do, they don't wanna go to college, they wanna do social media, they wanna do consecration, they watch my streams and all that, what is the best advice that you would give them to start or to make their first million, to make their first $1,000 and all that? So everybody, listen, first and foremost, and this is like heavy shit when you're 13, 16, 12, it's first about being self-aware. Like if you don't know yourself, you're dead. So like I get that everybody wishes, like they wanna be a professional gamer, but you happen to be naturally good at it. And then you build your skills on top of it and put in the work. So natural talent matters and work matters. So what I would say to a lot of people is, attention is the number one asset. I left corporate 2019 to start a consultative creative service. I work with the finance industry, you know, creating content that gets people's attention, right? And it's been awesome for me. About 18 months ago, I created a marketing group where I meet with folks to consult them. And, you know, the creation takes a lot of time as you and your team know. So of course I created a group where I meet with these guys twice a month. I've been doing it for 18 months. It's become 15% of kind of my revenue. But boy, the evenings in which the evenings prior, I've become really uninspired by it. Yeah, and you're dreading doing it. Yes. And not because these guys are bad or anything else. It's just that, bro, what a great opportunity. This could be a great, I'm so high core. You're such a good dude. And I'll tell you why you're a good dude. I already know. You made this commitment to these people. It represents, and it's 15, you know, they're selfish and selfless, right? It's 15% of your revenue. So that's money, but it's not gonna destroy you. It might take some luxuries out. And you feel like you made a commitment. And I don't know what the timeframe or how it's structured. Brother, you need to shut it down. And I mean, today, can you afford the financial hit? 100%. Then there's no conversation here. You can be very gracious to these guys and gals. Do you feel any guilt to shutting it down towards them? Or they just, you made no over, you didn't say like you're gonna do this for 30 years. Like you made no promises. No, and just the context, like I feel like I'm diluting my brand by not being inspired by it. You're diluting your life. Fuck your brand. If you're not in a good place mentally, nothing is going to happen. If you're like waking, if you're like up the night before dreading to do this, it sucks. Dude, I got Ds and Fs in school, Cork. But what about like, if I extract, you know, zoom out, I'm like, well, that's how many thousands of dollars? Like what if I push harder and grow even more and it becomes 30, you know what I mean? You're gonna be more miserable because then you have golden handcuffs and you're stuck like 50% of this audience. You're about to walk into the thing that more than half the audience is watching right now is trying to get out of. You got to get out now while it doesn't completely own you. What do you mean what happens if it becomes 63% of your income? It's gonna fucking own you. I guess the- You know what else is gonna happen? You're gonna take all that energy, let alone time, and do something else that's gonna make you more money. I think that's the part of it, dude, that I was like struggling with. I'm turning away consistent income. Only 15%. You're actually turning away more consistent, upside happy income for less income that's consistent, but you hate. People always fear without realizing that if you're not in a good place, you have a cap. Do I think you can make this four times bigger? The answer is yes. In my intuitive gut right now. Do I think that would be the worst thing that ever happened to you? Yes, because it's gonna own you. If this was 1% of your income, not 15, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. Absolutely. Well, what the fuck are we talking about then, Cor? I respect you and wanted your opinion. I love you. I'm pumped, brother. I'm so positive about this. I couldn't even comprehend any other alternative. You need to shut this the fuck down. The mental hours, how long do you do it every night? How often do you do it again one more time? It's two hours a month. Right, the two hours a month might seem small. What about the nine and a half hours a month that you're thinking about it for five minutes at a time, 15 minutes at a time that you're dreading the upcoming two hours? And what about what that 11 hours reallocated to going on offense versus defense? You're full defense, bro. No, you're right. It was like someone said to me, they're like, why would you turn down hour much like? Is that person that told you that happier and more successful than I am? No. Well, then let's move on. The whole, I love that people take advice from people that are losing more than the person who are giving the advice to is. Forget about me. Pay attention to who gives advice. I remember this being advice you gave to Mike Vakanti years ago. Oh, bro, I can't believe you just fucking said that. Do you know I think about Mike Vakanti a lot? Mike Vakanti, everyone is my trainer. Corey, Mike is so happy and is so like not doing what he could be doing financially, but he's happy as fuck. And it's leading, and I'll tell you where he's at, where you'll be. I could see in his eyes now, he's starting to, you know, he's making me do my better form on my fucking whatever. He's like starting to creep into like talking about his next thing or what else he could. It ebbs and flows, but unhappiness is not a sustainable framework. Yeah, I know and I believe you. I got to ask a quick background. So about a year and a half ago, I was working my way up the corporate ladder. I'm pretty young. I'm only 29, so I was like 27, 28 then. I did the thing. I was a regular organizations coordinator in a healthcare position. I went up to a team lead position within about six months. Within another three months, I went up to the supervisor position. So I thought I had like made it and that that's what I was supposed to be doing. But I was completely miserable. I was working 80 hours a week. I was on salary getting paid less than I've ever made with the company. So it just, it wasn't working. It wasn't the move for me. I couldn't, I made the mistake because of the big, at that time I didn't know the difference between a supervisor and a manager. So I was thinking about the extra vibe and then got stuck in supervisor. So I realized that's not for me. But in that time, I managed to do what everyone told me not to and I burnt myself out. I was working way too much. I was doing on the side. I was doing a podcast with some friends. It was really good at the time. I really liked it. It was called Project Grown Up. I was also doing some freelance proofery and stuff like that on the side. So I was trying to, I was really- You were going hard. Yeah, I was going hard on my Gary V stuff. I was listening to Gary- I want you to hear something, Aimee. You were not going hard on your Gary V stuff. Yeah, no balance. No balance. No happiness. There is no balance. Everyone's balance is different. No happiness. When I say go hard, I always, always, always, always add in if you love it so much, it doesn't feel like you're going hard. People separate my words. Aimee, I can't go hard on anything. I was the worst student of all time. Aimee, do you know that I went through four years of high school without doing a single piece of homework or studying? I literally went my sophomore, junior, senior year without opening a book. A book. Zach, I did not open a book. I would bring it home. I'd have fun with my mom covering the book with the paper bag and drawing on it. I can't go hard on handy work around my apartment. I hate it. I can't go hard on that. You can only go hard if you love it. Otherwise, you will crash and burn. Yes, so that's exactly what I did. I crashed and burned. And now my problem is I can't seem to bounce back from that. I will, like I also have a lot of mental health issues. I take medications and stuff for my own. Everybody's got their own stuff, you know? Yeah, I do. But maybe if I get the right meds, that can fix me up a little bit. But I honestly just think that- No, no, no, no, no, no. Did you listen to the prior thing, the word yet? No. Where you listened to the last Q&A, where I was like, you haven't, to the barbershop car wash guy or no? I would have heard that. You were getting set up, got it. So, Aimee, you just haven't gotten it right yet. And I don't even think, listen, I have no interest in speaking to people's medical conditions. I don't know those things. But I can tell you right now, even your spirit is so bright on this call. You're a winner. You just literally haven't, what you're doing is so classic. You had the supervisor thing, so there was title, there was guaranteed money coming in. You chose happiness. I applaud you for that. Can we clap it up for her? Thank you. Aimee. Thank you. Thank you. Aimee, you chose happiness. And now you're trying to reset, and maybe you don't have a couple of things you have before, a title, the steady income yet. But yet, it's a foregone conclusion. Once you've had it, you'll always have it. You were clearly capable. So I'm trying to do what I, so when I told you I did the podcast back then with some friends, I was pretty good at that. And I got a lot of compliments that I did good research, that I held a good interview, stuff like that. I really like getting to know people. I like to have a story. I'm a very empathetic person as well. So I feel like I could potentially do some interviews and relate to people on different levels than they've done in other interviews. So I'll get the ball rolling with that. Okay. You know that's hard as shit though. Having a successful podcast is hard. You need to do that for your joy and then make me over time. It becomes something, but you need to take these incredible people skills and deploy them against job as well. The job, I don't know what job is good enough for that. Like I'd be great working at a movie theater. I'm great with that. So go work at a movie theater. It doesn't pay enough. I'll just have to price you down here. I'll just say, I think it's a great, like it all becomes a game of like, what are you trying to achieve? The question becomes very simply, like can you live within the means of something that makes you happy? 60,000 a year is enough if you live within a $60,000 a year lifestyle. It's not if you live within a $180,000 a year lifestyle. So you also know like, what do you want money for? Yeah. Well, I would eventually like to just get it to a point where I can do something that I enjoy for work. So I can love what I'm doing every day. Like you kind of talk about. So I would like to get- Go ahead, go ahead. If I could get to like doing the, if I could just keep this day job that I'm doing for the next couple of years, I can get through that if I have something joyous on the out, on the out. You believe, well, but that didn't work for you last time. You had that before. You had a job as a supervisor that you didn't like, but you had this podcast that was joyous, but it didn't work. Yeah. Why not just make your job joyous? That's the hard part. Ish, if you decide it's hard, why don't you just spend all your time applying to things that you theoretically think could work for you? Like the reality is you would like anything if the environment at the job was good. You're a people person. Yeah. There's a lot of people at Vayner right now that love their job, but they don't love love advertising the way I do. They just love the people around them. Okay. I think you're looking for a good work environment potentially. That makes me think I need to go back to the office because right now I'm working from home. By the way, Amy, most people need to go back to the office because of just the human part of it. If you're a people person, it's really nice to be back in the office. That's true. Not everybody's a people person, but a lot of people are. I just feel like it takes away like you got two hour commute. It's one hour there, one hour back. That's two hours of my day. I could be doing something more productive. But you're sitting at home and being miserable. Yeah. So the fuck are we doing? That's true. You like music? I do like music. Well, fucking listen to music for an hour each way. It's a fucking joy. That's pretty good advice. Amy, people make up things in theory that they think are smart when they're not smart at all. People love to create a theory of like, oh, commuting one hour each way is a bad idea because their friend said it, you know? Or like they hear it in society or like they worry about the gas cost. I understand how people's brains work. But like commuting an hour each way might not be bad for you, especially if you decide the commute's awesome. I miss commuting to Wine Library, Amy. I called my mom every day. Best thing I could be doing with my time. I fucking listened to sports radio and would like yell at fucking Mike and the Mad Dung and be like, you fuckers are wrong, the mix are. Like I put in bone thugs and fucking harmony and listened to it and banged the first of the month. I enjoyed it. Did I love being in traffic between New York and New Jersey and the fucking GW? No, but because I was good, I wasn't mad. If you're fucking mad, you're gonna be pissed about everything. You're unhappy right now. Don't tell me about the theory of annoyance when you're unhappy. And guess what? You're allowed to change your mind. Go do it. And if like in six months, you're driving for 40 minutes on a one hour commute and it's like a huge accent. You're just sitting there and you're like this fucking blows. Then you can be like, you know what? Fuck Gary Vee, he's wrong. I'm quitting. And then you can change your mind again. All right. So don't wait and do this miserable job and then wait till the podcast works out and then I can be happy. I should just try to find something that can make me happy now. 100,000% because that's not gonna work. Okay. All right. Thank you, Gary. I appreciate you. I appreciate you too, Amy. Tell everybody who you are, what you do. What's up man? My name is Ryan Trey from St. Louis, Missouri. Currently in Atlanta, I'm an R&B rap artist and I'm super inspired all the time by you and your whole team. Everybody. Everybody's back. R&B track baby. Yeah, R&B track baby man. But yeah, I appreciate you. Like having me pull up this time. You got any quick question while I'm doing this whole Q&A in Sanity? Yeah, I just turned 25 on the 27th of March. Happy birthday. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate it. But I want to ask you like, just do you remember where you were 24 turning 25? Like, oh, it's like a super pivotal moment. Like in your entrepreneurship and like just trying to like get everything. When I was 25, the biggest thing I was scared of in the world is the Y2K bug. Yeah. I'm being dead fucking serious. When I think about 25, that whole year was eaten up by literally 24, 25 was eaten up by ifwinelibrary.com goes down and if our registers go down, I'm going to be out of business. Honestly, bro, I was in the middle of my grind back then. I was like not even living for anything other than to make my parents proud and to help my parents. 24, 25, 26, 27 for me was 100 hours a week in the liquor store, building wine library, being happy as shit. You know, like not worrying about what my friends were doing. Like I grew up in Jersey, like everybody would go down to Jersey Shore, people hooking up, sending me photos of who they're hooking up with. No jealousy, no envy, no concern, just head down grinding was fulfilling a dream of mine for the last 10 years of like really doing it for my parents. And about 25, it was starting to get obvious that I was that guy. Like it was starting to really build. And so yeah, nothing, there wasn't anything pivotal other than the thing that I would tell you. Every minute you spend at looking at other artists on the gram and TikTok that are popping that you think you're better than, is a minute you're not spending on becoming better than. That's facts, yeah. Got me? So what I would tell you right now is you know how talented you are. You're gonna be sitting here right now if you aren't. Like you just need to make sure that envy, jealousy and lack of patience doesn't take you out. If you're driving, and this is where everyone's getting fucked up of looking at everybody else's life. If you're driving a car, and if you're looking at everybody else while you're driving, you're gonna fucking crash or drive off the road. You need to fucking drive your fucking road. Don't fucking look. And it doesn't matter if somebody who's corny popped off and went viral on TikTok. And it doesn't matter if somebody sang the hook for the new Drake spot that you were like, I was coming up with that person, I'm better than that. None of that shit matters. Nobody's taken from you. All right, yeah. Your envy and jealousy and lack of patience is taken from you. And that's what every 25 year old is going through right now. Gotcha, yeah, that's exactly where I'm at too. It's just trying to stay like in one lane, like the comparison thing, it can kill you. Especially like in rap, the super comparison. Not especially in rap, bro, especially in life. People are like, no, but Gary, you don't get it, especially in rap. And then people are like, Gary, you don't get it, especially in the legal business. Like it's not like rap where they could just do like, if I don't get this spot, then I don't get it. And Gary, you don't get it in teaching business. Like there's politics with the principle. Like everyone's saying the same, especially in. Whatever they're in is the especially in. That's how I get it. The envy, the jealousy, the distractions, the measuring up to others. It's like sports. If you're crippled that you're down 41, 21 in the early second quarter in a basketball game. And you're like, well, that's it. They're up 41, 21, then the game's over. Too many people are like, yo, I'm behind, I'm behind. My dad was already this, my parents, you had a house. My mom already had a child. My friend already had a million bucks. Like that shit, nobody else's life has anything to fucking do with you. Yeah, that's right. I appreciate that, my brother. Sure, for real. Really, glad you came through. This will go into the entrepreneurial side because I think that's where I'm meant to be. But currently right now I'm in that corporate world. I make a good salary. So you feel like you have golden handcuffs, right? Exactly. Yeah. And my wife went back to work full time. Like she's watching our kids for a while. So we're making more income, but based on all the things you see every day of making some bad financial decisions when we're younger, it's still really tight as far as day to day. So you got those golden handcuffs of like, I'd like to make a leap in the room. How's your weekends look? Are you guys all in on family time? You just rest? Like what, you know, when I hear golden handcuffs, when I look like I don't have optionality, I always go to nights and weekends because it just depends on how bad one wants it, right? And like how much is it eating at them, right? I don't think everyone, I don't think anyone should do anything. Meaning like everyone needs to live their life. Everyone lives different lives. Like if this is something, when you say, it's where I feel like I should be. You know, the question becomes, like for example, in your scenario, I see one in the background in a photo, like you have one, you have three, how old? What are they, 15, 12 and eight? So nice ages for what I'm about to say. Do you have any sense of if any of the three of them are entrepreneurial? Absolutely, my oldest right now is, she has her friends coming over, she's doing nails, she's charging them. She's always hustling candy and snack bars at school. So absolutely. We've opened up VaynerMedia in Toronto. We'll probably open them one in Vancouver, but Calgary and Winnipeg and Edmonton are not at the question one day. So if the timing comes right, we would love for her to intern because that's my kind of gal. I would highly consider starting an entrepreneurial venture that integrates the kids working with it so that you get family time and entrepreneurial time on weekends and even potentially at evenings. And that might be a way to put in enough time to give a side hustle the opportunity to turn into a full thing. Right, Noah, that's a great idea, incorporate them. I've started doing, I love thrifting. So I started selling on eBay and Facebook marketplace a little bit, so I do make a little bit there. That's more of a passion thing. That's more fun. That's a perfect side hustle. You have to go, I mean, look, you can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year doing that, but that you're full time, but it takes time, there's a lot to that. But what kind of side, like what entrepreneurial thing would you do? Yeah, like I'm big into the outdoor. So part of the inspiration you've given me is I started doing solo canoe trips. I like the solitude and going out on my own. It just leverages a lot of my skills, but I started the YouTube, Instagram, and as a marketer, I've held senior roles in marketing. I know I'm doing a shitty job, but that's not why I'm doing it. I'm just doing it because it's fun for me. And then my kids and family can see what I'm doing. And it's just a passion. So I don't want to make it work at this point. So I'm building a small community and meeting some new friends. So that's been great. So I have a bunch of ideas in the outdoor space. And it doesn't really matter what business I do. I just know I need to do one. But where I'm challenged is, trying to make the extra income, which yeah, on the weekends, evenings, like... Eva Barbara, excuse me for one second. Eva Barbara said, I've tried to incorporate them, but they just don't want you 17 and 14 years old. That's where I was leading. Yeah, but that's fine. You don't have to... But even our spouse of that too, like if you look at cutting, it's that balance, right? They see their friends going on trips, doing stuff and buying stuff. And it's kind of like... Well, yeah. The faster parents can teach their kids that other people's lives have nothing to do with your life. That's a great gift that most parents are really bad at in today's world. Like other people's lives have nothing to do with you. Like we've got to get back to parenting in the 50s and 60s style with the old, well, if Johnny's jumping off a bridge when you want to, like we've got to get to that. That's similar to the joke I made earlier. Like if you're listening to advice from your crackhead friend, like that's a bad source. When someone's like, yeah, but Karen's parents, they go on such great things. You're like, you don't know what's going on in their household. We had somebody on, oh, I'm sorry, it was my morning meeting. I had a morning meeting with someone who said, Johnny outside world, everybody thought my family was the best. As soon as the door closed, there was mental abuse, drug abuse, physical abuse. Like deciding that somebody else's life is good. And like, to me, like you've got children at the age now where like really leaning in and making them understand, like if you want that one day, then you'll be able to go and achieve and build and do those things. But like their life has nothing to do with your life. And like, I just think we're way too much into like keeping up with the Joneses. It's a fucking pandemic. Right, right, right. And just quickly. On the other side, I apologize. What I was going to answer earlier is you shouldn't force your kids into it. Meaning like you should show them paths. You should not create entitlement. Like one of the great ways to get people like, I can't get my kids to work. I'm like, stop giving them money. I've got a really interesting answer to a very complicated question. There's a lot of parents right now that have 13, 12, 14 maybe more, universally 14 to 24 year old kids that their number one DM and message to me is, I can't get my kids to work. And my answer is always, this is the easiest question I'm asked. Stop giving them money. Yeah. That makes sense. Everyone, parents are such fucking hypocrites. I know we do it all the time. Johnny's fucking, he's so fucking, my kids so fucking lazy Gary Vee. Like they think they're impressing me. I'm like, hey, they're like, how do I get them to fucking get his ass off the fucking couch? I'm like, stop giving them money. Yeah. Yeah. I know I agree. We speak out of both sides of our most sometimes. At scale, Mike. Yeah. Now, real quickly, I don't want everyone to hate me because I'm like taking up your time. But I'm doing it. I'm doing it. You're good. So now one question where my wife always says, like you have these great ideas, I think you should do it. You should maybe, you know, look at family or friends or try to get money to go out at a bit harder and look at boring. And I'm always like, ah, but I just, I just, You're scared to lose your, Well, and I'm just like, I want to know that I could do this myself. That's a bad reason to do it. Your wife's right. Yeah. That's evil. I'd love to hear that. Well, of course you will. But, and that's why I did it. But now let me go a step deeper. I don't think that's why you don't want to do it. I think you might fear the failure and then owing someone, like asking your friend for $25,000 and then going, having the business fail, is how you lose a friendship. Or even if your friends epic and understood what they were signing up for, there's still a level of shame that you would feel and it would change the relationship, right? Right. And I'm empathetic to that. I hate raising money. Yeah. But she's not wrong and go, oh, by the way, if you think you can do it, then your friends are going to love you. Yeah. Cause you're going to make them money. Now the question becomes is how much of a real entrepreneur are you? Or do you just have entrepreneurial tendencies? Right. Good question. So anyways, thank you so much, Gary. I love you brother. I love you. Yes, you needed us. Well, thank you so much. Appreciate the opportunity. I'm pumped, man. I love your energy. I'm excited for you. Just keep being this thoughtful. Always pick optimism. Like, no matter what happens, including you raised money from everybody and it famously failed, life is still going to be fine. This is not what people, money is not the thing people care about when they're 90. No, for sure. And one thing you've given me is I'm 44. I'm just getting started. So I'm trying to get my key. What's up? How you doing? Good to see you. How are things? Such a pleasure. Thanks for being here. Tell everybody who you are. Hi guys doing. I'm a cue ball cards. My name is Benson. I've been making social media content for the last four years, mainly around trading cards. So mainly like Pokemon, UDO, I've dabbled a little bit in Dragon Ball, big fan of custom cards, a lot of artists, very talented people out there. So. For sure. Yeah, working toward becoming a full-time content creator. I love it, brother. Where do you live? New Jersey. Here. Hazlet. Oh yeah, I know. That's awesome. So I'm not a four community. Not at all. Any questions while you're in here? Local? Yeah, I've got a question for you. You've definitely been an inspiration for me. I actually found your content by accident a few years ago. A lot of motivational stuff. And I was like, man, this guy's really helped me throughout the time in my life when I need it. And then next thing you know, like I'm going to Comic-Con and all that. I find out about V-Friends and everything, like your big entrepreneur. So I just turned 30 a couple months ago. So my big goal, as I said, has become a full-time creator. That's been the biggest dream. So I got to ask, what made you step into the creator space? And what keeps you going every day, even on like, maybe it's your down days? Yeah, I mean, we all are human beings that are challenging down days. I like it. The reason you want to be a full-time creator is because you like Yu-Gi-Oh! You like Pokemon. Like TCGs. You like it. Which would mean you'd rather do it than manage a Walmart or be a loiter. Or, right? Yeah, exactly. What keeps me going is I like it. What made me step into it was I'm obsessed with what I'm writing about in this book, of like, where attention's going. I saw something called YouTube. It was three months old. And I'm like, I have a funny feeling this is going to be big. I have to do a show. Because the only way I learn is by doing. I was going to do a jet show. I don't know if you know this. As a matter of fact, do you guys know this fun fact that AJ was the first blogger in our family? I made AJ do Jets TV. Because he was in college. I was like, AJ, you should do, this is going to be huge. So Jets TV started in August, September of 2005. And Y Library TV started February 21st, 2006. And he only did like eight or 10 episodes. There it is. You found it fast. Look at AJ. He's like a child. He was a child. So I did it because I saw that there was an opportunity. And then I fell in love with talking about things I loved. I did wine for a long time. Then I wanted to talk about business. And then everything I'm into. And the frame of business, and obviously that's where we overlap because I have so much love for trading cards and things of nature. And really genuinely feel like I have the absolute capability of actually turning V Friends into a meaningful IP. I'm not here for a few minutes. This is not, and this is not disrespect. I'm not treating this like a business, like let's say in Mehta Zoo. I don't know what happened there. But I'm doing this forever. Regardless of how good, bad, or indifferent it does. There's been good years of wine, library, and VaynerMedia. There's been bad years. This is something I'm doing and want to create these characters. So I'm excited about it. So yeah, I mean, I think, look, when I was 30, I worked at a liquor store. So you're just starting. I see your posts all the time on Instagram. I have those days where I kind of get a little down. What's your full-time job right now? Right now, I work in sales. Yeah. So like, man, honestly, that's good because that means that selling is always a good skill set. It's going to matter for you. It's going to help you on the career. You just got to keep, like honestly, excited for you to read the book because you have to just be better at content creation to create organic reach. How many views do your TikToks normally get? Well, my Instagram reels, they've been averaging anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 views per house. Right. So like, tactics that help you make that 25,000 consistently instead of 8,000 gets you closer to your goal. I asked TikTok not reels, but you went reels. Now I'm excited to ask you the next question. What do your TikToks get? When I was posting on TikTok. Let's talk about that sentence. Yeah. Why not? Discouragement. So to me, meaning it just wasn't taking off and you're like, let me focus on something. Yeah. Right. YouTube shorts? I do those a lot. How's that going? Pretty good. Good. Literally, the amount of time it would take you to slightly edit either a short or a reel into a TikTok to make it slightly more TikTok and do best practices of what I believe in here is like five minutes, 20 minutes. You have to get back. Were you worried that it made you not look big because you didn't have a lot of followers and you weren't getting a lot of views and you thought that would hurt you? Or was it literally just normal human behavior of like, actually being discouraged? It was actually being discouraged when I would post those clips and they were averaging around 500 views each. And I would start making comparisons to the other platform on Instagram and kind of swayed me more towards Instagram because I thought I had more success over here. Yeah. The difference is on TikTok, you're one video way of getting $4 million that changes everything and that's much harder to get on Instagram. I haven't go viral. Yeah. So I think there's, I think it's a huge strategic mistake. I appreciate it. What about engaging in comments on Twitter when people are talking about TCGs? Joining a random conversation where someone's debating about Black Lotus or talking about Charizard or something like that. How much of that, if any, do you do? So unfortunately, I'm not on Twitter at the moment. Band? No. Thankfully not. No. I gave it a shot a couple of times in the past. Same thing as TikTok, discouragement? Kind of. I couldn't really get behind the wheel of it. Yeah. The wheel there is to jump into conversations and show your knowledge and make friends, not make content that goes viral. Makes sense. Do that there. Make TikTok. You'll be in a totally different place in six months. Because if I heard you right, you want to be a full-time creator. Correct. You know what? It seems like you're in pretty good shape. You know how some dudes only work out their upper body and they look all fucked up? Right? They're like diesel and that's who you are as a content creator right now. By not focusing on Twitter and TikTok as well, especially in trading cards, you're top heavy. You're fucking huge up here, juicing, and you don't have any fucking calves. What about threads? What's your thoughts on that? I think the reason you're asking that is because you were able to siphon over your followers from Instagram there and it feels a little bit more safe. It feels like a place that you can maybe do some damage because you got some action on Instagram. Kind of have half on that. Yeah. Got some followers there and then I had some conversations over there. Do you see that app taking off a little bit more? No. I'm excited to see if they do anything. It continues to trend down. Right. The conversation's on Twitter. You need to spend an hour a day because you have big ambitions. You would like to live a full-time life talking about TCGs. Right. You must have your actions match that. So I need an hour every night for you to go in and search and you are knowledgeable. So I can talk about Black Lotus and Charizard, but I can talk way deeper about the New York Jets. I can talk much deeper than Aion Rogers. Right. I can go very into Michael Carter's career as a slot corner. That's what you could do in Twitter. You can search words that are deep knowledge, magic, deep knowledge, you get deep knowledge Pokemon and get into conversations that will show those people your deep and they will become fans of your content. Makes sense. 98% of my tweets in the first four years of me being on Twitter was me replying to people not posting. I'm guessing that helped build momentum for you on Twitter. It's the single reason Gary Vee happened. You mentioned that when you say your self-worth is not attached to your success. Right. I'm telling you who you are as a person. That's right. I was wondering specifically what do you attribute your self-worth to because I'm really unsure what to attach my self-worth to. I feel that I got very fortunate and this became a realization to me in the last five or seven years that just the way I make people feel and the way that people feel about me and the way that the people that, and I'm talking about the people I actually know, the people in this room that are with me right now and definitely my family and friends I've had for a long time. I just enjoy the process of being a giving a nice person. It really feeds me. It's really how I identify. And so that's what I've come to realize really triggers me. And when do I get really upset? It's when I'm disappointed in myself when I maybe didn't show up as wrong as I could for someone or do something. I don't get upset when I lose in business, when I lose money. That's not the places I get caught up on. I get caught up emotionally deeply when I try. I just think a lot about coming through. I also think I'm a little bit over the top on that. I'm trying to get a little bit better at this. I have a little bit of a superhero syndrome that gets me into trouble, but I'm very focused on that. So that's kind of where I think my life's about. Do you know what I mean? I definitely don't think my life's about being a great entrepreneur and making money. Or if I buy the New York Jets, a lot of people think that's my dream. It was my dream when I was in fourth grade when I came up with it, and I've said it pretty much every day or at least every week since. But it is beyond not my dream. It's my enjoyment to try to achieve. I love the journey of trying to get the Jets. It's a challenge. It's a game. It's like beating Zell that you're wearing a Zell shirt. Trying to get to Gann in 1986 and beat Zell down when I came out was every middle school's obsession in my growing up era. And that like the burning the bushes and moving the rocks was the fun part, not actually winning the game. And that's who I've become as a human. So you would say that your character, in terms of who you see yourself to be is what you. Yes, but I'm very cautious to not be delusional and paint a picture of myself that I want to paint. It's why I pay so close attention to the people that are actually interacting with me and how they feel. OK, because I'm like, for example, so I'm a teacher. And I really resonate with what you see about school system and how kids, I guess, they need to be. Well, not need to be, but what type of education that would benefit them the most. And so I often give advice to kids. And so I'm very, I guess, well equipped to do that. However, I feel that I guess due to my many insecurities, I feel that I'm fake whilst I'm doing that advice. I know. Because you don't. Is that because you feel like you don't live it? Or do you think it's just a full framework of just actual insecurities? I think it's both, actually. I think, look, let me use sports as an analogy. Some of the greatest coaches in the history of sports did not play the sport. And so giving, there's a lot of things that I see as very clear observations because I consume watching people that I have not lived, that I'm more than happy to talk about as a hypothesis and an opinion that I think is a good idea. You predominantly see a different version of me. So does the world. I will do that in real life more because it's a safer space. In a public life, I really do talk a lot about the stuff that I know. That's why most of the books are very marketing specific. It takes that nature. But I have a lot of passions about perspective and confidence and insecurity. But the fact that we're even at a time in the world where you can speak openly about being insecure, that was unheard of of a man saying that 30 years ago. We've destigmatized a lot of things. Do I believe like an earlier call we had that we've gone too far and stuff? Yes, I believe in our destigmatization and acceptance. We've created many over the top, too far extremes of entitlement and we haven't found our balance. There's a reason that this book's cover is purple. It's because the world of politics has gone to red and blue and I love purple. There's a reason that my kid's book is literally, literally called meet me in the middle because if you're overly eager, being eager and ambitious is remarkable. But if you're overly eager, it's out of balance. Being patient is my most favorite thing to tell everyone. But if you become obnoxiously patient, now you're going into a word called, one of my least favorite things, which is an extreme version is complacency. And so I think that what I'm hearing from you is first of all self-awareness, which is massive because that's step one. I wasn't able to start getting better at candor until I saw that it was a weakness. So you're ready further along than many people on earth. Next, well, I can tell you, look, that's just you beating yourself up again. My brother, let me give you some real love here. The amount of people that are willing to go on a very big platform on the internet and say to the world, my many insecurities is further along in their journey than most people on earth. All right, so that's number one. Number two, the next thing you do, one of the things if you listen carefully to my content sounds like you do enough that this might resonate for you, but definitely for some of the people here, is I often hedge a lot of things with words. I'm like, if I or sometimes I believe or I've heard or, so one of the things when you're telling kids advice, you could say, look, I actually was never great at this, but you should do this. And I'm even working at my age of getting better at this instead of saying you should do this. That's how you eliminate your worry of being a hypocrite or being fake. Yeah. Yeah, I find that a lot of times when I am offering advice, it's from many sources, yourself included. And so I know there's validity to all of it. It's just, as you said as well, it's hard believing it's as well. Of course. For one thing is I know, I love your quote about being realistic and it's just being real negative, but because I've come from a background of just being cynical and made of all time. And so I know I'm trying to be positive. I still quite can't get there. Of course, because it's that upbringing, it's so ingrained in you, either DNA or environment wise. But again, brother, you are such a fucking inspiration for me, Drew. I don't even, I'm so happy right now. You don't even know what's actually happening. You are helping so many people right now and yourself. Do you understand that you're doing the only thing one can do? You're doing the only thing one can do if they were born into a cynical or negative environment or DNA structure. You're trying to get out of it instead of dwelling in it. Okay. It's incredibly inspirational, bro. Thank you for that. And I guess it leads to the whole gratitude thing as well, because I feel that I should be very gracious with feeling a lot of it. I mean, I think I feel it. I'm not too sure about it. Because I've been told before that, trying to chase gratitude is not really the, I guess, the way to go about it. Yeah, I don't know if it's virtue. It's not like I'm trying to be like a saint or anything. It's just like, it's just genuine enjoyment of positivity as an oxygen stream. I don't like to put labels on things. Like I don't like to over educate on these things, meaning like sometimes we get over philosophical. Like, I don't know. Like someone saying, it's almost like people trying to outthink each other. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Like, you know what I mean, Drew? Like that's almost everyone out philosophicaling each other. Like, you know, like, I get it. Like the deepest state of virtue would not be that. Like I understand how that could get there, but like, let me say this, it is never a bad idea to try to be a good person. Like what version of life is that, right? That's being a fake good person to cover up insecurity or to get someone in a bad way on a surprise. That's bad. But if your intent is good, then that's as good as it fucking gets. Okay. Thank you so much for that. Brother, thank you so much. You brought a lot of value to a lot of people that I could not bring without you being a part of this. I think a lot of people got real value out of this. I appreciate you. Oh my God, Gary. I, it's been like, it's been so long, bro. Dude, it's so good to see you, bro. Thank you, dude. I really want you to tell the thousands of people that are watching me across all the other platforms who don't know who you are yet, because you're gonna grow into all of them. Just tell them two seconds about you. Actually, a lot of them know, because that podcast we did, people bring it up to me all the time. How that podcast with you made them feel comfortable in letting their kids play Fortnite all the time. Oh, well, okay. Well, I also want to give unlimited love to your whole community that's watching right now. Yeah, we have 120,000 people watching right now. So we got a lot of people, we got a lot of people watching right now. W's in the chat for me watching. For Gary, I'm Clix, also known as Clix. I'm a Fortnite player and I stream on the side and I make content and stuff like that. Bro, you were literally living the dream of so many teenagers. How are you not letting the fame and the money fuck you up? Let's start with that. That's the first real question. Man, I thought I was the one interviewing you, Gary. I'm gonna be honest. You're allowed to, but I just really think you can help a lot of kids. And by the way, you probably don't have it fully figured out because you're a normal young person with that level of fame and money. It's always gonna fuck up shit and you're probably chasing the hookups. And I know you're a dude, you're a fucking living life. But like, there's at some level, like I'm just really proud of you. Thank you, bro. I appreciate that. I know you enough to know. And like, I'm just proud of you. And like, I'm really asking you, like how the fuck are you? Like, what do you think you're doing well or what is working for you that's allowing you not to completely go off the reservation and be a complete fuck up? Oh man. Well, I definitely think it's like the way I was raised. You know what I'm saying? Like the way I was raised with my family and all that, they definitely raised me to not blurs my money, number one. Like my whole entire family is like fully Italian. They're always like safe, safe, safe, put in the bag and invest and all that. So it's like making money. Like I don't really, I don't really be spending too much money other than like, you know, gifted myself some stuff every year. Other than that, it's like, focus on the career. Don't let anything get to you. It's all like, my main thing that I really focus on is if it's not gonna be a big deal in like a year, watch us over it in general. So that's the one thing that I'm like trying to work on, not really care about like the little stuff that's making me mad. And other than that, that's about it, Gary. I'm gonna be honest. How are you feeling about the competitive side of your career? Like you're a competitive gamer. Like, you know what, you're so unique because you're actually great at the game, but you're also such an entertaining streamer, right? Like, you know, the cliche thing in gaming is like, they can be a personality, but they don't have the skill set in the game. You really are unique. Almost like an Andre Agassi in tennis. Like the way when he came up in the 80s, 90s, whatever it was, like he was cool as fuck, but he also could play, which was, you know, do you recognize that in you? Are you proud of that? Is that something you try to work on? Do you get scared as you get more fame and opportunity and money that you might lose your skill set as being a top player? You also know that 14 year olds and 13 year olds are coming up. Like it's crazy that someone at your age knows that there's youngsters coming up that like have 100% of their time working on their craft. Like you did when you were fucking 34. Like what's your mindset on that? I mean, I always thought like the older I'm gonna get, the worse I'm gonna get, but now 19 years old, I feel like I'm honestly still in my prime. Like last, last championship was like one of my best placements in the best I ever played. I know, I'm so proud of you, bro. That was huge. What place did I get, Gary? Fourth or fifth or third? Wait, I thought he was lying. I thought you were lying. What the fuck do you think you're fucking talking to, bro? Damn. Bro, I'd pay the fuck attention. And I know some bullshit happened there where like you missed the spot, bro. I fucking pay attention. Damn, W Gary, I didn't know that, bro. I fucking got here by accident. I fucking pay attention more than every fuck around earth. Yeah, you gotta fucking know Gary. Damn. Yeah, but no, we got, we got fourths out of like millions of people, but that was like a super good placement. That was like the grand finals. I think we cashed out on like 50, 60 grand, but it's more about just doing good and keeping that up. So now in my career, it takes a lot more effort to do good since I was 13. Like it was 13, it was like, to be honest, it was just me messing around, having fun. And like I was winning and all that. But now it's like, I actually need to put in the work and I need to actually grind now that I'm older. Well, that's the part I'm proud of you. Like, right? Like the whole like, was this right? Like I think I was talking to one of your teammates and my team, like you like went to Germany for better wifi to prep for a tournament. Like you're putting in the work. Yeah, no, I did go to Germany. Was that right? I went to Germany for Hugo Boss. But then I streamed like 24 hours for and I, I knew Hugo Boss or in Germany, which is cool. I just appreciate that you're working on your correct. Like dude, again, I'm gonna say it again. I know exactly the life you're living right now. A lot of viewers here know and a lot of viewers don't know. You have so much opportunity to not be putting in the work and doing it right. And you're putting in, you're putting in the work, you're doing it right and I'm proud of you. Thank you, bro. That's a good question. I'm gonna ask you. Okay. You're worth over like $300 million, billions of dollars in companies and all that. Why do you, why do you care? Like why are you still streaming? You are streaming your whole entire day, 11 hours a day, once you already accomplished like all what you want to accomplish in life. Because I haven't accomplished what I wanted in life. My, what I want out of life is enjoying the process. Right? I've never been about the trophies. I just like the process. I like the practice as much as I like the games and I definitely don't like the trophies. I don't live for the trophies. I don't live for the cheering of the crowd. I live for fucking my process. I love being an entrepreneur. I love being entrepreneur. I love putting out content that might help someone else. And honestly, Gary V, me, is the person that I wish was around when I was 15. You know, we grew up in a different era than you did. We didn't have the internet, bro. I didn't have the internet. That's crazy. That is really crazy. Forget about Twitch, forget about social media. We didn't have the internet. I wasn't on the internet until I was 18, about your age. Saying that is, so for me. That is crazy. So for me, I love putting out content for make pretend 15 year old me, that I would have been affected by it. Think about what you answered. Why am I good? Because my family gave me good money relationships. Italian family, save, save, save. A lot of people don't grow up in that world. They don't get the luck of that. And so the way you get better in life is you find other people that aren't your family and you're upbringing that bring you value. I see what you're saying. So you're saying like, we see you as that someone who's gonna give us like inspiration to act, like how to succeed and all that stuff. And not even just you, just someone who doesn't have like a family figure giving them good advice. Look, at some level, like when you're in a good place, you wanna give and like I'm in a good place before I had the money and the recognition. Like all my homies that I grew up with, they'll tell you who I was in high school and college. I was always nice because I was already good. I was always happy. I was always that way. And so I get a lot of joy out of getting an email or DM from a kid of like this one clip meant this to me. It's like, you know this, you're living the same life and you're doing it from an entertainment standpoint or from a craft standpoint, teaching people how to be better or an aspirational standpoint that wanna be like you. Like this is why I think I take a lot of pride and why I pay attention to you is like, kids need people to look up to that are doing it a good way. Okay, I'm seeing that. I'm seeing that. So for the kids watching my chat right now, who don't have anything to do, they don't wanna go to college, they wanna do social media, they wanna do consecration, they watch my streams and all that. What is the best advice that you would give them to start or to make their first million, to make their first $1,000 and all that? Cause I can't, I can't even answer that question. When they asked me, I'm like, maybe like start on TikTok, start doing that, but you're business-oriented, you have that whole entire mind. So what would you sell all the people much at? So everybody, listen, first and foremost, and this is like heavy shit when you're 13, 16, 12, it's first about being self-aware. Like if you don't know yourself, you're dead. So like I get that everybody wishes they were as like, they wanna be a professional gamer, but you happen to be naturally good at it. And then you build your skills on top of it and put in the work. So natural talent matters, right? Natural talent matters and work matters. So what I would say to a lot of people is you've got to really put in the work, but deploy it against something you like or you're good at or you're interested in. Like if you're just doing it for the Lambo or the money, you're gonna get caught because you're not gonna like it enough to self-sustain. You're still putting in the work to try to be good at a tournament. We just talked about that cause you fucking like it. You just asked me why am I still working? Cause I like it and I'm good at it. You like it and good at it. You like it and good at it are the only two sustainable things. You've gotta have one of them, but the fucking Nirvana, the fucking Apex, the fucking tippy top is when you got both. And everybody who's listening in your world needs to understand, right? Understand that they have to figure that out for themselves. They can't want to be you or anybody else. They need to be themselves. And they gotta figure that out. They can be inspired by, but they're gonna have to figure out their framework on that. I want to be honest that, that, that hate, that hate Gary. I get that cause people look at me and they're like, all right, they want to become like a four night player or stuff like that. But they grind 12 hours a day and they're still ass at the game. So it's like, maybe, maybe it's just not for them. It's real. That's exactly what it is. Like I wish that I was a lot of different thing. I wish it could be the quarterback of the jet so I could win a Super Bowl. I wanted that, but that's not in it for me. And some people want to be standup comics and rappers and comedic influencers, but they're not gonna be chingillist. They're not as talented, right? And that's gonna be, now they could be better at standup. Like what people don't understand is the hard work is only a piece of the equation, but that doesn't mean you can't be better at it. For example, right? You know that if they're 12 hours at it, they're asked by your standards cause you're fucking one of the best players in the world. But they're way better than they were a year ago and they might've went from like the 13th or 90th best kid in their school to the second best kid. But that doesn't mean they're gonna win fucking tournaments. And they've got a ceiling. And by the way, that's okay. They could become a professional streamer. Stick with me on this, cause this is some shit that your world's not talking about. They can be a streamer that makes 55,000 a year and love life. They live within that because there's a lot of people making 55,000 a year being an assistant manager at a dollar general that it would have been, but that loves gaming that it would have been better that they made 55,000 playing fucking Fortnite or whatever the next game is gonna be or Call of Duty or whatever. So there's levels to this game, right? There's levels to this shit, Gary. Levels to this shit. So like, look, not everyone's gonna make millions like you at it, but they might make 130,000 a year in Twitch revenue. And that might be a remarkable life and real talk. They may end up being happier than someone who makes 30 million a year. 100%. Like, so there's different levels to this shit. Yeah, no, you're right on that. You 100% right. Well, question for me though, aside from the streaming and all that, let's just say I have a load of money, right? And I'm already into real estate and I'm already doing stocks and all that. What would you invest millions of dollars in right now, 2024? That's you think, like obviously nothing's promising, but that you think is gonna go up in the next five years. I think understanding your situation, I think a couple of things. One, investing is tricky, but like I'm very, very bullish internet companies. Like the world is only going more technologies and I think they have big advantages. So the best tech companies in the world, the apples, the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, they're really nice. I don't think there's no such thing as a safe or guaranteed bet, but if I was really investing and I didn't have a deep passion for something. So let me tell you about me. I'm very high risk when I do some investment. I like investing in early stage companies. I'm okay with using the money to go to zero because I get enjoyment out of that. I wanna be me, but if you were really asking me and I'm answering you if it was just me and you and dinner and I'm letting everybody watch, I like internet companies because they have big advantages because the world's going more technology, not less. Okay, so you're saying startup companies, are you saying startup companies or companies that are already big and you see already becoming more big? I feel like you're asking a question from your point of view, like actually you. So I'm giving you an answer of what I probably do to diversify if I was you. I wouldn't say like, you know, you're obviously getting your money probably managed at this point, given the size and scale that you're at. But if you're asking me, like real, there's things that are tried and true. The best innovative companies as public stocks that are mature companies tend to do well if the world keeps heading in a technology place. And I think we're gonna have acceleration. I think the big tech companies are gonna have big advantages in AI because I think the government's gonna wanna regulate it. And there's so like, so I'm just trying to think through that stuff, but like the reality is, is investing is always hard. And by the way, for the first time, you have money at a very good time clicks. You can actually make money on your money, T bills. You can get real interest on your money. That didn't exist five years ago. But Gary, this is the thing, dude. This is like, I'm just gonna fool be myself. Like, dude, I'm investing all my money. I'm getting like a 6% return on my money, right? Which is good, right? Which is really good. My dad and my team always says that's really good. But it is really good. Transparently, I don't see as good. Like I wanna be making a lot more. You got what I'm saying? Of course I do. So then, cause you're trying to do what I'm trying to do. You should tell your parents or your dad and the people that you should literally take a percentage of that, a small percentage. Like you should be allowed to take a million dollars and invest it in very early stage companies and try to get an 8,000% return. That's what I'm talking about. That shit would be the shit that gets me going. Of course, but by the way, to make 8,000 or 800 or 500% with 5x, 15x, that means it's very likely, very likely that it's gonna go to zero. Yeah, so the numbers should lose a mill. Well, that, and you know, again, and for everybody, whether it's $5 or a million dollars, if it's a percentage that you're able to lose, that's when you go high risk, high reward. When it's not, then you just take your small, that's fine. I'm not on your level yet. You know, if I lose a mill, let me tell you, I need to get out of here. So then maybe you need to decide to only put 100,000 into ridiculous high risk, high reward. I'm messing, I'm messing. You're right. I know exactly where you're at. Hey, hey, hey. Bro, I don't wanna blow up your spot. I'm keeping it humble for you, bro. I know exactly where you're at. Hey, listen, dude, I'm trying to become like you, Gary. I'm gonna be honest. You have the point where you love life and you have, fuck you, money, bro. And you have, fuck you, respect that. When you, this is not about the money, but when you walk in that room, bro, the amount of times where I'm with you, I'm gonna suck you off for a second. The amount of times where you go in a room and every motherfucker shuts the fuck up and just looks at you is actually insane. Like, yeah, I mean, I've been going to events with Gary in the amount of respect that he gets. It's like, you feel like, Gary, you go in that room, I feel your aura. Like, I feel the degrees changes in the room. I wish I was joking. I'm being dead ass, Gary. How do I get like that, dude? You're not even tall, though. That's the thing. It's not height, bro. You're not taller, bro. Listen, I'm six foot. Are you? Yeah, I'm six foot. Come on, bro. Wait, you wanna make a real bet that you have to come and we measure you officially in your 5'11"? Uh. Because every dude that says they're six foot on the dot is 5'11 something. Yeah, I might be 5'11. Maybe. But hey, I'm there. I'm almost there. So that's what matters. But back to the question. Bro, the question is you keep doing things, one of the things you do well, and I see how you move with these kids, you keep giving a fuck about others instead of just yourself, and not exactly that same thing's gonna happen with you, and you're gonna go there. Wait, you just said give a fuck about, don't give a fuck about myself, but give a fuck about others? That's right. I mean, it's not don't give a fuck about yourself, but the reason you're gonna be respected too is when you actually care about other people and you've put Ws on the board, then you're that perfect mix of when you walk into a room and good shit happens. They either like you for who you are or what they've heard about how you actually move behind the scenes, or they like you for being actually accomplished for doing things, but when you can combine them both, it creates that level of aura. Joe, you just said some, no, you need to repeat that because I thought it's the opposite, Gary. I thought it's fuck what people say about you, bro. Just keep on standing in line to do you. That's no, don't value other people's opinions so that you be, because it's triggering insecurity. That's right. But caring, actually caring about others is exactly right. Not being affected by judgment by people who don't know you, that's a different play. Okay, okay. I get it, I get it now, I get it now. I'm gonna bounce. New book is coming.
