Hey Gary, Mike Afney from Share It Through. When you talk about value and data, how much of the data we have access to, unlimited amount of data, how much of that is the value? Is 100% of it valuable? Is it 10% of that data valuable? I mean, you know what the weird thing for me is, I'm stunned, you know, again, I come from like selling lemonade and baseball cards and wine, so now I come into and I have a lot of clients that are CPG clients and I'm just always stunned. And a lot of people here are much more tenured and understand this better than I do. I'm fairly new to the corporate world. I'm just stunned how many people forget what they're trying to do for a living. We just get so on these tangents and it gets so inside marketing baseball, I call it. We just talk about our terminology. I mean, the data is as valuable as you want to make it as long as you actually understand what you're trying to achieve. So the clients that are most happy with the work that I'm doing by producing microcontent for social networks are the ones that are e-commerce, like Green Mountain Coffee. They know how many K-Cups they sell because of our microcontent. And so I'm writing a new book called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook and it talks about the formula of like setting this up because most of us in this room and in the world are in Right Hook, Right Hook, Right Hook, Right Hook mode, always pushing. So we need to find how to bring value. I think the data is super important, but I think we overuse data and I'll tell you one thing I very much believe about data. Data is post-game. It told you what already happened and I think we need to innovate more on our intuition and start using more EQ in this industry than just IQ.
