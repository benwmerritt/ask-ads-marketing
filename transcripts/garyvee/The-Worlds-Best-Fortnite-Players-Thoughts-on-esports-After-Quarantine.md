So do you anticipate being world class in multiple games? I think so, yeah. You got your perspective. I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? We have a very special guest, probably the youngest of our guest speakers today. We're really excited that Kyle Buga Geirsdorf is here. He is a 17 year old professional Fortnite streamer and player of the Sentinels Esports Organization. He has been crowned the Fortnite World Champion in 2019 by beating out 40 million competitors worldwide. And he outscored the final 100 contestants in the finals. I don't know if you guys have ever seen Kyle play, but the dexterity and the speed of which he works is just phenomenal to watch. Buga was also crowned both the PC rookie player of the year and the PC player of the year at the Esports Awards last November of 2019. Kyle, or should we call you Buga? We are so excited that you were here. He is at BUGHA on Twitter. Welcome to the show. Love guys, thank you for having me. It's so good to see you. We met last year at the Super Bowl with your parents and you have the coolest setup out of all of us. I have to admit. And very good taste and hoodie material. I'm very thankful for that Kyle. I appreciate the shout. Brother, first of all, it's great to see you. I hope you've been well. It's always great to see you instead of just texting. What's the biggest, from your perspective, as one of the great players in this space going through it, obviously having the iconic moment that a lot of you, like you were the reason a lot of people took note about Esports or that tournament you're winning and how big the prize money was. Obviously that made enormous news throughout the world. Like, what do you continue to like laugh in your young man's head when you hear people talking about Esports? Because you're in it. What kind of makes you snicker or laugh? What's the biggest misperception you think from the masses or the parents or the mainstream media or just like that cliche thing that always makes you kind of snicker of like, if they only knew. Yeah, I mean, it would probably be like thinking that all gamers are just these sit-behind-their-desk nerds, they don't do anything else. They just play the game 24-7, are unhealthy, all that. Like, that's just, honestly, it's not true, at least for me. But probably the biggest thing. And what about how you see the space evolving? What's the biggest difference in the macro space? And again, what's great about a show like this is we have CMOs and we have, obviously, after this a team owner, but like from just your perspective, from your eyes, what's the biggest thing that's shifting in the last six months or 12 months about the space, about, and by the way, even if you want to go into your own game player, things of that nature, like, what's kind of happening? Yeah, I mean, recently Esports has just been like evolving and blowing up. I've seen so many more businesses, organizations, just everyone's just getting into Esports now. Just it's growing widely. But for me right now, playing Fortnite, there hasn't been too much in the Fortnite scene, just kind of like a new season going on. But you see a lot more early popping in. What about, you know, this is probably going to be fun for people here, like just your perspective. What about the younger crew of players coming up, right? Like, what are you even seeing from like the 12, 13, 14 year old set and you're like, whoa, that kid, like, I think people, you know, obviously you're paying attention, you're seeing different ways people are playing. And I also know that you're expanding and trying out different games and things of that nature. Anything catching your eye as an innovation, like anything from a hardware, what kids are using or mindsets or strategies or any kind of nerdy, deep, like I know a lot of people watching who are players or ask racial players, so you can give us a different perspective here. Yeah, I mean, all the time players are evolving, everyone's getting better at the game. Like all the younger players right now are kind of coming up and pushing some of the older guys out. Is there so much more mechanical and they're like way better in fights and everything? So some of them are kind of dominating right now, but for me, I'm still hanging in there. Real quick, real quick, tell everybody how old you are and how old these young guys are, cause you know, literally you just delivered, I'm still hanging in there. And I think a collective 10,000 people just threw up because they're like, well, now what does this get? But like, but paint a picture. You as like an older guy or an OG, like what age group are you talking about some of the younger guys and where do you sit in comparison by age? Yeah, I'm 17 and in the Fortnite scene right now, that's kind of like middle age coming up to the like later ages. And the younger guys are like 13, 14, they're all coming up, but yeah, I don't know, it's kind of shocking. Like I'm 17 and I'm in the middle age group, kind of later age group in a game. Like that's just so weird. Kyle, your perspective, one last thing before we get to Rob, and I really appreciate you taking time to understand how busy you are for jumping on and giving us some firepower here. Do you think in esports, we don't think about LeBron, even though LeBron James actually talks about playing tight end in the NFL, like the magnitude of like the way professional sports, as we've known it, you haven't seen that crossover, your prediction, your own opinion of your own self. And I know you have great quiet confidence. So I'm just giving you the room to speak to that. The crossover ability, you know, Deion Sanders, Bo Jackson, two of the only ones who've ever really done it. Do you, as these games get established and we really see seven, 12, 19, 22 esports really capturing the attention of the world, do you personally anticipate certain kids coming along and being great at three or four? Do you think that's too hard? Your hot take, cause I'm genuinely curious about how that plays out. Yeah, so I mean like, I think a lot of it is just dependent upon the person. So like me, for example, any game that I'm going to, I'm always trying to improve. I'm always trying to get really good at it. I feel like that's just my competitive drive. So I don't know, I think it would be easy if you are that type of person, but if you're not, maybe you're just good at one game. But for me personally, I think I could be good. So do you anticipate being world-class in multiple games? I think so, yeah. And when you watch other people and you're just watching, have you seen some people? You think it is a psychological competitiveness? Oh, 100%. Yeah. And you don't think it's a hand-eye kind of core, like you don't, you think it's certain genre games will map, like this Fortnite map to being good at FIFA, or is that completely impossible in your mind of making that transition versus another game that has a similar format? Yeah, like if we're going to another like third-person shooter, I think it could translate really well. But I think it would take more time to get used to like a sports game or something entirely different. So. Understood. Well, Kyle, listen, I want to get to Rob because I think he's going to bring some great perspective for the people on. And I really appreciate you making the time and kind of surprise guesting here. So thank you. Thank you for having me guys. Hey, everybody on YouTube. First of all, thank you so much, so humbled for your time. I don't want to watch, but time is the biggest asset. So thank you for watching that video. If you got some value out of that, there's plenty more where that came from. Feel free to check it out.
