## Transcript
I think that a lot of people that are watching and listening right now, wait for the moment. And they have something good happen. They get a TikTok, they get three million views. They have a best-selling book. They have a co-sign from Hove where a million views on YouTube. When I was on Conan O'Brien in 2007 coming from a YouTube that nobody had heard of yet, and now I'm doing the Conan show, I'm like, this is it? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! The video went viral on the internet, and yet that was a tiny brick in the career of my life. Yeah, for sure. I think the way we think about how things work is you're gonna have this moment, and then you're fucking Beyonce. When in reality, that really doesn't exist. And so I think a lot of people get depressed because they worked hard for four years to get the moment. They get the moment, 40 million views on TikTok. They're like, this is it! And then three months go by, and they're like kind of in the same place they were with a little something more, and they can't handle it. I've definitely had moments where I struggled with it. You said like, I had this massive moment. I should be outta here right at this point. You know what I mean? Like, what is it still doing here? Because I've been in that place multiple times throughout my career, I've learned how to deal with it. And that's where the patience come in. I'm like, you know what? It's just not my time right now. But I'm gonna stay locked in, I'm gonna continue to work, and I believe it will eventually happen. Attention is the number one asset. VaynerNation, how are you? Another episode of Podcast with Friends, episode 14. This has been a really fun new journey. Kind of something that I've been excited about trying out in 2024. And I thank the three of you for being on the 14th episode. Really my purpose with this for everybody at home, if you're listening for the first time, or if you're watching live on Twitch, twitch.tv slash garyve, is my goal is for the three people that I put on to become friends. Cause anytime you get to spend 45 minutes, whatever you can, adds a little sum, sum. But most importantly, I want the people on this show to become friends with my audience, wanna spread the love to people that are doing interesting things, and moving in different ways, and just inviting people on the come up, or people that have done it to be on the show. So I thank the three of you for being here. And as always, we will start with ladies first on the intro. So I'm gonna give you a minute to say who you are, or two, if you wanna be a little greedy, who you are, and a little bit about what you do. And then we're just gonna chop it up. Okay, chivalry's alive and well. I'm Ariel Arcey. I, god, I don't even know how to explain myself. I feel like I'm an entrepreneur in the food and beverage space. The thing that I really do is kind of experiential dining. My first life was in the theater, so I kind of apply some of those techniques to restaurants. I'm born and raised in this neighborhood in Hell's Kitchen. Amazing. So I've spent my whole life kind of, for the most part, in New York, and opened my first restaurant about eight years ago, which is a place called Tokyo Record Bar. I spent my early career working with Champagne. So I have a Champagne Bar called Ayers. I opened a restaurant about five years ago called Nishnish, which is now Roshiole, which is an Italian restaurant from Rome. It's their first outpost outside of Rome, which is pretty cool. For us, food and wine nerds, that was a big deal. Not a bad move. I was pumped about that. Yes, I often get the, how did you do that? I say, I don't know. But what is the actual answer? We're getting into high value immediately for the audience. That's you being sweet and humble and cool about it, but what's the actual answer? The actual answer is- And paint the picture to people how improbable that was, like how hard it was to get that here. Like I think I want people to hear, because I was laughing. You very much are an entrepreneur, and that was a real coup. If you're nerd out in that industry like I do, like set up a, actually, I don't want to spend time with that. I'll set up for everybody. That was a really improbable move for them to open up an outpost outside of where they were. And you pulled it off. How'd you do that? Really through friendship, more than anything, I think a huge part of my success in this business is the people that I meet and get to be around and the people that I like to work with. And COVID played a huge factor in it for all of us, which is during COVID, I had a restaurant that was constantly bringing people from around the world together. And I got to work with all these amazing people who I never in a million years that I could pick up the phone and say, you want to do something, but everyone was really game. And during COVID, I invited them to come to New York. And this is after all the restrictions changed, and they came and did a week takeover, and we just became friends. And so over the course of the next year and a half, I was going to Rome, they were coming to New York, we were kind of dreaming of what we could do together. And this was a really kismet kind of organic situation. Two things that I want everybody here, from my perspective, and we'll keep it moving, and we'll keep building on this, is one, recognizing the moment. I know a lot about your career, so I can think of certain things I'm thinking now. We've had a nice conversation and I've paid attention from afar. I think recognizing them, a lot of people went on defense during COVID, especially in your industry. Yeah, and I did as well too, absolutely. Yes, but you also made an offensive move there of like, let's go and figure out some stuff. And two, I think the biggest issue for a lot of kids is they don't realize the longer they can hold their breath, the more likely they'll pull off what they want. Patience is important. It's such a big deal. Everyone's so goddamn transactional. The amount of people that I would be fully open to doing business with that lose on the initial second, because they just go in for the ask, too hard. Like you got a romance to do to a little something. Can you take me on a date? Like, you know what I mean? People trying to close me on the first second, like obviously I'm making the reference to girl and boy dynamics, but there's a lot of truth to that in business, which is like, if you're trying to close me on the first night and I don't know you like that, like we're not doing business. Yeah, I think you're a little bit, a little corny. Little, can I get a date or two? I also think it's more important as you have the experience of moving too quickly to learn that it is okay to take your time because we all wanna move very fast and we all wanna be successful at a young age, improve ourselves, improve things to ourselves. And my most, I don't know, successful moments have really been in the waiting and the seeing and the planning. You know, this is a relationship that we wanna build together. So that was the kind of move with this. Opening a business with a bunch of Italian men is such a fun challenge. And there is moments in that where you go, is this a good relationship? Is this 1982? Oh my God. I'm glad. Real quick, if I may interrupt, big shout out to Casey Culligan. Yes, I will be your Valentine's. If you're listening on the podcast, you can be part of the show by going to twitch.tv slash Gary Vee. Casey asked if I could be his Valentine's. So I see what he's doing there, he's trying to romance me. Right. Nigel, jump in. Ask it early, huh? My name is Nigel Sylvester, professional BMX athlete. Dreamer, entrepreneur, all around creative, New Yorker. I'm trying to, you know, make an introduction for you. No, but even what you guys were just talking about, right? Like that patience, right? And waiting for like that timing, you know, like similar. A lot of things that have been these big moments, these milestone moments in my career and in my life have come with me just being patient and being prepared and ready for the moment that presents itself, you know. Can I ask you, oh, I'm sorry. Of course, no, go ahead. I was gonna ask you an important question that I think you uniquely can answer, which is why I'm jumping in. I love your career for a very specific reason because I think it could be a real teaching for a lot of people. Patience for sure, right? We're already on it. I think people really get fucked up with the big moments. So you've had a lot of patience. You also have a ton of talent. Thank you. I mean, we've known each other for a long time now. And I was watching you for a while before that even happened. Like, because I watch how people move. Like, you've had some big cosine moments. You've had some big viral fucking videos. You've had big moments. And I think that a lot of people that are watching and listening right now wait for the moment. And they have something good happen. They get a TikTok, they get 3 million views. They have a best-selling book. They have a cosine from Hover, a million views on YouTube. When I was on Conan in 2007. When I was on Conan O'Brien in 2007 coming from a YouTube that nobody had heard of yet. And I'm doing the Conan show. I'm like, this is it? This is when I'm gonna go do that. And by the way, I also had a very unique thing happen. I crushed it and the video went viral on the internet. So not only was I on Conan, but because I ate dirt with him and all this crazy shit, the video went viral on the internet. And yet that was a tiny brick in the career of my life. Now back to patience. Can you tell the kids right now about, you've had like three, six, nine big moments that prior to any of them happening to you, or when you were a kid, you would have thought that was gonna be the moment that made you be stopped in every, like you know, I think the way we think about how things work is you're gonna have this moment and then you're fucking Beyonce. When in reality, that really doesn't exist. The amount of people that have like brick by brick, like you have 26 massive moments and now you're kinda stored, kinda getting on. And I think when people have that big moment and then a month goes, and they get a lot of heat, especially now. People going viral real hard, but then our ghost a year from now, like corn kids walking around like, yo, where's everybody at? Like you know, like you can't maintain. And so I think a lot of people get depressed because they worked hard for four years to get the moment. 40 million views on TikTok, they're like, this is it, I'm gonna get the age. And then three months go by and they're like kind of in the same place they were with a little something more and they can't handle it. Talk to me about having real moments, even though, but still being like in it. Do you know what I mean? For sure, man. Like you said, like I've had a lot of moments, right? You really have. I've been riding professionally for over 15 years now. You know what I mean? I feel like came out the gate as like quote unquote, like number one draft pick, right? I got signed by Dave Mira, which is the legend of all legends when it comes to BMX riding. And then I signed with Nike a few months later. And how old were you at the time? I was 18. Yeah, that was it. Like if I'm you, like I was watching that. I'm like, yeah, you're like LeBron Tiger. Like you're like, this is about to pop the fuck off. Go crazy. I'm like, it's about to go crazy. But at that moment I realized I had to continue to work even harder to maintain that thing. And like you mentioned throughout my career, I've had these crazy moments like a coast on by Hove and Pharrell and these massive, massive stars. You know, and like that isn't the end or be all. Like you have to maintain that now. Getting there is one thing. Maintaining it is a whole other thing. And then maintaining and continuing to build your brand, continue to grow. Especially as technology changes, social media happens, like things are constantly evolving. So you got to just stay locked in really and truly, man. Have you struggled ever in this journey of like, man, I've had all the, like, you know how it goes. Right. Up and down it, like right? Like have you ever had moments like fuck, man, I've had four to seven, 10 massive moments. How the fuck am I sitting here where like, I'll give examples like I don't have as many deals or like, like, have you struggled with that? Or have you been kind of in pocket and you're like, like you've calibrated that a long time ago and you're good or like, how does it go in your psyche? I've definitely had moments where I struggled with it. Like man, like you said, like I had this massive moment. I should be out of here right at this point. You know what I mean? Like what is it still doing here? But because I've been in that place multiple times throughout my career, I've learned how to deal with it. And that's where like the patience coming. Like, you know what? It's just not my time right now, but I'm gonna stay locked in, I'm gonna continue to work and I believe it will eventually happen. But what does our time mean? Like to you. To me, it's hitting one of those moments again. You know what I mean? Or it's that the entire brand levels up across the board. That's what I feel like is that time. It's funny you bring that up and I will go to you, Mosh. Where I got real lucky is I'm like fucking weird. I like... Oh shit. Yeah. I'm like on some like, it's really interesting to just hear you guys exchange. And this is like something I've been thinking. It's a very cliche common sentence. Like enjoy the journey, Nuth, right? Like I really like the bad more than the good. I'm not chasing the next big moment. I'm enjoying when I'm in the process of the next moment. Actually, my biggest flaw is the reverse. I'm not good at smelling roses. No, it's impossible. I'm like, when I get the big moments, when something remarkable happens, I'm like usually like, it's super weird. It's kind of like the way I am with my birthday. Like I hate my birthday and I like every other day of the year. And there's a lot of psychology and there's a lot to unpack there, but like I got very fortunate that I like the mockery and the pain like more than the... Yeah, the chaos is fine. It's kind of like the thing I envy in people that work out. Like I hate working out. I just want it to look good, but in business I'm the reverse. I like the pain and it almost like I don't even give a fuck if it's like six packs and I look remarkable. It's like, but in workout, I'm like, oh, this is how people live life. Like I get it why it's hard because this sucks for me. Say hello. Hello, hello. My name is Mosha Gershst and I'm really humbled that actually just sitting here with the three of you. Such a pleasure. I'm from LA. I've had three very distinct chapters of my life so far. I spent seven years as the lead singer of a rock band. I'm from LA. We were also assigned to a label at 18 and national distribution touring. Like actually, by the way. Like not like kind of like that. We got signed, but like, no, like actually. Right, it's fire. Yeah, it was great. I mean, that was an amazing time in my life. And then I went off and had a spiritual awakening at 20 and walked away from all of that. Like in the middle of tour, right? Do I remember that right? Yeah, we were about to go out with Good Charlotte at the time. Yeah, like trying to get everybody to understand like real, real, real. Yeah, actually, the truth is somebody asked me a question at our record release party. They asked, how long are you gonna do this for? Which is a weird question to ask a musician. Especially when you said, no more now. Like this is it, I'm out, stand. Peace. And this was before that. And I had never thought about an answer to that question. How long are you just do it? It's what you do. Why do you ride? Because you ride. It's who you want to ride. Why do you involve in the food industry? Because it speaks to you. So I'm a musician, when music's in your heart, that's what you do. And I said something to the effect of, we'll play until we're successful. And then I'll settle down. I always pictured myself a family man. And he said, when's that? I said, when's what? And he said, when's success? And at the time I told him to grab another drink because he was killing my buzz. It sounds like it. But I woke up the next morning and that question kind of burned in me like a fever. Like when is that? When is success? And that led me on this journey to, I don't know what I'm doing here. Like I never really thought about life beyond what I was doing. So I went and studied in Jerusalem for like, little over 10 years, studying, praying, meditating, about 12 years. Why straight to religion? I was raised in a Jewish home. That's like, probably had I not been in a Jewish home, I would have ended up in India. I was just like, you just go over somewhere else, right? So I went to this place and... Such a, by the way, such a common thing that I see in so many of my friends and contemporaries, very religious home. Then in their right, their early youth, they go completely over like, fuck you. They're about against me. And then somewhere along the way, like those roots are so strong, they find their, it's very, very common. I see it in so many, I have so many acquaintances, business relationships and friends who've been on a very similar journey of like, to the other extreme, to then like finding their way home. Yeah, and I kind of feel like that's where I am now. In like this third chapter, which was like real deep study in contemplation, really just trying to find myself and figure out what life was about. And then now it's been channeling that back out into the world. So all that time on stage and all that time on writing, when I write books, to me, I see it as like putting out another album. When I go out and speak, it's going back on stage. That's right. So it's really channeling what was into what is. And I love the fact that we've been speaking about patience till now, because that's for me like what this whole journey is. Like the more you can lean into that, if you don't need it now, but you can keep walking in the direction of what you love and in your dreams. So whether your dreams show up the way you picture them or not, you're gonna have some great experiences along the way. And I think I have an opposite disposition than you in terms of like loving the mud and like not being able to smell the roses. And I feel like I'm always smelling the roses. Like I'm so grateful. Well, you know, it's so funny. I actually feel like that, like to me, that is the point. It's actually the counter of what I'm saying is what I'm saying, which is my roses are the mud. Got it? My man. My roses are the mud. What I'm trying to do is actually just do the occasional like, yeah, something good happened. Like let's go out to dinner and like celebrate it. Like I don't even do that. Like it's kind of like, H.A. is actually here. I don't see him. Like he's starting to get annoyed with me. He's like, bro. He's like, you can't have like this, whatever the massive thing is. He's like, can we at least like talk about? Cause I almost over, it goes back to my birthday. I almost over correct. And I'm like, boom, like big exit of a big investment. It's like, like I almost make pretend it doesn't happen. It's almost because I'm so infatuated with the process. Let's take a hard turn. I want to do something that I haven't done in the prior 13 episodes. Now I want to go back again around the circle and I want to give you two or three minutes to talk about something you're genuinely excited about that's going on for you. That is almost like a selfish play that might be selfless in letting people know about it or might be able to show people people's excitement. And more importantly, this, my audience is pretty epic. One of the reasons I wanted to hear is people that like, books sell like crazy off this podcast. People, I have a really fun community and I want to try this. So please start us. Like what do you, of all your projects or all the things you're doing, like what would you, or like if it's as simple as like, you'd love them to follow your journey on your Snapchat cause you're doubling down on it. Like what would you like this audience and don't, you know, this is going to be listened to a lot over the next couple of years. Like I want people to discover you and I want to double click on that more in these episodes back to friends. And so I want to give you that room. What do you want people to know? What do I want people to know? Gosh. Well, okay. I will absolutely plug some things that I do. But before I do that, I do feel like for the first time ever, I'm just feeling much more comfortable in my personal self. Good. Which hearing all of your journeys, I have a feeling that we have probably similar ones, which is like, you don't actually enjoy those moments. You don't stop and say, wow, something incredible happened here with a lot of other people and we can enjoy that. And I think you take a lot away from yourself and you don't actually really like yourself that much. So for a long time, I think the idea of happiness was something that was really foreign to me. I didn't really think about like, am I happy? What makes me happy? So even though I love my work and I love all the things that I do and 90% of my life is my work, I'm finding much more time that I'm creating for myself to actually just do things that bring pleasure and joy and traveling is a huge part of that for me. And through my travels, I end up finding myself professionally inspired and that does create a lot of projects for myself. Going off the grid creates, yeah, it's huge. I agree. God forbid I went off the grid. We have these phones that are constantly keeping us connected all the time, but yeah. But you're in control of the phone. You are in control of the phone. People are in love right now. We're in a very funny era similar to the 30s. We banned alcohol in this country. Yep. Because we blamed the alcohol, we didn't blame ourselves. Like we're doing it right now with phones and social media. Phones and social media are the alcohol of this 100 years later. Yeah. We're gonna blame the shit out, we're gonna ban these apps, we're gonna demonize them. But a lot of it has to do with our inability to be accountable. Many parents would far prefer to blame Facebook and Elon Musk and TikTok than blame themselves. It's easier. And so this is definitely, like, whatever we're gonna go through here in the next 20 years, we're gonna unwind it because there's roots and there's causes. And like to your point, yeah, they're around. You can also throw it in the fucking ocean. You can. Yeah, I want to. All the time. And you should. And turn that shit on. You can though, right? Like, by the way, sugar owns me. I don't have to eat it all the time. I have pizza in that way. Yeah, like, it's, you know, like, I think that we, it's really fast. Like people are like, no, they endorphin, they hear like a headline. Like, but social media gives you endorphin. I'm like, you know what else gives you endorphin? Like everything. Like people with dressing, sexy music. Like, like people are so fun. People are the best. People are the best. We love people. But then I'll say thank you for giving me a moment to talk about, I have a caviar company. Okay, so first of all, you just turned something selfish into something very selfless. Caviar is my single, outside of English peas. My single favorite thing in the world to eat is caviar. I was raised to hate peas. So that's a hilarious. Let's arm wrestle. All right. You don't like peas? I do love peas, but the woman who raised me hated peas. So she tried to like, you know, convince me that I hated peas. And so it took me a really long time to come back to them. And I have a relationship with her. You said something earlier, I wasn't gonna jump in, but now what you just said, I just, again, I really do care about this audience hearing things. It was funny, like you said, similar journeys, things that's, and you said, you know, for a long time, you needed to find a way to love yourself. And it's really weird. I'm like, completely the worst. The woman that raised me, my mother, created a framework that I'm trying to figure out how to scale to the world through my content and my messaging. Like, I love myself in a way that has allowed me to love others at scale. That's beautiful. And so like, it's interesting though, even like the way you just talked that peas then caught me. Like the woman that raised me taught me to hate, like teaching people to hate things at a young age. Well, she also told me that my first word was, I'm pretty and like to love yourself. She just hated peas. Okay, God. It wasn't even that heavy. I was trying to go to school. I was trying to go to school. I was going, shoot the fucking deep. I was so hyped, I'm like, this is gonna be the greatest fucking moment of my career. I love that. I want to be one of them's loves. And I love your mother. Well, she just hated peas. I love it. I love it. English peas are my single favorite food. They are just elegance and grace. And when they're in season. What is it about the peas that you, like, you're so infatuated with? It's similar to sunflower seeds. I'm obsessed with some sunflower seeds in my top 10 as well. But I need them to be big. And English peas are big. Like I like the size of and the flavor. Like English peas are interesting. When they're too big, they like have no flavor. Like when they're in season and right sized, it's banana's flavor. But when they start getting out of season, and even when I don't, like even bad English peas are like delicious to me. But what is it about them? Like I just love the flavor. But cat, let's go back to it. You have a caviar cup? I have a caviar cup, babe. I'm like, I want to, I don't do influencer deals. And I don't do like, name-aged likeness, but I want to eat your caviar and post about it. Cause it's like, and I'll pay for it by the way. That wasn't a looting to, I want free caviar. But I'm obsessed with caviar. And I'm also obsessed with champagne. So I think you're doing a lot of things. Yeah. Things that I like. I like to take things that people think are luxuries and make them affordable and accessible and approachable. That's kind of been my jam. I think like a lot of people don't realize that you can do whatever you want in your life. You can spend your money however you want. You can have nice things if you want to work for them. And, or even if you don't want to work for them and you have money to spend on them or you don't, like just do what you want to do. And you don't have to justify that. And I think, you know, luxury has been positioned as you have to live a certain way and behave a certain way and look a certain way. To be able to have those things. Whereas I don't think that. So I have a caviar company that started out of my champagne bar where every year around the holidays, I just sold caviar at cost to anybody who wanted to buy it. That's amazing. And then during COVID, I was like, well, I know that this is the worst time to start a luxury food business. But apparently I was wrong. And people seem to want to buy all experiences en masse. So we started it in 2020, in the summer of 2020. And it's direct to consumer for the most part. What's it called? It's called caviar. My name is air. C-A-V-I-A-I-R. So instead of caviar, caviar. And what we do is the work to find the best quality product that I can possibly find and offer to you at the best price possible. By the way, it's how I built Wine Library. Everything you were just talking about is how I felt about Wine 30 years ago. And nobody thought Wine was cool. That was under 40. And everybody was so snobby about it. And I, it became my biggest passion of demystify Wine. And there's so much great Wine that's super underpriced. And I think that's cool, especially when you get deep into caviar world. That's super cool. I can't wait to check it out. Thank you. Nigel, what would you want people to go to, listen to, watch, follow? Well, definitely to come and check out caviar. When that happens, I need to do that. I was the director, so we can do it on your phone right now. Actually, I should be like, you had approved the Twitch that you just bought some, so get it on your phone. I think we were talking about it earlier, most of you, when you hand me the book and the first word I seen on the cover was intention. And I've been very intentional throughout business and throughout my career for a very long time. But I'm now taking an opportunity to be, to apply that level of intention to my personal life. And with the hopes to improve my relationships, be a better son, a better brother, a better friend, you know what I mean, a better listener. That's super important to me. You know? Yeah, because you were so ambitious, so hungry and so in your own cocoon. How old are you now, brother? 35. Not 36, look at that. Love it. So you literally lived one life all the way to that, you're 18, where you had these big moments, and now you're 18 more. You can like pop up, still be young as fuck, you still have 70, actually, years ahead of you, God willing. And now you're like, wait a minute, I understand what I was doing for myself. Let me take a beat here and make sure I'm given for especially people close. I love that. Now I mean, it's also like one of the quotes that I heard out of very young age, and I'm like Michael Jordan, he's like, it's okay to be selfish while you're chasing the goal and the dream. But when you get to that point, we should start a level of success, you have to be selfish and I'll give back. And that's been something that's, it's very important to me right now, right? And doing that work again, from a personal standpoint, but also through my foundation. So I launched my foundation in 2021, I just invested the foundation. And so how do people find that from a .com standpoint? It's Nigel, civestafoundation.com, it's Nigel Foundation on Instagram and Twitter. And we're doing work where like truly showing kids the power of bicycle riding. Love it. And empowering kids in communities through bicycle riding, and also through financial literacy. You know, like the things that you don't learn in school about how money works and things of that nature that these kids need. So that's like super important to me as well. And then of course there's the projects that I can't like really dive into because of the element of surprise. But we're working on some amazing things, you know what I mean? Like elevating the Go brand, you know, from the content standpoint to the product standpoint. And then Go Ride. So we did this event last year called Go Ride. And we did it on World Bicycle Day. And I wanted to create opportunity on World Bicycle Day to galvanize bicycle communities around the world. So I was like, man, like how do I do that? Like how do I do something that's big? It's international. So like we're gonna do a bike ride starting in London at 10 a.m. We're gonna ride 15 miles, jump on a jet, fly to New York, land in New York around like 6 p.m. and then do another 15 mile bike ride in New York. And it went off like nothing else. It was incredible. You know, it was an incredible, incredible moment. I have my bicycle tires on two different continents in the same exact day. And it now is becoming an annual thing for me. We're like getting kids out, riding bikes, staying healthy, bringing that community together. So it's something I'm gonna look forward to doing this year as well. So it's gonna be exciting. That's wonderful. Thank you. I think what I'm like most excited about in my life these days is that I'm spending more time with my wife and kids. There was this point where I did feel like there were a bunch of moments that had to happen for me to be able to step back, just to drop off the gas to put energy in other places. And my wife started working with me recently, which has been just a dream. So we get to work on all this stuff together. And maybe to piggyback on a line that you said, Ariel, you mentioned wanting to bring luxury and make it affordable to people. For me, everything I'm about is trying to take this deep wisdom that we all have, all cultures have, all spiritual paths have, but it gets lost in language, it gets lost in the archaicness of language, it gets lost in translation. It gets lost in politics. It gets lost in politics and in religion and it gets lost. And I wanna take wisdom and make it accessible to people. It's awesome. Really making it easy. We're talking about plugs. The books are really, I've been so blessed. You guys are the best. There we go. The first one, it's all the same to me. When that became a best seller, it's like that was a life-changing moment for me and my wife for sure, cause we felt like we did it on some level, like that first level of recognition. Of course. You're a human being, you write a book, you're like, I wanna be a best seller. You see, that's just a normal behavior. It was great. It's not like people start shit and they're like, I hope this is bombs. But it was exactly what you said. It didn't end there, it's not like, I was not Beyonce. I was like, that was a dog. I get it, I get it, I think about it all the time. Keep going. But all the pieces led to the next, right? So that book leads to the TED Talk and the TED Talk just recently passed a million views, which is like, that's also amazing. That leads to another book deal and everything builds one on the other, but life happens in between. 100%. That's where it's all happening. Your life is the dash in between the moments. And I think a story that kind of typifies my experience with this is on the flight, on the way here I landed yesterday. I'm sitting down and the guy sitting to my left speaks to, like a very chatty guy. He speaks to me for like 20 minutes, 30 minutes. He's talking to me about everything that's on his mind. And it's a 12 hour flight. Oh, that's cold. And after 30 minutes, like, well, it's nice to meet you. By the way, my name's Moshe. And he goes, my name's Max. He says, Moshe what? I said, Moshe Gersh. He's like, Moshe Gersh? And I said, what do you mean? He's like, I love your books. He's like, you have no idea. And he's like, I was just talking about it. You're like, keep talking! Right? Yeah. So we end up having a two and a half hour conversation. All of a sudden. About how much he loves me. I've always got time for that. Like, give me 12 hours. And it's just like amazing that you can be somewhere. And sometimes you get these winks from the universe, God's letting you know that you're making a difference and having an impact. You just don't know how far it's going. So, it's not like. It's also cool, if I may. Do you wanna say something else? Just how different the three of you roll. I think a lot about impact to your point, making an impact. Like how it comes in different sizes and shapes. So obviously spirituality, religion, wisdom, writing books, that makes so much goddamn sense. Right? Something I've been thinking a lot about lately is how much impact in a positive way, Randy the Macho Band Savage and Richard Pryor had on my life. And I'm not kidding. How much escapism and joy they gave me. Like entertainment is incredibly misunderstood. Like, you know, people, living life. Like, and I think we've felt it in the last seven years. The world's gotten heavier. Last 15 years. It feels heavy, right? We all know like the sixties. Like there's different decades that are just gonna be heavier than other decades. We're in heavier times than a lot of us grew up with. And you really start to value. Like I was just thinking about like watching a video that's crazy that you made and how much value that actually brings to someone no different than us maybe spitting something very thoughtful. Or like literally, genuinely, just cause I grew up in such food and wine environments. I really do think about these moments in my career. I remember one thing that I just, when hearth first opened. I remember I had a meeting and it got canceled. And I'm never by myself. Like meeting, I'm always having meetings with my family. Like I travel, but this was before I was really traveling like that. And I had like a really good meal at the bar. So good. By myself. And when I tell you that meal, and those four different wines I tried, and like the meal, and like, I mean, this is a random meal that happened in 2000. Yeah, but I can still pull out a meal from hearth like 10 years ago that changed my life. That is an excellent restaurant. And like the impact, like to your point, like the impact, like that restaurateur, that execution, like even like, even that place specifically leading me on my journey to loving bone broth, right? Like, you know, I think about these things and I think that I'm just happy that the world is so complex that all of us, somebody right now could leave a comment on this Twitch stream that could bring like a micro value to the other people on the Twitch. I just think that we, there's a lot of ways to have a positive impact. And now humans with scaled social media and the internet can do it for each other. We focus so much on the bad, there's so much good going on every minute. I don't know. I think it's like 99% good. I agree. With a fixation on the 1% bad. I completely agree. Why do we do that though? Because it's rubber-necking. It's how humans are built. You drive on the highway every day, there's no accident, you just drive normal. There's an accident. Why do you need to look? It's humanity. It's why reality TV does well. It's why social media was so easy for me to understand day one. I'm like, oh shit, this is reality TV at scale. Like, and when I was talking about Twitter on stages in 2007, I would go to Q and A and every time in the first two years of me saying Twitter's next, Twitter's gonna be big, you need to be on Twitter, every time Q and A opened, somebody would be like, Gary, let me get this straight. You're telling me like you're gonna, what is it, a tweet? You're gonna tweet out that you're walking the dog? Who gives a shit that you're walking the dog? And I would always stun the crowd every time by saying everyone. And it would take the air out of the room every time. And it was like the most go-to back to Richard Pryor. I had my shit down. I was like, I know someone's gonna ask, I can't wait to time it. And I'm gonna be like, everyone. And everybody, what? Cause I mean, this is 17 years. It was a long time ago. And people were like, people didn't believe me actually. And then, but what I knew is that people are just interested in other people. Everyone's, there's lots of yentas in the world, right? And two, we take a look at the things that aren't the normal. We don't appreciate when shit works, airports. Do you know how upset I get when people lose their fucking mind on the poor people working at the fucking desk at an airport? It's fucking terrible. Like you were flying a massive machine in the air. You require that wifi works on. Like it is like a remarkable human feat. It didn't exist like 125 years. Brand new. It's a new invention. It's insane. It changed the whole world. It globalized the world. And like it's late by an hour, you know, because they don't want you to fucking die. It is late for an hour for one reason. They would prefer that you do not die. Relax. It's raining and we're gonna wait an extra 50 minutes or there's a part and the lights on and we're not gonna fly. So you motherfucker, don't die and you're yelling at me. I get that it's grandma's 85th birthday. You should have left yesterday. Right. Give yourself some more time. Fuck man. Literally, I travel a lot like yelling like this is such a book. I'm like the plane's being made. Sometimes I get a little bit Superman like I'm jumping like the plane's being maintenance. Do you want to go on the plane and die? Do you actually jump in the light? Yeah, I get weird. I do it less now cause I don't want them to be like, Gary be like this. No, I still do it. Like I, it's not flying because they don't want you to die. Like hurts my heart though. When I see people who get so affected and disrupted because it's, I'm not sure about you guys, but like piggybacking off of patients. It's never about the thing. It's always about how you were raised and what you saw and how you react. And it's like such a learned skill. That you have to like, I used to see my mother get so angry about things. She's like, I don't care and I'm gonna get what I want. And like half the time she'd beat people into the ground and she'd get it. And so you see that and you're like, well, that's a tactic. Yeah, but what you didn't know was what happened on the back. You're like, this feels horrible. There was also another thing. You didn't know what was happening on the back end. It's very nice that you got this little micro win. You won the battle, you lost the war. Oh my God. You end up being 87 and you have two and a half friends. No, because. That are fucked up with you. The internalization of the stress and the anxiety that that woman had because of it. But it's also inherited her mother's trauma. Like the whole thing. You have to learn that. You have to learn to teach yourself. I love you for saying what you just said. At Vekon last year, I had a line that said, just I was just kind of changing subjects. I was like, oh, by the way, fuck your grandparents. And everyone was like, very good. 10,000 people looking at me like, what? And I was like, let me just go on this for a minute because I'm in the mood. Everyone that's mad at their parents, their parents did that to them. I got very fortunate. My grandma was an interesting character. I knew her mom. I knew my great grandma pretty well. Because in Russia, in the USSR where I was born, everybody had babies at 20. So it was like 20, 46. So I knew my great grandma well. I was in high school when my great grandma passed away. You had to have conversations with your great grandma. I would have a lot of, but my great grandma, back to where you're painting a picture and this is the picture I'm trying to paint the audience, my great grandmother and my grandmother were incredibly negative. And even though my dad has a lot of that, he's just a better version. And I have a lot of admiration for my, but if I had never met those two, I would have had a lot more resentment towards my dad. But by able, because I can tell you right now, fuck your grandparents, but if you never met them and you know your dad or your mom is like really fucking you up with their negativity, but you never met grandma Joe, right? Like then you don't really know. I really, yes, I had a lot of conversations with my great grandma on you. You know what the conversations were? Her shitting on everyone in the family. That was 99.9% of our conversations. That's crazy. Which that 97.3% of the conversation with my grandma were that and 95% of my dad's conversations with me early on were that. And then I watched my dad transform. I watched a lot because of our time together and because he wanted to break the pattern a little bit. Breaking our generational curses is so important. And it's something we're not speaking about being intentional that like I realized that within like the past few years, right? Like going to family dinners or things of that nature and seeing kind of these patterns. I'm like, not this cannot continue. It can't. You know, like- It'll break you. And being like intentional about breaking those things. Like the conversations I'm having, especially about my niece, my nephew, and like certain things I'm doing, certain moves that I'm making nowadays, to dismantle that and kind of start fresh a little bit. Create some new positive patterns. You know what's funny about the Nigel? Breaking the generational thing. The hypocrisy drives me crazy. Back to like accountability. Like watching grownups. Like, complete, like, you know, I'm 48 now. I grew up with a lot of people. Like, you know people, like you live life. Like just watching friends who like shit on their parents for doing things. And now they're 100% doing the same thing. Hypocrisy. And then just like, at one point, this is actually a good question. At what point, I'd love to see someone say, at what point can you finally be in a place where like it's time to no longer just blame your parents for everything and act like an adult and put in the work? Like, we're so fortunate. We live in 2024. We know about meditation. We know about therapy. Like we've de-stigmatized. I get it. In the 80s, you went to therapy. You went to a psych. You're crazy. You're like, I get it. That was hard. The good thing about, listen, the world's got plenty of strengths and weaknesses. One great new strength of the last 30 years is we've de-stigmatized a fucking ton of shit. So now you're 39. And my question to you, Ron, is you're 39 fucking years old. I can't have dinner with you for the 1700 time where you're like, and the reason I'm a loser is because my dad's a piece of shit. You're 39. Like you're capable. Step up and break it. I think JK Rowling had a line where she said at some point that there's an expiration date on how long you can blame your parents for your life. What was her number? That's a great question. I don't know what her number was. What is actually for fun? None of us know. We're just now shooting the shit. What's the number? Of? What's the number that we're deciding, the four of us, we're gonna make a new rule for life right here on the spot? I never want to be an adult. So forever, there is no number? Forever, I think that like just because I'm adult then means I'm good, right? And I'm better at what I wasn't when I wasn't an adult because I've now learned and processed. I think like that's the part that I sit with where I'm like, what is the thing that makes me feel like I'm doing something that's adult? And people look at me all the time, I think, and I send a bit of a mixed message because I'm 36 years old. Shout out to 36. There we go, 87. And I feel, it's soon to be 37. Oh, so yeah. Yeah, it's coming. I feel like I'm 18 years old and I can behave however I want. And then I wake up some days and I'm just like, your body can't handle these things anymore or like, you know, you can't behave this way. Give us some very detailed example of things that your body can't handle anymore. Give us a recent Friday or Saturday night. Give us some real, real detail. Names would be preferable. I'm like, you can't do this. It's not, like I could, but I could also just say like last night I went out for dinner. I went to a cool restaurant that I've never been to before. I was with eight incredible people all of my age, maybe a little bit older. We were all sharing dinner and drinks. I had two martinis and I had to be up because I set this expectation for myself at seven o'clock to go do Pilates because I have to exercise now to feel good every day. And it was really difficult to get up and I went to bed at 10.30. So it's like, it's not even that I did so much. It's just like, it compounds. Like there's never gonna be enough sleep for me again to make up for the sleep that I didn't have. It's just like, now I have to treat myself better. I have to take care of myself more in a way that I didn't at some point. And I'm sad that I have to do that, but I'm also loving this journey of like feeling like a healthy, more... Right, so there's a little party that wishes you could still be in a place where you could go to sleep at 2.30, wake up at seven, everything was good, but you're also proud of yourself that you've achieved this place of two small drinks and a meal at 10.30. And I love that. Big crazy night. Ironically, since COVID, I've been pushing emphatically for six, seven, or eight, or nine hours of sleep. And I've been insane, like a run that is like remarkable all time. And I've always been good, like I always got mad when people were like Gary Vee, you're always pushing like work hard. I was like, you're not hearing my message. I'm like, like it so much that you always wanna work it. And then if you got there, then you're working hard and you're gonna love it. But I always slept, even in the height of like when they're young Gary Vee, I was sleeping. Ironically, last night was the first time that I only had four hours of sleep in 100,000 years. Because I'm still on West Coast time from a recent trip because I was there for a long period of time and I'm like still trying to calibrate. And I decided that I wanted to play 6 AM basketball today. And so I had to wake up at five. And so it was like, it was, I can't believe we're talking about that literally last night. All right, I want you to open up a pack of Vee friends. This is my Pokemon meets Marvel world Vee friends. This is my second pack for the day. So earlier, earlier, I got one of these. Oh, you pulled some, you pulled the collector? So it's in my pocket. All right, here's the game we're doing on the podcast. Look at the cards, tell me which card you most resonate with. Which card? You, yep, look at it. Which card, which character do you most resonate with? I'll put it down. Yep, just your key. Yep, you can put the others. By the way, save all these cards because I'm gonna work very hard over the next 30 years and they're gonna be worth lots and lots of money one day. And you're gonna look back at this video and be like, I can't believe I threw that out. It would have been such a good collectible. Okay, here we go. I like all of these. Ariel. Oh, I should. Ladies first, yes, show it and tell us why. Which character? The versatile Viking. There we go. This is a very good card, very big score 73 out of 75. Very good for the game. Great. Why versatile Viking? You feel very versatile, you associate with that? Um, yeah, I'm a very flexible and constantly pivoting human being. Love that, that is. I didn't even read the name of it. I actually just looked at this character and I went, I feel like this. Oh, so you didn't even look, no, you went visual. Yeah, I like that. Absolutely. I didn't feel like you're attracted to the first time. No, I feel like this person. Got it. I'm like, here we go. Let's go. Nice. I'm doing one more. I'm like, show me the good. Did you go visual or did you go with the name? I went visual for sure. Oh man, both visual, you went visual too or you looked at the names? No, I didn't look at the names. I didn't look at the names until after you said it. I went with Juicy Jaguar. Juicy Jaguar. Yeah. You find yourself juicy. I like the mystery. That's what I like. It's like, what's going on here? I'll tell you what I did with those characters. I created mystery. If you don't put pupils in the eyes, I think that you get mystery. It's definitely giving you mystery. The black cat, as you can see on the, the, is the logo of our entire world. So that's the very, very, very, very lucky black cat. I have real feelings that black cats are bad luck. I grew up thinking the same thing. They cross my path across the street. I have like some very deep rooted, the world is not doing the right thing by that. I have something or other. Well, we have the superstitions that my family, I have none. My pick, back to overcorrecting, my family is so deeply Eastern European super, everything's a superstition in my house. I can't go to like an old relatives house without 87 things that happened. You have to. That are guaranteed. Oh, you're tripped on the rug. That means Uncle John's gonna fucking die. I'm like, God damn it. It's like, so now I'm completing. I don't believe in shit. There's 13 fucking black cat. None of it. None of it. Zero. Goose egg. What do you got? Well, it's working for you. Thank you. Dynamic dinosaur. Right, we gotta shoot it. All right, there we go. Dynamic dinosaur. So, you know, now that I'm looking at it a little bit more, it kind of reminds me of Yoshi, if you remember. Of course. Yeah, growing up. So, and that was always a lovable character. So I like the image, but the dynamic element, I think, is what really spoke to me. Life is so full and you don't have to choose one thing. You can do many things. 100%. Allow your energy to flow through and all the different things that you're doing. I love it. I went with like a sponge. This sponge character. It's really funny, like when I do things like this, I'm talking all the time. Obviously when I'm on stage, I talk, talk to God. A stunning percentage of my life is listening. I watch like crazy. I grew up in a liquor store where my dad's first words were, watch the employees, they're gonna steal. So I was like, I'm fucking, I'm like 14. I'm a fucking child. I'm like, I'm scared. I'm like, this guy's gonna steal the vodka. What did you just do with his hands? Like, I was the oldest brother of two and mom's like, I would babysit at 30. Like, the 80s, people did everything young. Like it's not this very pillowcase world. Like everything was like, I was babysitting my brother and sister for like four hours when I was like 14, 13. Like my mom went to the store like, yeah, to do that shit. So I've been always like watching and then I do listening for a living. I watch the culture, like I watch everything. I watch how the platforms work, society. And so like a sponge, I like paying attention and like absorbing. There we go. Final words. I'm so happy to be here. We're happy to have you. This was really great. I have one word, love. Yeah, good, great word. I think a lot about that. It's not that some people are lucky. It's that some people are looking. Just keep your eyes open. I like that too. Yeah, you know, it's so funny. I'll just pick you back off that. Probably like I have a lot. I love saying Xanax Dots analogies. It's how I communicate. Somebody either asked me something that was close to this and then I started asking myself that. Yeah, somebody asked me a question that was similar to this. It wasn't this. And then that triggered me after the podcast, like that evening laying and thinking about this. I thought to myself like, if I had like one last like eight billion people watching me on live stream it's like my last day, like what saying captures it all for me? That like could really be valuable to people. It's very similar to that. It's in life you find what you're looking for. And there because of it, it's a good sum up of what we've been talking a lot about here. Because of what's on the inside, you're either looking for problems, you're looking for negativity, you're looking for the dark or you're looking for the light. And like I really believe in life you find what you're looking for. And I like really ask everyone who's listening, take a step back and figure out what you need to do to not look for the negative in people, to not look for the problem. It's why I want people to stop consuming the news. The news has figured out the model. Social media is, I laugh when people talk about it. News is pumping fucking negativity at scale. Do you watch the news in backgrounds? They're like three alarm fire. They're like, can you report like John was nice to Steve at the CVS today? Can you report that shit? Because I don't give a fuck. Like it's insane, everything's fucking car this, murder that, and it's because people rubber neck. They want ratings. Get the fuck off that truck. And by the way, the news you can't control what they program. Social media, your feed is you. Let me just say it real quick. You wanted the most accountable moment of the show? Your feed is you. I get Jets news, wine shit, happy go luck. I'm happy as fuck when I open my app. If you've got nothing but negativity, you're negative. The algorithm is blank. It is paying attention to what you're gonna pay attention to. The algorithm is you. You are the algorithm. So if you're opening your app and you're like, I feel bad and this is all negative, it's you. Fix it. You're capable. See you next time. Yo. New book is coming.
