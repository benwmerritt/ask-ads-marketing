There's only a couple ways to run a business. You either sell ahead of it that allows you to stay alive, you raise money, or you have a side job, and you fucking do it on the side. I mean, like, there's nothing else. And then how do you get those people to, how do you hire people when you haven't got resources to do that? You don't, you do it yourself. Or you find a co-founder if you can't code the app. I'm starting to program myself, but I know that's not a good way to go down to do everything. Then I would go to meetup.com or read London Tech Blog. Are you in Saudi Arabia and you came here, or you are here now? Got it. So go to meetup.com or other London tech apps, find a developer, there's a fucking developer right here somewhere, and see if you like them. I'm a spreadsheet of developers. I'll send you the video. All right. That's right. Seriously. Like that's, dude, honestly, life is about fucking taking it. Like, here you are, you fucking waited three, four hours, you asked this question, dude right here is a good fucking dude. I've waited three years. Waited three fucking years in the desert? And I've been on construction site. Yeah. It wasn't my problem. There was a customer over there, and he didn't want to come down. He couldn't come. Everybody else in the company didn't want to go down. I drove 600 miles to do their closed the deal, got the check, came back. Knowing that I wasn't going to get a bonus from it, but I still wanted to put my name in the company. I get it. Until now, those same people are calling me now, if we want to get bring it. I'm telling you, sorry, I'm not in the company. Take that man's fucking list. Right now, get his fucking info. Come and get it. I'll work, I'll grind. I don't know the direction. I get it, man. And by the way, there's a million people that are willing to outwork anybody and don't have the talent of strategy, and you don't win. Like that's fucking real. Like there's this notion that like, the problem is that people don't realize it takes multiple, it's not just hustle. It's not just talent. It's not just serendipity. It's not just timing. It's not just leadership. It's not just emotional intelligence. It's fucking all of it. Right, or, or, you might be a number two. And you need somebody who's got that and you're to fucking grind on the engine behind the body of the nice sports car, you know? But you're the engine. Do you understand? Like it's about that. Are you fucking crazy? Like I literally have 20 Facebook top, 100 employee best friends, who fucking have $100 million in cash in their bank. Like I love everybody who thinks they need to be an entrepreneur to make that kind of money. Like, then the 400th employee at Facebook is gonna make more money than 99% of the people standing out here that want it so bad. Yes, there's nothing wrong with that. If that's what you want. Now if you want the high of being the guy or the girl, well then go do that. But you just might make 80,000 a year. But you got your high, like, or you might just want to pair it. And you want to mold your kid. Like, people just, what I don't, I want people to think for themselves. You know? I want people to think for themselves. When I hear somebody that's that hungry and willing to grind and got, right. So then you got to figure out pretty soon that if you have the chops to come up with the ideas or do the things and execute them, and if you don't, you better strap on to somebody who can. Got it? Because there's a lot of people in my organization that are talented as fuck, smart as fuck. But they're not smart enough to see the, my brother, who's a fucking beast, would stand here right now and be like, I told Gary nobody would ever pay more than $5,000 a month for social media. AJ's the smartest fucking dude I know, but I was right. And he wasn't. Because I see shit. Like, maybe you don't. Like, that's okay. There's a lot of things I wish I did. I wish I was better and stronger, my financial kind of like understanding. Cause if I was smart enough to know that I could have taken people's money and took 20% of the action and invested in Facebook and Twitter in 2007, I'd be a billionaire already. I was right. I just wasn't smart enough cause I didn't go to fucking a single course in finance and economics that made me understand that there was a way to carry people's money. I already knew tons of millionaires. I could have went around and raised $100 million, deployed it against Facebook and Twitter. 20 million of my money against the multiple that I made. I'd have fucking 1.7 billion. Piece of cake. All I didn't know was that you could do that. And that's simple shit that everybody knows. Or not everybody, but a lot of people. So we've all got strength and weaknesses. All right, I need to get the fuck out of here. Who have a nice said hello to? Okay. Thanks for the advice. You got it.
