## Transcript
Are you guys posting a lot of Facebook regular? We've done it in the past. That was the perfect answer. This podcast will explode if you get serious about posting multiple times a day on Facebook. Sure. Organic. Wait a minute. Wait, wait a minute. Are you talking clips, like four to 12 minute clips? Sure. Full link podcast, we're talking about shorts. Yep. So just anything. I'll be honest with you, what happened to our Facebook was that it got completely demonetized and it's been shut down basically for a year and a half because they deemed it as reused content even though it was our original content. Start another page. Oh, we had 200 something, 300,000 followers on it. Who gives a f***? OK. Followers don't matter anymore. I think they matter a little bit. They do. You're right. But not as much as they did. And it is way on its way to being to a place where it's completely not going to matter. We are fully no longer in social media. We are fully in interest media. One of the things I've really admired about you is that you've been able to almost see and predict the future of what's going to be happening when it comes to social media. And I remember you saying in like 2019 or 2018 about TikTok. Yes. And I remember starting to post on TikTok because of what you were saying back in like 2018 or 2019. I think my first TikTok. What are you seeing now as the future landscape for business or for marketing or for getting yourself out there? I know you've mentioned TikTok shop, live shops. I love shop, obsessed with live shopping. If you're listening right now and you sell stuff, you need to go to what not and TikTok shop and start selling ASAP. The QVC of Occasion of Social Media is here in the West. It's been going on in China for 10 years. Do it, do it. The acceleration of organic is also on my mind. I could not speak more to my belief of non overexposure, volume creative for relevance for different consumers. For example, you have Gary Vee on now. Your clip with me and you on your social, if the next post is you with a female entrepreneur in her 80s, that's gonna hit different audiences. Different subjects we're gonna talk about in this podcast. Now, I actually think all the social networks should create two feeds. 100% guaranteed view rates from who you care about. Maybe limiting that. There was a great app that I was an investor in called Path years ago that was made by Dave Moran, a great entrepreneur who was an early Facebook employee. His app was called Path. He basically made an Instagram before Instagram where they came out at the same time. I don't call, but you could only have 145 or 120 or 150. I don't remember, it was based on a law of like how many relationships can a human have. I don't remember the name, but you could only have 150 followers. It was awesome. Right, because you would only follow who you really wanna follow. I think if Facebook implemented on Instagram and Facebook and if TikTok implemented one feed that is 100 people max, but you see every post from them. And the other one fully interest, fully interest that that's the killer app. That's what I would build right now. Another thing that a lot of influencers to answer your question. I think the rise of virtual influencers is gonna be one of the biggest things over the next five years. I think you guys should create humans that promote your shit. Graham and I, I don't think that's possible with two men. No, I understand that part. The old way. I think Graham and you should hire a company and actually make your third host a female who's not a real person, who's involved in your content, promoting your show, selling your product. I think every human is going to be in the IP business. In 2006, seven, I predicted that everybody would be in social media and I got really laughed at because it was like nobody was on it. And everybody thought it was stupid. Like who cares if you're walking the dog? Like Twitter used to get on. Like why would you tweet? Like you're eating pizza. Who gives a, you understand you're young and you were too young for this. Like the concept of sharing your thoughts was like not acceptable. That was relegated for people on TV, in certain programs. This is a new phenomenon. The fact that everybody thinks like I'm out there. I believe every person's in the intellectual property business. I believe that within a decade, many people, millions of people will own virtual people and monetize them the way that Disney monetizes Mickey Mouse. So I've seen some of these with like fake only fans. Correct. Where they've just created an avatar. That's right. And if you look at only fans and the sex industry, always porn only, they're always, and obviously when fans is now broadening out, but like they're always ahead. If you've seen that, you probably also know that a year ago, those girls predominantly looked really fake. I'm gonna say something to you right now. You have consumed the piece of content on Instagram that is an AI person and your eyes and brain do not know. 100%. Yeah. Already. Now you're still consuming a lot in there that is clearly fake, a lot better than it looked a year ago. And in three years, not one human's gonna know the f*** ever. I believe it. I saw on Twitter, there's a whole thread about this guy making $10,000 a month in profit from an AI character that he made that he's posting on Instagram and doing brand deals. That's right. With this whole character. That's right. That's that scale already and hasn't even started. On the topic of AI, what are your top three most insane AI predictions? That your grandkids will marry an AI human. What's your conviction level on that? 100%. That they're gonna marry an AI. That your grandchild is going to marry an AI human. So this is what we've been talking about. I think people are gonna have relationships, fully AI boyfriend, girlfriend. I think it's gonna be indistinguishable. You mean Megan Fox, right? The thing like from that movie you saw that? No. The Netflix, the AI robot. I tell you what, she or her or whatever it is? No, not that one. There was a Megan Fox one that just came out. Nonetheless, don't all the same. I believe a robot that is fully AI will marry a human and vice versa for real in your lifetime at scale. And when you say an AI, does that mean like a physical body of a robot? So you're saying that the bodies will get so good that it will look like you and like I could. I don't know if you know this, but people have sex with sex dolls. What Jack does? That explains what that thing is in your closet, Jack. Me? What? No. And obviously like that is like super taboo and it's 2025. And I'm not educated on it though. I don't judge anyone who does, but my intuition is that in 20 years, because the AI can power the robot and because of where we're going and what's going on, that that's fully. See, I've said the same thing because certain AIs, people are getting really attached to them. Just like typing back and forth. What the fuck do you think putting in a robot? Online dating is, that's the same. You know that, right? But I'm like, no, no, no. People fall in love on text. Like people on Tinder or Raya, after three hours of texting back and forth, fall in love. Then the physical part happens. So what is this gonna do to society if we're all just with little robots? The same thing that society looks like right now to a caveman. If we dug up a caveman. But do you think this is just population collapse? No. That people are not gonna reproduce? Maybe. But probably not fully. Cause everyone thinks in order. Just cause I'm a robot doesn't mean I'm not willing to fuck a human. So you think that it would be non-exclusive? But if it's indistinguishable. You think it would be non-exclusive relationships. What? You think it would be non-exclusive relationships. Actually, what's funny, I've thought about this. I actually think AI robots may save marriages. Like I've been thinking about that a lot. Which is like, does a couple introduce, just like real couples introduce swinging in another partner now, is it even better to introduce an AI robot that may help whatever sexual or emotional things are going on in that relationship to become an offsetting contributor to a marriage? One could argue, this was gonna be my second one, that AI will be the reason marriage increases longevity and decreases divorce. I would almost argue that it would be the reason why people just wouldn't get married. Because you would just have to say AI. But it might be both. Both can exist in that scenario. I feel like the word of the day is and, and not or. Sure. I would tell you that as people continue to dissect everybody, I have a feeling people will, I'm starting to learn, I figured out, and I'm sure people that will, for whatever weird reason, interested in dissecting me, yes, and versus or is foundationally to why I'm happy and successful. Foundational, I actually can't see the word. I can't see the world in any other way. It's always and. Everything to me is maybe, yes and no are both vulnerabilities, you know that, right? All right, I mean, things are gonna be absolutes. Yes and no are vulnerabilities. So if you start with something with an immediate yes or immediate no, there's vulnerabilities. I hate no, because it's defense and cynicism. I kind of weirdly love yes, because it's optimism, but a lot of times it's delusional. Maybe it's a great place to start everything. I just think this is gonna lead to complete population collapse, that people are gonna be more isolated than ever, because they'll have an AI person that they could constantly be around that's gonna be perfect for them. What if we're the most isolated now and AI actually starts the decrease of isolation, because you fully feel emotionally all the way there? Sure, but I think in terms of population collapse, I think the government's gonna have to come in and really incentivize people to. But you say that because it's already happened. Well, I think they have to offer bonuses for people to have children. You're too smart, you already know that's true. That's already happened. That's what Korea's offering right now. But to an extreme here in the United States. What if we protected from everything else? Of course, that's what's gonna happen. Governments are gonna be fighting for people. Do you understand what's about to happen? Governments are gonna be paying. I'm gonna get offered ungodly amounts of money to live somewhere else. You know that, right? Governments are fighting with each other for talent. So what if you could build a human being though, when we have AI that's better? Well, I don't know if it'll be better. It'll be different. It's again, an and state. Like I don't know if it's gonna be better. But like a human will, like our brains are pretty intense, bro. You know that, right? Like our brains are legit. Like we're gonna do other. Like when the tractor was invented, everyone's like, what are people gonna do? We all work on farms. We figured it out. You don't think this would be demotivating for people who could just plug into something, zone out or be with an AI avatar or whatever and just be perfectly content sitting in the room all day. I think most people are doing that now in a different point. But to an extreme, but even more people. Like if someone's having an average life going to a nine to five, but they could stay home and just be with this avatar, plug into this system that keeps them perfect. Let's just play it out. In a happy way, yeah. Why is that bad? I'm like, I haven't thought it through. I'm actually just like framing up the banter. I would say that a large portion of society would be isolated in that regard. And you'll have a few select people who don't wanna go in that direction. Yeah, I think you're looking at a way too surface level. Let's bring it up. Sure. Isolated. If you're not feeling isolated, this was the argument of online dating. You're basically just doing a more mature argument of online dating and why online dating was creepy and weird and not gonna work. Yeah, the counter to that though is that you do have such a high percentage of people now with like 30, not leaving their parents, not meeting people, not doing anything. Sure. What the? Bro, my argument, you're actually countering your argument. You know that, right? How so? AI's not here that we're talking about. But we're going in that direction. And when it's here, now it's like even more. No, no, no. I'm arguing that this might solve the problem we're in right now. Graham, I think, is trying to say that it might exacerbate it. He might be right. Yeah, I don't think it's to solve a problem. I think it's just gonna make it worse. I think you're a pessimist. Okay. And? And maybe practical. And maybe being, and maybe cautious. And maybe not delusional. Let me say this though. Yeah. Humans are the most underestimated, underrated, brand and entity in the world. Let me give you an example. Let's say this interesting conversation was in 1950 when we were talking about the atomic bomb. Just invented, just dropped, and now we know Russia has one too. I have a funny feeling if I sat here and said, it will not be used for the next 70 years that you would have taken the counter. Humans are underestimated, bro. That's what everyone who's listening, I'm telling you right now. Humans are underestimated. This AI is big. These last 10 minutes was super fun and like fun banter. We're all trying to think it through. I would say underestimating the human is a mistake. And I would say that for all the people like, what are you talking about Gary Vee? It's now, I would say that you don't understand history. It is not now. You believe it now, because all of you have gotten sucked into listening to dumb. I think I'm incredibly driven by gratitude. It is not lost on me that a day that I wake up where no one that I care about has died or became terminally ill is a good day. I'm very half glass full. I really thrive on optimism and gratitude. So I'm in a good mood. And when you're in a good mood, you get more done. Like if you're dwelling, you're not as productive. You're not as excited. If you're not happy, like when I'm concerned or challenged, my energy is not as high. So you think more people practice that. They would have more energy throughout the day to get more done. 100%. And not even like from a business, I love my business life, but I'm just talking about like life. Like more done as in like, and just like it's better. How do you consciously and actively practice gratitude? Is it like a journal or is it every morning you go through? It's a conversation with myself. Pretty consistent. I think I'm so deep on this. Like I don't need a journal. I don't need a nap. I don't need a guru. I don't need a podcast to listen to to get me there. I think I've been on it for so long. In fact, it's a little weird. You catch me at a good time. I've become very introspective. I'm gonna go pretty deep with you on this one. Both my parents lost the parent very early on. My mom lost her mom at five. My dad lost his dad at 15. Recently I've realized how big of a currency and a backdrop that was to my own childhood. I was pretty petrified to lose one of my parents. Like for real. Like you guys are young enough that like you probably can remember your childhood pretty solidly. Like I do not believe you or Mike who's my dude here in the background. I don't think the three of you or the millions that are listening over the next decade. I don't think most people thought about their parents dying suddenly, multiple times a week in their youth. I did. So I think kind of my curse of that became my gift. By the time I got to 18, I was so grateful that it didn't happen. It's almost like I've been playing with house money since. This has been a really new revelation for me that I've been thinking through. So I think that I think as I got older and even as a kid, I just knew that I had talent. As a kid, I knew I was talented. I knew I could make people like me. I knew people naturally like me. So I didn't even have to try to make them like me. Even if I did, I knew that I cared about people. I knew I was good at stuff like hand-eye coordination. I always focused on positives. Like I was good at hand-eye coordination but I wasn't big and strong. But I was like, I'm great at hand-eye coordination. Not crying about not being big and strong, but being like I have better hand-eye coordination. Like I always focused on the positive. I was ingrained in me. I was parented that way. I think my mom has a huge impact on who I am. I give her pretty much all the flowers. It's why it's easy for me to talk about myself. I don't think on the record, I don't think I, every time you're like Gary Beard, the best. I'm like Tamara and Sasha are the best. They're the best. They made me. I'm the product. V-Friends, when I build it, I'll take those accolades. I built it. But me? It's, so, yeah, I think I, it's so deep, bro. I think like whatever the monks and the Buddhists and like the deepest on anything, you know, like athletes, like how do you move like that? They've been doing it their whole, I've been grateful my whole life. It's interesting that it's the gratitude. One thing that's really admirable about you is your ability to be so productive and work so hard. I'm curious for those that wanna be successful, what's something that they should be willing to sacrifice that they don't? Sacrifice. You know, the cliche answers, people think the answers go into like time with your friends and family. It's real. But that's not kind of like what naturally I felt when you said that. I think, I'm gonna say something interesting. I think if you're in your perfect pocket, you're not sacrificing. I actually think you're being selfish. I think what people need to do is find their selfish place. What about for people though who want a balance in addition to, let's say financial success? It depends on what financial success is and what the balance is. This is like why these are important combos. Like real talk. What's financial success? Do you write this minute, what do you personally believe financial success is to the average man and woman? How much do they make in a year? I would say for the average person, probably gotta be about 250 grand a year and that would be enough to... What do you think yours is? Or are you right now at this point in your life? At this point? Gosh, I think it's an ever-lasting treadmill. Of course it is. That's why I'm asking you the question. For you personally, write this minute, what is financial success in a year? A dollar amount? Yes, right now. At this point in your, like right this second. Graham doesn't wanna say this because if you feel like he'll get screwed. By the way, before, by the way, that's fair. And I want everybody here to, whatever you say, it's not too big or too small. This is where we need to give grace to each other, all of us. It's just your subjective feelings at this moment. Sure. There's nothing, if he says 14 million, what's gonna happen in the comments? Like he's a piece of shit because like the average American... Detached from reality. That's not fair to him. That's where he's at right now. By the way, let me give you all the preview. He will go up and down even though he has the capacity to make more. Things change. I'm just asking you in this moment. Eventually, I'd be awesome, 10 million. Great. So to me, here's the question. Next, what do you think the work-life balance is on for you balance on 10 million a year? It would probably be a constant 24 hour a day, seven day a week thought, struggle for me to just focus on one thing and do that nonstop. Do you want to do that? No. Okay, that's it. Like this, when you start breaking down these questions, like when you say 10, to me, the next question is like, why not 15? It just seems like an even round number. I appreciate it. I think that's right. The other question becomes like, what is balance? Like you're married? Yes. Are you? No. Right. Let's just go there. That worked out super well for me. It's just different. You remember not being married? Yeah. Easier to put more into work? Sure. Real. Then child, then parent sick, then parent not sick, then burnt out after a while of something and just like, it's not as fun as it was for six years. Like when I did Wine Library TV every day for five days a week, I loved it all the way until I didn't like it at all. You guys like this right now? Love it. Love it. I'll tell you, there's going to be a day where you don't, for real, that's okay. Sure. That's just human. So, to answer your question, brother, like, how does one balance it by being the judge and jury of themselves? Like, who's standard of work-life balance am I supposed to achieve to? Or you? Or you? Whose definition of financial success am I supposed to? What is it? Is it your 250K for the average or is it the American average of 60, 70, 80K? 250K makes a lot of sense in San Francisco and New York and LA. 250K in rural middle of nowhere, Tennessee, you're drilling there. What does your current work-life balance look like? My normal Monday to Friday is 8.30 to 10 p.m. That's my normal. Now, there's times when my son has basketball practice and 7.30, I'll go into that world where Nick's in the playoffs right now, I'll go to a Nick's game. But my normal right now is probably nine to nine, somewhere in the range of 12 hours a day. And when was the last time you felt burnt out and how did you overcome that? I define subjectively burnt out as sustained unhappiness doing the thing. And my definition of sustained is probably 100 days in a row. I've not had that. Here are my moments of change. In my late 20s, early 30s, I had spent working 150 hours a week building a huge business for my father and was getting paid nothing. In my late from 22 to 28, six years straight, 365 days a year. In my late 20s, I started to feel anxiety that I was in a bad spot because I had no money and I was built a huge business and I had nothing to show for it. I was just getting married at the time and I was like, oh my God, I'm poor. I was making 50,000 a year. So, and not that 50,000 is poor, but 50,000 when you actually work 150 hours a week is real bad. You know, it's different if you're working 40 hours, at least you're getting the bowling team and the weekends and your kids, right? You can wage your hourly income. Exactly. So, I was in a real tough spot. That went from like 28 to like 30 to a really interesting time for me and my dad. We had a lot of friction. I was reconciling my feelings. He was reconciling his. And it finally hit an inflection point where I was like, I gotta leave this business and start my own thing. And my brother was graduating college. I started this spanner media. So, I would say the last time I really felt burnt out, macro was the last years of Wine Library because I felt like the trade wasn't fair. And I don't blame my dad actually, it's immigrant business. He's like, you're gonna inherit it. It's gonna be yours. So, it was like all those immigrants, you know. The other time I felt burnt out was with Wine Library TV. The last 50 episodes, I was like, I'm done with this. I've done this. It's five days a week, five years, I'm done. DailyVee put me on the map in a lot of ways for a lot of people. That's what I remember. Even now, when the guys wanna film me, I'm so used to not being filmed. It feels weird, whereas for the first year after DailyVee, it felt weird to not be filmed. There's that. So, projects feel burnt out, but I don't feel burnt out. I don't feel soulless or sad. It sounds like though you feel burnt out when you've accomplished everything that you've set out for. Yeah, and I'll be honest with you, I really don't view it as burnt out. I view it as ready to move on. I think words have gotten weird. I think a lot of people weaponize the word anxiety when they're inconvenienced. I think we've created words like imposter syndrome to make the word insecure. Itch. Itch. So it's really genuinely not associated with burnout. I think there's been moments where I was done, to your point. Burnout to me seems like an, I define burnout as emotionally struggling. I like how you break down what a word actually means. It reminds me of like Jordan Peterson, or reminds me of like Alex Formosi. You know who that is, I did him on the podcast recently. He said that he doesn't like to use words like burnout because he prefers to use words in observable reality. And that's what you did. You broke down burnout to be like, I consider it as sustained, displeasure with something for a hundred days. I think words, I think that's interesting and say, I think words have been weaponized, words have been. It's too ambiguous, it's subjective. But if you break it down into something that's observable, then it actually is relatable. Speaking of words, a popular one lately is quiet quitting. Do you feel like this is a way for people to support a healthy boundary? Or is it something that people use as an excuse for just not working hard? Yeah, both. Or just like cheating the system. Like people will cheat the system if they can, if they don't respect or like the system. Like I don't worry about people, Vayner that way, because I think we like them too much and do the right things. And I know people do, but it's not a sustained issue for us. But I think another company that doesn't give a about their employees have it at scale because what you put in is what you get out. So do you think it's a problem with the employer in those situations, not the employee? I do. I'm gonna say it again. We have 2000 plus employees here at VaynerX. There are definitely dozens and dozens that are doing all sorts of that I would not be happy about because we no longer work in a five day, like you can like write. Yeah. But I'm not crippled by it because it's inconceivable that it's at scale because we're too productive as an organization. And I just know what we do for our employees, which is we're not Mother Teresa, but we like, we have humanity. I think if corporations had more humanity, they would win. What's a way that you would recommend they incentivize their employees to work harder? By reverse engineering them individually. Some employees want more money. Sure. Some people want a new title. Some people want more work-life balance. Some people want to work in a different department. We're in constant I, and I don't like saying I, but I'm gonna say it because I dictate this from the top. I, more than even my direct reports and their direct reports. And now as I keep putting more pressure on this, we do a pretty darn good job of being open for business for the other person. Because the more we make it awesome, the more they'll stay, the more retention I have, the faster I think we can go. I think business is like sports, I think speed matters. And how do you do that at scale with so many employees? Effort, effort. Like it's just something I give a shit about. And for people, you know, like, it's like, you know, you'll find this so interesting. It's an interesting, the reason I'm double clicking is I want to bring value to the audience. And I felt I left it kind of high, but I'll tell you why I left it high and why I'm gonna go low now. If you care about something, you will do it. The end, like the actual answer to your question is effort. Sure. Underneath that, allocating time in my schedule for one-on-ones, using the people that have been here for a decade and deploying them on places I can't get to that I know needs humans. You know what I mean? Like it takes up my mind time. This may actually, actually, this is really cool. You'll find this interesting because of what you guys do. And I have a sense of how you're paying attention. Both of you know, I've been less GaryVee'd out the last 12 to 18 months in the personal brand game. There's other people that have popped like, I've been operating. This is actually me now deciding I'm going back into effort of GaryVee. So I guarantee people will feel me around more and know more of me and feel like GaryVee's everywhere more in 26 than in 24 and 25. Because in 24 and 25, I operated VaynerX and VFriends. Effort. What do you think about potential overexposure? Does that ever bother you in terms? It's not achievable. You don't think it's possible. Who's overexposed? I think it depends. I think if you have a story and you go on 30 podcasts, generally speaking, each performance of, you know, each unique podcast will start to dwindle because the story gets redundant. People have heard it enough times. You're looking at it from the wrong angle. You're in the game of knowing what the is going on right now. To you, they'll become redundant. Right. But to the guest on the show, it's still new eyeballs. The overlaps are there. And by the way, here's how it's going to play out. Okay. By the way, back to me. I'm going to be out and about. Okay. GaryVee's showing up on all the same. Let me hear. I haven't heard, ironically, some people like, I haven't heard, probably talking about the same. But let me say, oh, some, then they go and listen to the second week later, I'm on something else. They're like, let me listen again. Oh, pretty similar to what he just did with coffee. You know, like, and then the third time I show up in the results of like the new podcast, they're like, I'm not going to listen. They're not, I'm not getting overexposed. They've gotten their fulfillment. But every one of these shows has different audiences. Not to mention, and this will resonate for you guys, because you had a journey of consuming my content. We also like the greatest hits from our favorite artists. Like Elton John and the Rolling Stones and Billy Joel are still playing the same. But there is something to be said about people or bands or brands who only make an appearance every now and then. And it's such a big, special occasion, like my chemical romance taken 20 years off and coming back once and that's like a big hit event. Why are we so addicted to ore? What about and? You're right. Yeah. And people don't get overexposed that have consistent awareness and Bill Brandt. Listen, I've been one of the most prolific public figures in social media, which is the medium of dominance today. An ungodly amount of people know me. I'm stunned every time I'm outside. A much bigger group does not. It's interesting from our perspective, because I've started posting less, but the less I post now, the more views each video gets. Of course, because it's sitting there longer. Correct? But it's also a bit more special when it's like once a week or once every other week. You're choosing ideology. I actually disagree with that. I think that you're net awareness is down. You've increased your barrier to post a video. Like it needs to be a more pressing event. It needs to be a bigger deal. And so for that, it probably raises the average. But by the way, you're loud. And by the way, you may want less people to know, but be impacted deeper. But by sure, but people like Gary, get more views. I'm like, no. Like, but what are your gross views for the month? Sure. So by the way, everyone's allowed. You're allowed to be Marlon Brando and you're allowed to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, like, you know, like or whoever's. And that was the 80s of like being in every movie. Or like, Kevin Hart. Yeah, you're allowed to be Kevin Hart and you're allowed to be, you know, a once in a blue moon. They're both they both work. My answer is and. And I want everyone to hear this right now. They're like, oh, yeah, I'm more that I'm more like you, not like Gary. But then. But what about you're allowed to be both versions? By the way, I'm just living through me being less content out there. Even though my less is like quite a bit. By the way, I may wake up in a year and get into the concept of one post a month and do that for a year and then be like, that was awesome. And be like that. I'm back to volume at scale. This the restrictions we put on ourselves is fascinating to me. So like for me, when I hear them, like, that's awesome. Like, enjoy this chapter and you'll make decisions if like this works for you. It doesn't. And you're also allowed to change your strategy. Now, for people who are on that entrepreneurial journey, how do you know? Or how do you dictate when to push through something versus when to quit and try something different? Only God knows the amount of people that quit a week before it was all going to turn is actually quite high in the scheme of the last 100 years. The amount of people that right now continue to do something that is based in nothing but delusion is even higher. My answer to this question is, do you like it? Sure. And how long can you hold your breath? Those are my two questions to you. If this, if we were three brothers and we're just jamming on this for real, not a podcast, I'd be like, do you like it? How long can you hold your breath? Sure. That's it. That's the answer to that question. It's interesting. So for this podcast, obviously, for any guests we have on the show, we do copious amounts of research. And so I feel like I've listened to you for, I don't even know how many tens of hours I've been on. I don't even know how many tens of hours in the past, a couple of weeks easily. But I'm curious because you seem different now than in the previous things I've seen you on. Like you seem way more introspective, way more subjective. Like you've been more meta. Like, do you know why? Why? Because your guys energy is that. I'm chameleon. I feel like you've been on some pretty relaxed podcast though. Like you did one recently with a veteran that I saw that I felt was pretty laid back. Yeah. I mean, you know, I would say that what I'm feeling right now while I'm doing this is I really respect your audience and I'm pushing myself to bring as much value as I can, which is what I do in every setting. Intuitively in a relaxed podcast, sometimes I think energy is the highest value. I'm going on my intuition on what I think could bring the most value. And I think, and I also to your point, I think life is like day to day as well. Like I'm also fresh. I don't know what podcast you're talking about and like when they came out, when they were filmed. But because I haven't been put on so many podcasts so often for so long lately, I do feel a little fresh. And when I'm fresh, it takes me down new paths too. That's interesting. I think when it comes to social media too, I think people really value authenticity. Yeah. Do you feel like now authenticity is almost becoming like a strategy where people are really like overemphasizing authenticity? I have good news. Like you can go back to interviews I did in 2007 on YouTube and that was the buzzword of 2007 social. I think authenticity has always worked. I think people try to force it all the time, which is the complete opposite of it. And I think there's the way to really judge authenticity is longevity. I think the people that try to fake authenticity do not have very long plays. How much is there out there that you choose publicly not to talk about? Because you're pretty open about quite a few things. And how do you dictate what you are public about versus what you're not? My private life is something I don't talk about. I always thought that I was too important because I kind of had a sense early on that I was going to it was going to work. I just knew. You know when you know, I just knew. So I was like, let me be thoughtful about this. Let me be thoughtful about this. Like if I get like actually this is like 2006. I'm like, if I get actually famous, what is the worry about that? It's like, oh, privacy is valuable. Plus actually, you know what? That might not even be fully authentic. I am inherently private, which is wild. But like, yeah, I mean, I think talking about your passions or ideas or business, that feels like public domain. But like my children or my relationships or I don't know, like, you know, so I talk about my parents a lot because it's a framework to like stuff, but it's not like I'm telling you like what's going on in their lives or like, I'm not in reality TV mode. So that was conscious things like politics or religion or things that are a little spicier. I don't talk about them because it's because I don't love to contribute from a place of opinion. I like to come from a place of observation. So if I talk about politics, my observation is that the opposite sides of every issue, weaponized fear to get people into a frenzy. And that's it. That's my observation. It's like uncomfortably boring. Do you recommend other influencers keep certain parts of their lives private as well? I think people have to reverse engineer their truth. You know, like I don't I don't have real hunger for fame. If someone has intrinsic deep value and hunger for fame, giving the world your personal life is one of the clear paths. I don't really want to deploy my judgment on someone else's journey. Sure. So no, I don't I recommend people being self aware. What are some of the things I recommend people being self aware? And I recommend I just said this earlier and I saw you picking up on this. I also recommend people having the ability to change their mind. Like right now, if you're listening right now, I'll be like, yeah, man, I am whoring out my children too much and I'm starting to see the negatives of that. Like my four year old daughter was like stopped in a park by somebody the other day because I'm doing that. Well, you're allowed to change. People struggle with change. Like that like this a lot of the genre of this convo right now, I want people to have the strength to change their mind. Because that really is liberating to allow you to do a lot of what do you think holds people back from change? Is it fear? Of course, of judgment from other human beings. Insecurity is the poison that navigates our world. What are you insecure about? Am I you that was insecure about girls rejecting me? Did you get rejected or something? No, back to not doing like I didn't ask out a lot of girls in high school and college that I wanted to because I was fearful of the rejection. In a world where like I was like pretty charismatic and had my game together in a way like, like, you know, as you get older, especially because I became public figure, the amount of like when I first started happening, the amount of girls that reach out to me like, why didn't you ask me out? And like, and like I could be grounded in the fact that I don't think they were saying that now because this was even happening like not the Gary, but you know, now, like even when the wine thing happened, which meant nothing to nobody, it was just like reconnecting. So that was a part of my life that I that was very clear and fear. I feared most basic adolescence things. I feared to ride a bike. I didn't want to skin my knee. I feared swimming. I didn't want to drown. I feared those two things very heavily. But by compared, like I was a late bloomer in a lot of ways that way. But what are you insecure about now? Not much. Um, what am I insecure about now? Deep like like, and this will probably go into territory of things that I want to share. But like, let me say it this way, I'll say it in a way that I feel comfortable because I want to answer it and not not answer it. The number one thing I probably fear now is I want to be as good of a father as I possibly can. And so that's very top of my list. Like, am I achieving that? And I'm scared about things that I haven't been able to get to the place where I wanted to. What do you think it hold you back from that? Um, being able to the thing that I've always struggled with historically, it's a wild one. My greatest weakness, my kryptonite in a world where I was luck of the draw gifted with a ton of circumstances and a lot of other things and then put in a lot of work and feel very comfortable in that was I'm not candorous with people I love. Like my lack of candor, it blows people away. Like that doesn't make sense. I'll explain. I don't give a what you do think of me. I do not care what anyone who's listening cares. I care very deeply. I care more of what Mike thinks about me than you guys and anybody listening. And he's a young employee in my life and I care more about what Kailin who's worked here for 13 years feels than Mike. But you start getting into my children and my parents. The more I love you, the more I care about how you feel. And I was raised by a mother who was not candorous, who had such gift of gab and charisma and personality too that she could just get to the result without making conflict. Got it? I also was raised by a father who was ridiculous with conflict and looked for conflict at every point. So I had two very opposite parents and I was formed in a way where I viewed candor as creating fear for someone because I've always had leverage. For most of my life, I have been the financial and emotional leader of my life, meaning me and everybody around me. So when you have leverage and you're deploying candor, there's a lot that comes with that. When you're telling an employee that, bro, you're not good at your job. My brain goes into Mike walks out of here and starts to go to LinkedIn, starts to cry, starts to go do drugs, I'm going to lose my job. I just created fear. I had to have a very tough chapter in my life about five to seven years ago when I realized this was my kryptonite. And what I was actually doing was creating fear because people would have to get fired when you're running a company. And what people started to understand was they didn't know where they stood with me. And that became the ultimate fear, very humbling moment in my mid 40s. And how did you navigate that? And how do you break into just being open and honest with people without creating fear? All of our vulnerabilities are things we can't see. I'm really fortunate with self-awareness and paying attention, but I couldn't see the candor thing. Once it became obvious to me, both with my employees and some of my personal relationships, I was like, oh, and I'm talking like looking myself in a mirror, brushing my teeth and looking at my eyes and being like, dude, my inner dialogue is really cool. Like me and me are good. You know, I really just went there. I was like, dude, you suck at this, man. Like, and this is going to ruin your life. Was there a specific moment that was like a big accompaniment? Yeah, it was a combination, you know, not to go too far, but it was a combination of things going on at work, which I'm comfortable with, which was, I love my employees super heavy. Yeah. There was just enough employees. And I knew why they were mad at me. And I knew why they were mad at me that we're running around the world being like, all I care about is anyone who knows me to think I'm a decent man. Having employees that were running around the world being like Gary V was like, this is wrong. The only ones that were saying Gary V were people that were consistently underperforming, but I didn't have the ability to over communicate it and then would pull the rug from underneath them. It was black and white on my subjective opinion. Maybe they were performing and I was wrong, but that's, you know, that's the judge and the jury when you own a business, right? Yeah. I was like, that sucks. I got to fix that. And then things in my personal life, which I'm less comfortable with sharing, but ultimately, I was like, look, I've got to fix this. And it's hard, bro. Like you're in pretty good shape. I don't know if you've always been or not. I'm in better shape than I've been historically. Like, it's work. Yeah. Like I was in Toronto for a board meeting last night. I landed last night at midnight. I was in the gym at 6am this morning. In the gym, I landed at midnight. You have to put in the work to be able to be better. And so I had to, and I continue to practice candor right now. And I'm still a five out of 10, but that jump from one to five has closed a lot of wounds and vulnerabilities. Who do you go to for advice? The truth is no one, which is a great gift and a great weakness. What I do when I'm in a place of thought is go into more of a cocoon. I'm actually talking and advising and jamming. Like we were like, if we like knew each other, we'd have dinner. We'd have these kinds of dinners different because we're a podcast, but it would be this. Yeah. I'm always thinking and philosophizing and strategizing and vulnerable and like I'm living and I'm taking it like it's almost like advice is happening all the time. But when it's in the moment that you're asking where I'm like really thinking through something, I weirdly do the reverse. I think most people don't advise every day. And then when they have a problem, go for advice. I'm the reverse. I'm like constantly like advising, but then when something's really important, I go into cocoon and I'm in my own and I think it through. How do people improve self-awareness? It seems like, like you were saying the ability to be dynamic and change your opinion, change your mind, change your beliefs is one of the best ways that you can improve your overall life. I think so. That is self-awareness is required for that. I think therapy is good. I think going to therapy and having another human being who's professionally trained try to throw some things at you really is good. I think what I've done is I think human, I think there's a very big relationship between humility and self-awareness. So I have a very big thesis that humans are not trickable. And then I have another thesis that humans are the most trickable. So maybe break it down. My belief is that 99% of people are uncomfortably trickable and that's how the world works. What do you mean? I think most people are so insecure, so short-term, so selfish that if you just feed them what they need, that you can basically manipulate them into anything you want to do. It's what politics does. It's what businesses do. It's like what life is. I hate that. What I like is trying to win with the 1% that are the reverse. And those people are completely the reverse. They're completely not trickable. And I think when you understand that, what I just said, or if you believe it, and whether my percentages are right, maybe it's 80, 20, but the concept that the masses are in this one place and then there's a different group of people that you actually want to be friends with, that you actually want to know, that it's the actual thing. That if you think that, you'll constantly be in a place of humility and self-analyzation and you're humble, you're listening. And I think there's something there in a real way to what you're asking. I think surrounding yourself with the right type of people has the potential to create a lot of self-awareness. And what would be the main qualities of someone who is trickable versus non-trickable? Like, is it an intelligence thing? I believe it's a security thing. I think it's confidence versus insecurity. I've come to, I turned 50 in November, fun number. How old are you guys? 26. I'm 35. Yeah. Like, even at, you're a straight baby, but even at 35, right? At 35, back to my life, you think about 10 million. I think this will be very exciting for you. And I hope it's very exciting, more importantly, to the audience. At 34, I beat $67,000 for the year. Yeah. That's why I believe it. That's why you hear so much Gary V. about, be patient. What'd you make at 35? 35 was when I started doing this and I just signed a book deal. So I got 100K for Crush It. I mean, like probably 240. Do you think that you needed to have the actual accolades to play off of that confidence? Or did the confidence exist from the beginning to the end? Beginning to the end. DNA, parenting, circumstance. You never questioned your actual confidence. You never questioned your aptitude. You never questioned your... In business, no. Like I said earlier, what's a child's childhood? Does the opposite sex like you? That was a third of my whole life. So I had plenty in security there. Sports, right? I was good early on because I have crazy hand-eye coordination. I got worse as we got into middle school because speed, height, power, strength mattered. So that was off. School, big one, right? Kids' self-esteem in school, right? Good grades, smart. Bad grades, dumb. Especially if you're almost 50. You grew up in a different world. I'm 25 years ahead of you that way, 24, 3 years ahead of you. Like teachers told me I was an idiot. That I was going to be a loser. Like these are grown-ups telling you to do your face. You're going to be a loser. So I had plenty of things that could be in securities. I just had the most important things right. One, I had a mother who parented me in a way that made me believe in myself. But she didn't do what modern parents are doing, which is create a delusion. She said, you're a good dude. You're good at, you've got strengths. But when I had shortcomings, I had ramifications. I had consequences. How do you try to instill those same qualities in your children? By doing that, by telling them the truth. By cheering for things that are good, like are they nice people? Are they not entitled? But I can't do one of the most important parts. Environment. I did grow up in lower middle class neighborhoods in Jersey. They are growing up very wealthy. How do you think that's going to change their perspective or the fear that they can't live up to what you've accomplished? That part I feel good about because I create almost no, they may have their own version, but one of the great mistakes a parent that is successful makes is ask their child to live up to their, I do not have, the problem is there's too many people that are successful that are actually insecure. So then they ask their children to do things because they care what other people think about their children's accomplishments. On the record, on this podcast, I do not give a f*** about what people think about what my children do for a living. So my children will have the luxury of not having a father that wants them to do what? Live up to my legacy? Me. I'm their dad. I just want them to be happy the way I'm happy. And whether they're entrepreneurs like me and what makes them happy is to build Mazel tov. If they f*** what makes them happy is to give away all the money I made because that somehow makes them feel better for being rich kids and that's what they see the world as, as long as they're happy. Not that it's some sort of poisonous f***ing thing. Like I just am very focused on do they enjoy their life? Are they productive? But like environment so it can't be fake. How close is happiness linked to being productive? Because we had Grant Cardone on about a year ago and with his daughter in the room, he said he doesn't want her to be happy. He wants her to be productive and if she's productive by default, she's going to be happy. Yeah. Look, I think every parent is allowed to see the world how they want. I'm also a buyer of productivity, but productive is defined by different metrics. What is productive? Is productive making a million dollars a year? Ten? Hundred? Is productivity knowing that you were born into luxury and thus you give your life's work to give back to humanity? And everything in between? I don't know. But yes, I do not think waking up in the morning and having nothing to do leads to anything but bad. Right. But what one defines as productive, I think is different for every human. For example, I have a lot of ways to maximize for a lot more wealth than I have. That's just not where I'm at. I feel like I'm being more productive by leaving good deposits by spending a lot of time on Gary V. And now V-Friends, my Pokemon Sesame Street thing feels like I'm going to be able to do both. I can be selfish and selfless. I can build one of the biggest intellectual properties of all time, which is very, very valuable. But I also can get these characters so popular that I can start getting to kids younger and instill in good virtues into them. What's more productive? Yeah. My income statement this year or the impact I made on alpha dudes not being complete dick faces, what's more productive? How much money I made or the fact that I've gained muscle mass and that injury I got in my dad's liquor store with my left glute. Now that I've been able to actually get my mind muscle right and I'm fixing it and I have better life quality, which who decides productivity? Yeah. If you make $43 million a year, but your human behaviors of alcohol and eating and gluttony and all this stuff leads to you dying two years later. Were you productive in the 43rd year? Were you made all that money? Because you're not productive at 45 because you're dead. So I think the definition of, but I agree with the macro thesis. I do believe in productivity. I think who gets to define productivity? My answer is you get to define it and then you get to change your mind. If you want to go from 20 to 30 and eat Doritos all day and build an empire, good. And then 30 to 40 is pure love and enjoying those, not yourself out, but don't do it for someone else and don't do it for the cheering. Because if you're doing it for the cheering, when they're booing, you're dead. What do you think are the main things that are holding people back right now? And if they could make these adaptations, they'd be able to unlock their full potential. You seem like a very... Oh, I have a very good thought on this. Sure. Number one, two, three, four and five is the utter lack of accountability. What's going on right now, brother has nothing to do with anything other than we've been over coddled for 30 years. The end. You can do anything once you decide it's your fault. If you think it's your mommy and daddy's fault, that's what takes up the oxygen. You just spend all your time telling everybody about your mommy and daddy. If you think it's Trump or Biden or Putin or China, that's what you spend your time talking about. Everybody has become remarkable at pointing fingers. It has become a global pandemic. Why is that? Over over coddling, lack of accountability. And where do you think that started? Overcorrection to a lot of parents that got underloved and overcorrected too far and we lost our way. So you think the pendulum is swinging back to accountability? No, that is my great hope. Okay. I know I do not feel like we're there right now, unfortunately. I feel like we're still in the very heavy midst of, I mean, we have find so many things to blame on. Do you know that nobody, do you know that I didn't even know I was in Gen X my whole life? We didn't talk about generations. Do you have any hours? Gen Z talks about boomers. It's become a meme now, though. It's, we're just so. Is that creating just cages for ourselves? Yes. Thinking that we have to subscribe to a certain thing? Of course. But most of all, the ultimate cage is when you think somebody else is in control of your life, your f***ing death. But you know what, but people get rewarded for that online. And I feel like that's a slippery slope because when people post about themselves being a victim, they get so much support and so much sympathy online. It feels good to post something. Oh, you've, yes, ish. You've lived through these last three years. The pendulum is swinging. They also get a ton of hate. I feel like it's, it's not balanced though in terms of the hate to life. I feel like it's getting balanced. I feel like you're right three, four years ago, but I think it's changing. I think it depends on the person in their audience. Of course. Like mostly, like if you have like a girl that's crying like on a camera and her audience is like 95% women, like all of the comments. But if it's a guy that's opening up about something. I get it, but let's talk about this. That goes back to the point of how we got here. That girl didn't wake up at 23 looking for unlimited sympathy. She's yearning for how she was parented. She wants to be coddled. That guy wants to be coddled. We want to blame his fault, your fault, that fault, this fault, that generation's fault, that politicians fault, that government's fault, California, New York, Trump, Biden, Florida, Texas, her, like everybody wants, like, where's this? But real quick, where's this? When somebody's upset today, where is I suck? And that's not the same as I suck. Let's go into depression. I'm talking about I'm accountable and capable. I don't like America. I can move to Costa Rica. I don't like my boss. I can quit. Oh, but Gary, I have a mortgage. Get out of it. Like we, you can do, you know that, right? But that's also purposely and consciously subscribing to mild delusion. Because there are certain things that happen to certain people that is not, that is not their fault. Is it important? By the way, people, somebody just died of a stroke. It's not his fault. So it's important to delineate what I'm trying to get at between fault and responsibility. No, no. I don't care about the semantics. To your point, fair. But let's go to where I'm trying to go, which is, okay, something happened to you. You don't have a lot of money saved up. A rock bounced on the highway and smattered your windshield. And now you have to fix it. That, what, you know, I guess you could say I should have left my house earlier or later and the rock wouldn't be there. It's not the, that's not the ridiculousness I'm looking forward to it. I'm asking like, what do you do about it now? Like you, everything is about what you do about it. Could that person go on Craigslist and pick up on the free listings and sell it at the flea market this Saturday and make 320 bucks? They could. They could. They don't have to. Could that person ring the doorbell of his neighbor and say, hey, you're, you always talked about my garden being awesome. Your garden, I'd like to do your garden for the next four months, but I want 300 bucks for it because my windshield just broke. Would you like to do that deal? They could. Like, like happens all the time. How you react to all that life is, all life is happening all the time. There is nothing else. The only thing that happens in life is happening all the time. What I'm interested in is what do you do about it? Is your life perfect? I think I have a pretty good life. Guess what? Bad news. Something's going to happen. That's life. You're not going to be the one that goes through life without pain or struggle or micro issues. When you answer like that, here's where I go. That's awesome. That made my heart smile. Now what I want to say to you from you, my younger brother is, bro, do not complain one day if that's your truth. Not one complain out of your mouth because in the macro, so good. You're one of the few people on earth that gets to say that to be mentally prepared and let's start thinking about that for when it doesn't because a lot of people that are only accustomed to it being good or get addicted to it being good. When they get caught with bad, don't have the backbone to take the punch in the face. And that's when the starts to get bad. Those are the things I like to start thinking about. So if you could say one thing that would make the biggest splash, the people listening right now, that think that they don't have control over their own life or that they have found themselves disagreeing or subconsciously they're disagreeing, they just don't consciously know it. What could you say to make the biggest splash, the biggest impact to wake them up? There's so many different places I go. One, a part of me goes into a really deep, tough love place of like, cool, you. I don't give a s***. Look what the f*** do you want from me? Like I'm desperately trying to tell you in life, you find what you're looking for. And if you're looking for good, it's good. And if you're looking for bad, it's bad. And what do you want from me? Humans sitting over here like, I don't need to convince you, you want to have a s*** life, you have a s*** life. There's that part. Then there's the compassionate part, which is like, bro, please, like you have one life. The math around having a life is 400 trillion to one. You have one already. You actually won. No matter how s*** alcoholic, abusive father, sexual abuse, like, like, where do you want to go? Third world country, like, where do you want to go? You still can actually, like, you still have a shot. You could have not been born. Like you have a shot. Like you have a shot. You know, the sports fan, how many times do you want to watch a game? Look at what the p*** pacers did to the bucks the other day. The game was over, but it wasn't like you could suck in life. You can be 53 right now and be a f***ing loser and dominate from 60 to 80. Enjoy it. You could. Like it's never over. Like, I don't know. There's a lot of versions to your question. I don't know which one's going to work for someone. That's why I use them all. I've got nothing but compassion to hard. Like I'm trying. I'm throwing out. Why do you think I make so much content? I'm desperate out here to make everybody understand. Please for the love of God, because deep down, what do you want from all of us? I don't judge you, but I can't change you either. Yeah, that was, that felt good. I've never said that. That's me. I don't judge you. I really don't because I know people have different circumstances, luck of the draw, all that stuff, but I can't change you. You have to change you. You're way more impressive than I. And I'm not just saying that. Oh my gosh. I'm not just saying that. And I don't say that usually, like almost ever on the podcast, but I had high expectations. And first of all, this entire unit, whatever you call this, floors and crows. Oh my gosh. But also you're way like sharper and just maybe it's because you took that break, but I don't know. I don't think so. I think we talk about this a lot. Like I sandbag it a little bit publicly in hindsight. Like what am I going to say? I'm smart. I'm sharp. Like I'm obsessed with value for the audience. But to your point, like this is nothing. You should like, you live here for a month. You're like, holy, like I'm, I'm, don't forget, I did it and then talked about it and continue to do it. So thank you for that. That means a lot to me. Um, and again, the reason I like dealing with my compliments is again, that just my mom's 70th birthday is this weekend. Like I can't wait to tell her what you just said because it's going to make her happy because I'm her product. Shout out Gary's mom. Yeah. Tomarra V. Okay. So we got some rapid fire questions. What's something you hate that everyone else seems to love? This could be anything. Complaining. Okay. That's a good answer. Dialed answer. If you could have a 30 minute conversation with any entrepreneur from history, who would you pick? That's a great question. Who would I pick? I would pick Walt Disney. You get 10 million tax free today, but you can invest it or use it for business. You just have to spend it on fun. What do you buy? Um, that's a great question. No, no, it's cool. I love that question. 10 million for fun or do I would probably courtside MBA like real like sports is going to be way up there. I do like restaurants. So I'd probably like and wine. So I'd probably go super hardcore on it's less about going to like travel. It'd be travel for purpose around food. So it's a very ridiculous meals. Fun. I mean, I would give away. I would love the feeling of giving away loads of cash at scale in like fun environments. Not like the stuff we see like the influencers do more like I would go to like Peru and give somebody really like $30,000 where that's like 4 trillion. So some of that stuff would be really enjoyable with the cash. What's one guilty pleasure you have that would surprise people? That would surprise most of my silly stuff. I've shared a lot guilty pressure. That's a lot of people's pride. When I'm not a very big guilty pleasure person, I kind of a like it's funny my fiancee Mona is such a clean eater. But I think people know that I'm like willing to like eat 13 Snickers bars. If I have to watch him, I call it some obsess with what I got one. But it's not a surprise, which is why I'm probably I'm obsessed with cereal. But weird ones like I'm huge on Captain Crunch. Captain Crunch is the best. Mr. Beast should have a certain crunch is the other favorite cereal I have is grape nuts, which is completely different. Never heard of that. Yeah, look, I'll check it out. Would you rather own the New York Jets but never see them win a Super Bowl or see them number two, but never number two and not even close, by the way, chasing the Jets is my great love actually owning them. I'm neutral about winning a Super Bowl is everything to me winning and not owning. Why do you do this? Because my mom needed me a jersey, a jet's jersey, when we're really poor with the number five on it. When all my friends in the neighborhood had a jersey and I asked for one, but we she we couldn't buy one because we didn't have that kind of money. 25 bucks on a jersey was not in the cards. So at night while we were sleeping, my mom knitted me a jersey. It's the pinned Instagram that I have that if you go my Instagram, it's pinned to the top. Why I want to actually buy the jets has a lot to do with why I want to buy them. And every time I take a photo, I just want to pay an homage to my mom. Cool. Thank you so much for coming on podcast.
