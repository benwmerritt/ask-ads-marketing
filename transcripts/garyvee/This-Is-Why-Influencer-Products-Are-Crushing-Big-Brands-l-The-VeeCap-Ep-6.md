You know, Gatorade feels high-matter to drink in real life. Hershey's really is feeling Mr. Beast's beast of all. Like, Poppy is a problem for Coca-Cola. In a way that when I was yelling about it 10 years ago, they didn't have the belief that it was real enough, so it didn't have to matter as much. You're feeling market-bossed. MUSIC But just deep down, I'm doing things. Hold on, I don't know if we know this. Yes. Is it someone's birthday? Yes, it is. Oh, my gosh. Let's sing it. Happy birthday. Look at this cake. Look at this cake. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Brock. Go Jets, it says. Happy birthday to you. I don't know if I can even take a bite. This is the best cake I've ever taken. It says go Jets on it. If you don't walk the candles, it's 30 years of bad luck. I could walk the candles. WHOO! CHEERING Oh, man, incredible. Thank you, guys. Let's use New York City. It's just in the middle of it right now. In a world where everybody who surrounds this little island no longer comes to it on Friday because work from home is now a real reality, I'm going to guess, no, correct me if I'm wrong, that your Friday nights don't look the same that they did four years ago. Fridays are the one day that have completely changed, especially in cities like New York. You just used to fill up at lunch and stay busy all through the day and to the night and then people would come into town. Now you're quiet all day on Friday and you don't pick up till dinner time and it's very strange, very different. I'm going to tell you, we're building larger front ends, larger environments. I'm contrarian. When everybody's cutting down their kitchen and McDonald's is just a drive-throw and every one of these businesses are being overreactive as a contrarian, I want to provide a space that you want to sit in. Come to any of my places because nobody else is providing it and they're doing better than they've ever done. There's obviously variables on the rest of it. QSR is going to be different than a private club, but for example, it's also margins. If you're in rural parts of the country, the fact that you're now giving a Vig to a DoorDash and an Uber Eats that seven years ago was someone that was just coming for the capital expenditures you put into your building starts to chip away at your margin. There's a lot of pressure on the new behaviors. I think it's interesting. I'm taking a really interesting approach with it. I'm curious to see what will happen. if I really let it organically do its thing, I think the merit of the inside is really strong. I'm really proud of it. But the last version of this, I wrote Jab Jab Jab Ray Hook. I love that. 10 years ago. This is the 301 version of it. Yeah. It's like literally. I still recommend it to people. Yeah, and like honestly because of that, and like this does it again, it goes visual. That's nice. And now we have something called QR codes. I didn't have a decade ago. It has a dark horse chance to really pick up heat. It's now like every day a meaningful fortune by a hundred company. It's not on coming in and saying like we need social. It's like we need social 301, not social 101. Like what does that mean? It is truly, truly my great pleasure to welcome you all to today's special closing bell to celebrate the launch of Gary Vaynerchuk's new book, Day Trading Attention. A prolific builder of audiences, Gary is known across the world as an expert on connecting with people on a human level and at scale. And for that, I think that deserves a big round of applause. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for my incredible fiance, Mona, to the rest of the VaynerX team for being here. I think at the end of the day, there was no place that was more obvious than to launch this book than here. Literally it's called Day Trading and it's about attention. And the foremost brands and innovative brands in the world, I do believe are listed here. And some of the companies you mentioned along with their competitors and their contemporaries are going into the most challenging decade in communication history. Let there be no confusion. This book was not written for ha ha ha and giggles and fun. It's being written because we are entering the most challenging media and marketing landscape that we have seen since the transition of the radio to the television. Social media and modern digital platforms will completely impact the prices of all these incredible companies over the next decade like it has for the last. And I hope you enjoy it. Thank you for being here. I'm honored to be here. It is a little boy's dream to be here. And so I thank you. And I'm excited to be here. And I hope everybody has a great day. Here we go. Yeah! Let's go! Yeah! Six, five, four, three, two, one. Yeah! Yeah! This is the NASDAQ's second close today. It was the record close. It makes sense. They're pulling it together. Right this way, everyone. How about a time splatter? Everyone, come on. Yeah! There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Three, two, one. Two, three. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This is a 22-year beef field right now. Where did you get it? I want to be an entrepreneur. I want to grow up. I want to follow folk references and find answers. So you have any advice for me? Don't read about it. Be about it. You want to be an entrepreneur at 16? Sell some shit on the corner. Be an entrepreneur. I've been selling right now. It's good to have you. Thank you. I love that too a lot. Thank you, brother. Thank you. See all your videos. Thank you. Have the best day. I took a leave four years ago to TikTok and Instagram because of you. I'm a passion, empathy. I'm a teacher. I'm disabled. I'm a helper, empathy. I love kindness. Thank you, brother. Thank you for being inspiring and positive. Thank you, brother. I really appreciate it. That means a lot to me. Thank you. Thank you. Sell. Thank you. Yeah. So you have all the photos from today. I love that. I'm going to put that on my shelf. Let's give it back to my shelf. All right. Amazing. Thank you for your help. Oh, my pleasure. We couldn't have done it without you. Your color. Have you ever rang the bell? Either exchanged? I know not. No. So this was really fun. Yeah, it was really fun. We'll do your shirt. We'll want to know everything you think, but not all the way. We're not done yet. Thank you so much for coming. I'm Sahara Thadadi. The Chief Digital Officer here at Nasdaq. It's a pleasure to be with you all here today. Thank you, Gary, for convening us and giving us a reason to really be here and be in conversation. It's my pleasure to welcome you all to Nasdaq. We try to ask everyone this question, or ideally, not we. If you suspend reality and you had a billion dollars, not to put it down payment for the jets, but to use it to spend to solve some kind of problem, what would it be? I believe that the biggest issue in the world is that humans are predominant. Humans are predominantly insecure, and that leads to envy and jealousy and unhappiness. You know, I just wish people genuinely could love themselves. And so I want to create a vaccine that instills actual self-esteem while it extracts insecurity because I genuinely believe if that happened, then everybody would get this fantasy world that you dream about. Well, the answer to the quiz, my friends, is insecurity. It drives everything. And on the flip side, all the good comes from pure self-esteem. You want your kids to be able to deal with social media? It's not deleting TikTok off the phone. It's building actual self-esteem. The way we talk about social media today is the way that we talked about alcohol in this country in 1925. You can ban it. You can do anything you want. That's not the solution. The solution is understanding how to handle it. We are so incapable of handling judgment from other people that that's what's happening. So that's what I would spend a billion dollars on. I love that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
