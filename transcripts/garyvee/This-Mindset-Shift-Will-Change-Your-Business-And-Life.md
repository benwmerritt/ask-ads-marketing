Where you're about to watch is an epic Q&A at Everville in San Diego. Super excited about the V-Friends, Focus Falcon, partnership with Everville. I love watching entrepreneurial journeys get built and what they're doing over there is pretty rad. Speaking of rad, there's some incredible questions here and I hope all you entrepreneurs, operators and people enjoy this. Don't think of yourself as a coward. Think of yourself as someone who is realizing that the world likes to weaponize fear and you got caught up in it and now you realize you don't want to be in it and now you're choosing practical positivity, practical optimism. Because when you say that you're a coward, you're beating yourself up. Attention is the number one asset. Let's say it, let's say it. Let's say it. Thank you for coming, I'll see you inside. I saw a stream that you were doing on Twitch where you said your brother has like seven friends but you want to love everybody in the room. And I have that problem to the detriment of my business. Sometimes I love people too much. What would you say to me? It's a journey and I think the reality is that, it's just about, it's like working out. The wrong person to talk about. No, no, no, no. Like you know this, it has to be close, same for me. You can just start putting in more effort on the family part. You just can't. You just can't. And by the way, it doesn't have to deduct. From what you're doing with everybody else. It can be in addition to. Keep that in mind. I love you. You stay lovely. Thank you so much. I got some courses in the chat. I love you. How are you guys doing? My brother. You gotta be careful with what you say. Tell me. You say 99% of people won't do the work. Yes. The 1% that they'll turn their barbecue business into a media business. Seven fucking years. Seven more shows. We're launching shows for other brands, working with the top restaurant technology companies. That's all because of fucking the work that you do. And because you're executing. I will be very careful. Keep speaking to the world. Oh, I will. I will. Awesome. Standing here today, I'm the CEO of a 500 unit restaurant brand. There are 15 countries around the world. I listen to you every day. I'm giving you flowers. I don't have any questions for you. I thought all my life, what would I ask? I have nothing to ask, man. I just want to give you flowers. Thank you, my brother. One, two, and three. He started his YouTube channel about a little under a year. He already has 2,000 followers. He does his plushies. He makes them talk to his kids. So I do marketing for different companies. I love it. Southern, I do, I spent a lot of money on how to engage with consumers. How to determine the customers. I get it. He's been following me all the time since he was seven. He's like that. So can you get him? Yeah, so that place, when I used to work for him, I used to work for my older daddy. That's awesome. I've been with him for 20 years. That's awesome. Such a pleasure. Yeah, so I told him, what's up? Get in this photo. It's such a humbling moment. Thank you. All right, y'all. We're going to get a picture together. Two big smiles. Ready? Thank you. All right, thanks for having me. It's unfortunate that positivity is rare. So thank you for seeing that. Yeah, and you know what? You're all auditing your feed to ensure it's positive. Yes. It's such a pleasure. Have you done some editing and feel it? Yeah. That means the world to me. That affirmation, I wish that all 8 billion people understood that. The second you decide, the algorithm's doing nothing. It's reflecting who you are. You're in control of it. All right, thanks, Miles. One, two, three. And what would you say to a guy like me who's about ready to pitch a deal to Eddie this week on the phone? What would you say to me on how to pitch for Eddie? By asking him opening question of what brings him value. That's it. That's it. That's always that. The reason I get so many deals done is everything I start with is, what's in it for you? Yeah. You know? And then I can tell you what I want. But why would you do this and why is it good for you? And is there anything I can help you with? These are the proper questions. No problem. How are you? Doing all right. Good. How's it going? JB. JB, such a pleasure. Yeah. Thank you for coming. What's funny is I used to despise you. OK. I used to watch it up there and swear on stage and everything. I'm like, what the fuck is this guy? He was like, oh, I despise him because I wanted to eat him. You're very humbling. That's very kind of you. It means a lot to me. Honest. Thank you. Yeah. I love everything you're doing. Thank you, brother. Here's a lot of you. Ready? One, two, three. Justin. Justin, how are you? Great to meet you. How are things? I'm great. I'm a 26-year-old professional baseball player. Good for you. I was with the MAP last year in AAA. Well, good for you. I'm a free agent right now. Kind of looking for what's next. Hopefully a new team. I'm growing for some teams soon. Good for you. What do you think would be the best way to leverage the platform that I've got? I feel like it's kind of a make or break. Like, we are here. Me, I'm 27. I get it. Right on the head. Yep. I think it's you making content. I'm putting it out on TikTok and YouTube and using that to get attention to open up other doors for you whether in baseball or outside. Sure. I really believe that. The content is the game. And it's finding a way to do it. I think where players, you know, you're pulling around the ball. That's my biggest fear. Yeah, no, you've got to. You know, you want to take away from what's actually on the field. You're going to appreciate it. Guys. You don't need any of that leverage. You don't need a top five prospect for the MAPs to be in that contact. You just need to make contact. People are interested in that. The journey, the grind. That's like the lessons you've learned, the things you took for granted at 19 that you don't now. Exactly. Notice how you said, oh man. Like that. All right, I got to do this because I'm going to be out of time. All right. I hope entrepreneurs spread their message into other businesses using YouTube. Can you talk about the importance of going all in with your YouTube for business success in 2024? You know, it's so funny that we're even still asking these questions. The fact that this is the question still blows my mind. If you live on earth and you don't understand that YouTube is one of the most significant platforms to build brand and sales, then you're just completely lacking the pulse of where consumer attention is. And whether you're a B2B or a small business or a family business or a huge corporation or a human, it's just missed opportunity. Nothing in life is you have to do this or it won't work. But missing out on things that clearly work is not a good business strategy. That's my answer to everybody. Wow, thank you so much, Gary. You're welcome. Gary, thank you so much. Thank you so much. I'm just telling you my audience is Spanish. Gabriel. Gabriel. For viral one, I would just tell you how much I've learned from you and the fact that you have to stop being a coward. You know, I would just watch you one of your last videos. And I would tell you, like, don't demonize yourself, people, friends. Don't think of yourself as a coward. Think of yourself as someone who is realizing that the world likes to weaponize fear and you got caught up in it. And now you realize that you don't want to be in it. And now you're choosing practical positivity, practical optimism. Because when you say that you're a coward, you're beating yourself up. Thank you. When you're saying that you were caught in the vortex, that it isn't exactly ideal for your day-to-day happiness, you're like, OK, I got caught. But fuck it, I'm going to move over here and I'm going to be out. That's a very different way to have a relationship with yourself. And loving yourself first. And I just have such a big heart that I'm trying to balance being too kind. You know? There's no such thing as too kind. OK. If someone takes advantage of you, that's their mistake, not yours. There is no too kind. OK. Be kind. But don't be afraid to ask for what you want and make sure in your kindness that you're not being manipulative. Make sure you're not being fake kind with some expectation on the other side. Yeah. Because I'm having a hard time giving too much. You know, that's why I said being too kind. I give everything. I know. You're one of the biggest examples that you don't charge for your courses. You don't charge for your courses. You can charge for your courses. But give away a lot and make the course more valuable. I give away a ton of stuff. But VaynerMedia and VaynerX is a $350 million income that people pay for. Absolutely. You can give away a lot in the macro. But in the micro, when you get one on one, it gets very detailed. And you can't do that generically. So you can give and you can ask and provide value when someone takes you up on that ask. Definitely. Definitely. Man, thank you so much for your time. Gary, for this moment, it's dream come true. Thank you. And I didn't even expect it. Man, so I'll give you this one. You got the proper hat, bro. You got the proper hat. What's your name, bro? Sil. Sil. Sil. Yeah, yo. I need you like 10 seconds. Yes. Tell people of black and brown descent why they need to get involved in AI. Because I think they're slacking. Good news, black and brown people. White people are slacking too. Everyone's underestimating AI. Girl, boy. Native American, brown, brown. Girl, Africa, New York, Stockholm. Everybody's underestimating AI. Go do your homework. It's going to be the currency of the universe. Word up. That's it. That's it. Me, yo. From the great bottom of my heart, I'm a teacher. And you're alone. You're taking the shit out of yourself. Remember what it means when you said that you don't have your feelings and who's going to be there. People going to show up? Yeah. I just went Saturday and I see my dog. He's going to the community. Everybody showed up. That's what's up. Thank you, my boy. Thank you. Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Hey, I know you're a best of guru. I just got a separate package that added in 20K that I wasn't going to get before. I got hired. Let me go after five weeks at a new job. My? Yeah. Acquisition. Yeah. So what you're? I've worked at a company for 25 years. So you're trying to think about what to do with that money? Do you have any tips? My biggest thing when you're not a seasoned investor is to vest in stocks of companies that you adore. Whether that's Lululemon or Netflix. Go directly to them. Buy public stock. OK. When you go to a small company, it's high risk. Yeah. That 20 can be gone. Yeah. You put 20 into Amazon, it means 60 in a year. Yeah, that's good to know. So just do it. OK. Awesome. Big smile. OK. I just have a quick question. New real estate agent, what would you recommend for like for the content somebody who's not as experienced? Putting out the information of you learning. Like show them the behind the scenes. Like making content like people think you've got a front and act the part. When in reality the authenticity of the process is what people are looking for. Number two, also I believe very heavily in making content of the neighborhood or the towns where you sell the products. The more you're known in the area, right, more you're showing up at Facebook feeds talking about a new restaurant or the school system or the pothole on Main Street, the more people start to build trust. And trust is what you're looking to build. Right. Absolutely. I'm going to go outside and answer some questions. I'm going to do some Q&A real quick. You guys want to circle around? Sure. This is the manager here. I figured I got some time. Yes. Gary, so I create content in Spanish and English. Yes. And I like to know for the hashtag, should I keep it just one language or can I mix because when I speak I'm bilingual and I mix up languages. The hashtag is completely irrelevant. It's not going to have any impact on the content. Right now the way social works is the content itself, the copy is important, but the hashtag discovery, it's just not the way we all search in TikTok and in Instagram. We don't really do hashtag clicking occasionally, but it's so small. It's going to be irrelevant. And by the way, you could in that scenario, you could do both. You can make like, there's no limit on hashtags. So I think you need to focus and for all of you, whether you're building a personal brand or something for your business, the focus needs to be on the first second of your content, the thumbnail, the headline, the hook, the copy. A lot of you post the same video on Instagram and Facebook or Instagram and X or TikTok and Instagram, but by just changing the copy, knowing that the audiences are different on LinkedIn than they are on TikTok, you would get so much more traction. Focus on the content, but the biggest mistake I see from all of you is you don't focus on the first second. And that's all you've got. Got it? That first second really fucking matters. And so get much more religious about that as at least the starting point. Yeah, Gary, what advice would you have for someone who's posting on YouTube but they're not getting any views or subscribers? It's really a ying and yang to that. One is be humble and self-aware. And if you've been doing it for 18 to 24 months and really have dozens, if not hundreds of videos and you're not having traction, it's time to swallow the pill of you're not providing content that people like. On the flip side, way too many people quit too early and only make six or nine or 30 and like fuck I suck. I made hundreds of videos before it started to happen. And so, you know, I think it's a balance between perseverance and patience and also being humble and self-aware of what you're doing. But the biggest thing I would say is if you've already made 20 videos and it's not happening, pay attention if all the videos are basically the same. The biggest mistake that most people make is they don't change it up. They don't change it up. And I think changing up the format, how you do it, again, I think the game of content making is finding something that's sustainable and works for you. So like if you're not comfortable in front of a camera, that's a problem. But what if you actually talked behind the camera and your hands were the visual? Maybe it's just your fingers typing. Like maybe you put a camera on your head and you're cooking from that perspective. That just eliminated the excruciating about the tell me of I don't want to be on camera. And I promise you today, I haven't seen it. I can't recall it. But today there are plenty of people with huge audiences that we don't see their face. You could also blur it. You could also be a character from the NFT. There's a lot of things you can do. There's a lot you can do. And so I'm just a big fan of not falling in love with excuses. And I believe that the world has fallen in love with excuses. And blame. If you blame your parents for anything, you've already lost. It doesn't mean that they didn't fuck up. But just remember, they got fucked up by their parents. So before you love your Nana more than your mom, remember she fucked her up. I mean it. I mean it. I mean it. Blame is a very, complaining and blaming has become very popular. And that's why people are upset. It is a complete excuse riddled framework that will always lead to unhappiness. It doesn't mean it's not true. It doesn't mean your dad wasn't an alcoholic. It doesn't mean that the, you know, that your boss didn't fuck you up. It doesn't mean that's not true. It just means that if you sit and dwell on it, you're finished. Dwelling is a forever guaranteed loss. Quick question on mindset. It was such an abundance of opportunity in the world. Yeah. You personally have a struggle with allocation of time. Yes. Of course. How do you reconcile that? By realizing nobody's ever done it well. Let me explain. People think they've done it well. But you can show me anyone's life and they're like, I did this well by time managing. And I could say, but you missed this. This is back to relationship with losing. The only reason I'm able to do so many things. A lot of you know, you didn't come here if you didn't know me or what I do. I do a lot of things. I've got 33 balls in the air. My ability to be comfortable with 16 of them dropping is why I'm me. Most people are just so scared playing with their one ball and they don't want it to drop because they're worried about the booze and when you drop a ball. So with time management, you do your best. You learn. You're probably more thoughtful about it today than you were five years ago. You wouldn't ask the question. It means it's on your mind. I think about it all the time and then I do every day things that I shouldn't be doing on paper, but I can't help it. I want to. And so it's the inability to judge myself when I don't execute to the max of my time management that allows me to time manage well. I think a lot of people live in a scarcity paradigm as well. Correct. They can't shift. They can't make that. I agree. I think it's why people are so negative towards each other. They think other people are taking their shit. I have good news. Nobody's taking your shit. The only thing that's taking your shit is you thinking someone's taking their shit. That's the key. Have you heard of human design? Of course. What are you? No clue. I'm aware of it. Like I'm aware of most things because that's what I try to do. But I'm very like weird in that what I do works for me so well. Back to time management. Back to human design. Like it's just like I know what works for me. Just an incredible comfort zone with myself about me and making decisions that I think at the moment work for me and for the people around me. So I'm a DNF student for a reason but you may know what I am. So big question. There's 30% of the world that's human design projectors and they're not here to work. They're here to see and guide. What would you say to all the human design projectors of the world? To make sure in that mission that they're not overly selfish. I see a lot of people who try to claim or position themselves that way. But in reality it's very easy for me to see that they're just positioning themselves for something they are selfish for. So that 30% that claims it, my intuition is 80% of them are full of shit. And I mean it. It's a very important reason I'm jumping on this. I think when you know it's inconceivable for a human being to not be selfish. Now I know what it feels like to give as the selfish energy. I see it in younger relatives in my family. My nephew is me. I see him. It's selfish for him to be good to his sister and his friends. That's what gets him off. I get it. But I think people need to be very careful with themselves on being comfortable to and vulnerable enough to say there's things they need to. I worry about people that if there's you know back to this you know when I hear that I worry about resentment. I worry about people claim you know live that life and then wake up and they resent everyone and listen I'm someone who's been able to go down that path so I'm speaking from a place of knowledge. You wake up and you start to resent people and you have to go through this process with yourself understanding nobody asked you. And so when you're a giver you have to be very careful because you wake up one day and you've got feelings and all of a sudden you have to really come to that harsh reality of knowing nobody asked you. Or more importantly even if they did ask you it was your ability to say yes or no not them asking and so these are important deep questions for those people. Alright we got to go to the airport. I'm sorry I got to catch a flight. I love you guys. Stay well.
