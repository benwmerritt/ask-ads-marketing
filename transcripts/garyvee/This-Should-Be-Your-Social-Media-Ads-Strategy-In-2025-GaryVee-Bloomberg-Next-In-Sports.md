The views achieved by organic social media today is the single most important variable when it comes to marketing. Because what's happened, as you may know, is in the last two years, you no longer get the same amount of views based on how many followers you have. You can now get a million views or you can get 20, and that is a big change. And so now, for the first time in the history of marketing, the quality of the post is creating the awareness and the reach, not media dollars amplifying. There is nothing you can do that will impact your bottom line more than getting serious about organic social media. You're obviously really big on social media. Are social media impressions something you also pay attention to? More than any other thing. That is a huge shift. And I would argue the biggest opportunity for Fortune 500 and for middle America's entrepreneurs. So I believe we're sitting right now in the prime of social media platform importance in society to build brand. And I look at it every second of my life. Do you think it's easier or harder for social media strategy or for marketing strategy? One could easily understand why it would be harder because there's more competition, right? But the fact that it's even possible makes it easier. Meaning there was nothing. Small town Jimmy owning a bakery could do something as big as Coca-Cola 25 years back. Even have the money. Small town Johnny can now literally get the video in his bake shop that could get 40 million views and triple his sales the next day. I really need everyone who's listening that has a small business to understand there is nothing you can do that will impact your bottom line more than getting serious about organic social media. There is unlimited examples of a TikTok Instagram post going viral every day, every day that changes the course of a small business's life. I don't think that is known enough to everyone who's listening and everyone that's here and everyone. I just think it's a huge mis-dopplicating. So I would argue it's easier to break out because that 40 million views used to cost $2 million in media and that big shop did not have that money. Yeah. So it's sometimes harder to catch attention but it's cheaper. It's easier to catch attention. Again, play it out, play it out. I understand what you did there but I want to nuance it. In 28 years ago, if you and I were brother and sister and our uncle old bakery and I was still Gary Vee and he's like, Gary Vee, give me advice. It would cost money that he didn't have. So yes, is it easier to get big on TikTok when I was yelling about it seven years ago and trying to get all of you to get on and nobody listened? Yes, it was easier. But today it's harder. You get less views. Instagram is much harder to get views today than it was seven years ago. Yet every day many people get views. You understand? Yeah. But the fact that it's even possible is the punchline. We ought to talk about what the future of TikTok is. Okay. What's gonna happen with it if something does happen to the legislation in the next couple of months, right? Basically what I know, what it seems to me and I'm trying to be in there is it's either gone, which means all that attention will go to Instagram and YouTube shorts and Snapchat's coming out with an app called Simple Snap. So that's gonna be probably a TikTok clone. Vine, I expect, I think it would be crazy for Elon not to relaunch Vine, why wouldn't you? If it gets sold, I'm hearing that the algorithm doesn't come with it. So it would be TikTok in America, but the algo would work differently. And that would mean I don't know. Right. You know, so there's a lot to it. Plus back to the boomer crowd. Live social shopping is another thing all of you need to be paying attention to. The QVC of occasion of social media is on. Yeah. If TikTok shops and live are on fire, there's an app called What Not that's doing very well. I don't expect Zucks to sit on the sideline and let TikTok get all the action. So I expect more from Meta on live shopping. It's a big deal. Super role ads. Yes. You guys have produced a ton of them, two of them this year. Tell me about that. You know, look, I spend most of my time in the advertising industry and I think the Super Bowl commercial continues. Even at $8 million a spot, continues to be the best deal in advertising. So get 120 million Americans to watch a 30 second video. Even VaynerMedia, which is probably at the top of the sphere right now of buying ads on social media, on Facebook, on Meta, on Snap, on TikTok. On our best day, spending $8 million to get 130 million Americans to watch 30 seconds of a video almost impossible. So the ad buy is a remarkable deal. We've done a lot of them through the years. This year we're doing one for 2B and one for DoorCell. And we're really excited about it. And it's just like, it's always an opportunity to really change the course of a business. If you get it right. So what are those strategic meetings like to get it right for the Super Bowl particularly? Because you got to stand out, but you don't want to be a flop. Yes, you definitely don't want to be a flop because then it goes from the best deal to the worst deal. Right? I think the reason VaynerMedia has become a big, big advertiser in the Super Bowl and a lot of brands come to us to do it is because what I do in those meetings is remind everybody we're not here to win the award for funniest commercial. We're here to sell stuff. This is why I want to do Bloomberg. This is one of my favorite things to do at Radio Row because we're talking business. And so it's all fun and games for these ad people, all the Don Draper madmen. They want to make ideas. They want to blow things up. They want to do stuff. I'm like, friends, we are here to sell batteries. Really, I mean it. And so for me, the strategic thing that has been lost by Madison Appy is I think a lot of times they're trying to win the funniest or best commercial and they're forgetting why they're doing the commercial. And so my strategy is can we do something that we can build off of the rest of the year to really make a mark on the sales for the country? Yeah. And what are the metrics you look at that makes it successful after that? Is it a successful commercial? Yeah, for me personally, I'm looking at somewhere in a range of a three to six month window on how sales have been affected. So it's literally how many door sell batteries sell on Amazon and Walmart and Target and Walgreens over the next six to 12 months. Could we see a significant impact compared to all the stuff we're doing day to day? That's it. Yeah. So one other thing we got to talk about is Pickleball. We met a couple weeks ago at MLP tournament. I want to know what do you think the state of Pickleball is on the professional side? Because we know on the commercial side, on the participation side, it's still growing. But what about professional side? On the professional side, the athletes are more compensated than a lot of sports, which we're very proud of. There was a merger of the leagues, the MLP, had a merger PPA and so I'm very excited about that. Now we don't have competing leagues. So I'm in it with the league. Our viewership on MSG Tennis Channel is stunning, even us on how well, small base, but doing way better than we thought. Social media consumption is huge. Attendance was huge last year. I would say that this season coming up is very big. We feel and we need for it to have a good jump up. If it does and all things pointing at will, now you start getting into having leverage for TV rights deals. But the players are thrilled, they're getting paid a lot of money compared to like WMV. I mean, it's crazy how well the... And women's players are getting paid more. We have Anna Lee who's like the best player in the world. So yeah, she's comped nicely compared to, especially when you add endorsement. So I'm very bullish. I'm very bullish, but I'm not... We need to keep building. We've got good momentum. We could easily in four years have lost it. So I think all the owners have their foot on the pedal to make sure it goes. What else needs to happen? Is it more people at tournaments? Is it... I think it's more awareness and social and television. And I think it's what I've always thought about sports. Sports is comic books. When there's a hero, sports are big. When Babe Booth and Mickey Mannell are the biggest heroes in the world, baseball's big. When Larry Bird and Magic Johnson came along, they saved the NBA. And then you had the Jordan effect on top of it. Look what happened in women's basketball. Nobody cared until Caitlyn Clark and Reese came along and you've got superheroes. So I think pickleball will be super. And Emily, I have elephants, me that. And so I think about that. And I got to ask about ownership too in the NFL. Because you always talk about wanting to own tests. So are you still, is it still something you're... Oh yes, it's what I wrote in my fourth grade, like class future dream and nothing has happened that has made me want it less, only want it more. Now, these things have gotten very expensive. The Johnson family doesn't look like it's in any rush to sell. But I can only control trying to build as big of a business and empire as possible to give me a shot. And that's what I'll continue.
