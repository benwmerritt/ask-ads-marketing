The biggest issue that so many people have is they talk about things in theory versus reality. If you just listen to this, this is what I'm doing for everyone here, like what are you gonna do? Like you just- I'm gonna come up with that. You know, which is amazing. Like you're coming from a good place. You'd like this for them, but like, I just also don't think you have an answer to the shortcut. Right. So you have no other choice. I think we should go to the audience now. So we have a few microphones at the front of the room. Do you have a question for Gary? We can ask you to do his lineup behind one of these microphones, and Gary will choose you based on who's in the line. I highly recommend you get your ass in line. Let's get going. My friend. Hi Gary. I'm Will. Four years ago, I stood here in front of you, 2019, and you spoke to the whole room and said, if you're not on TikTok, you're killing yourself. You're killing your business. And that night I went home, made my first video, and an eight year old boy said to me in the comments, never do that shit again. I had shit for one year on TikTok, and a couple of years later, I had half a million followers. I didn't always look like this. So I created a mascot character on TikTok. I listened to everything you said, and during that time, I created a business as well. I knocked every door. Who's there listening to me? I went to the shop to stock my products. I did everything which you asked me to do. Took the nose, took the nose, took the nose. Didn't let me get down. I got there in the end. But then also, I realized that you said to me in that 2019 that people are trying to be three and no. There will be a lot of wrong decisions you'll make, and I did make a lot of wrong decisions because my first product didn't go very well. I re-appointed it. I made the second product, which I am selling since January 2000, this year, 2023. So I just want to know, even though I understand that there's not going to be three and zero, it's always going to be wrong decisions, right decisions. When do you know that you give up? When do you know that it's not working? When does the ambition and ability become confused? When do you know that you go back to what you were good at, which is social media? And the second part of that question is, if you think, well, sorry, the second part is like, how do you position yourself in the market? Well, on the first one, you know by the results. If you go for a long period of time and people are not buying your product, your product is wrong. So this is the thing, the product is selling, but when I am selling it. OK. So I've been to so many investors. I've been on a couple of TV shows as well, which we'll be airing later this year. I can't talk much about it. The investors have told me that the product is not scalable because the product price is quite high. The product quality is good. I, since January 2023, I've sold 10,000 units just doing farmers markets over the weekends. OK. So the product sells when I sell it, when people know what it is. But on its own, it's probably an accessibility issue. Do they repeat buy from you at that point? Yes, absolutely. So haven't you actually won? Yes, but I want to have the mass, the scale. Why? Because that's what my dream is. Why? Because I want to leave a legacy. For who? For my child. OK, but why are you defining that on mass? Probably because that's one of the dreams I always had since being a child, that I want to build a company which everybody should know about. Well, then you should adjust what you're doing. You're talking out of both sides of your mouth. It's clear that it doesn't scale in its current form, right? But you just said you want to go mass, but you're telling me, but it sells when I sell it, but that's inherently not scalable. So which is it? I want to scale. So I want to bring down the costs. Well, this is the thing. I can only bring down the cost by reducing the quality of the product. I understand. But you just told me the number one KPI is scale. Maybe it's nothing. See? See? That's the difference. That's the difference. You know what I mean? Yes. I'm going to move on because we took a lot of time on this. That, what I did for you, is why I did it that way and why I stuck with it. You can't have both if both can't coexist. If he's talking, I want scale. That's the most important thing. That's the legacy. Well, then you can't have a subjective opinion on quality. Is it McDonald's burger quality? The bottom line is the person that's eating it gets to decide. Not me, not you, but they hit scale. Scale is not debatable. Call it scale. It's not a scale. It's not a scale. It's not a scale. It's not a scale. It's not a scale. Scale is not debatable. Quality is debatable. And last thing, in 2019, I wanted to give him a food product. It was not ready, but now it is. I'll thank you, brother. Thank you, man. Hi, Gary. Thanks so much for your generosity on my daily podcast every morning. Thank you. What's your name? The team. I set up a management consulting company after being bullied in corporate. I've been suffering from an anxiety disorder. I've grown into seven figures organically predominantly through LinkedIn. My question is, because I'm in a male dominated industry, and I know you're not a male, but you probably work with successful women, how can I be disruptive so that I can gain the attention of the companies that are constantly bringing in the male consulting companies, you know, typical middle-aged white hair, as opposed to people like me that are female-led entrepreneurs? You've already succeeded, though. You're doing seven figures. Yes, but I feel like I'm sort of still. There's so much more I've got plans to do and want to do, and I'm just kind of like not sure what the next step is. Yeah, I mean, I think you're also very young in your journey. Like those old white males, a lot of times it's not because they're white males, it's because they've been doing it for 30 years and a lot of people buy experience. Like, I mean, if you've been able to scale to seven figures, you just got to keep doing it. Do you know what I mean? You're not going to convince anybody. Yes. You're definitely not going to convince them on the thesis of why are you picking these guys over me. Yes. That's not a compelling argument. I do remember you saying not to try to convince people. But have conviction. Okay. I mean, I just feel like a lot of times, what I'm worried about is you're making an ideological framework for yourself. Like I'm going to fucking show them. Like they're not, you know what I mean? Like even the way you said white male, older white male means that you have disdain towards it, which I think is actually a vulnerability. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like there's I know unlimited female, black, Asian, like there's there's people winning all shapes and sizes. Of course there's discrimination. Of course there's bias. Of course there's ways to go on getting equity to where we want. None of that is stopping your business. So don't focus on that. Bingo. Thank you. You got it. Okay. Okay. I'm trying not to cry here. Okay. What's your name? Erica. Erica. But I live in Melbourne. So I found you in 2017 when I was, I had my second baby was breastfeeding. I had my electricity on the payment plan. I was looking for coins to buy bread. I wasn't like America broke because I'm from America, but in Australia we were broke. And I kept, you know, because y'all we have a good year. Come on. Okay. So I was listening. I was watching your YouTube's and I found crushing it. And I heard you kind of give a loving bitch slap of like, who cares about your story. No one's coming to find you. You got to get out there and build it. And I started, I like quit my job and my husband was freaking out. He had no money, but I'm like, fuck it. Like it's here. I'm like, I'm not going to do this. And I wouldn't be here where I am if it wasn't for you. That first year of my business, I did my anchor podcast, like a fucking, I don't know what I was doing in my car. My hoops were hitting the apple fucking headphones. The E-tag was going off and beeping and shit because we didn't have money. And that podcast has like 2.6 million downloads now because of you. So thank you. You know, it's wild. So I did all that. And now we are where we want to be and we're, we're about impact. And I want to help millions of women. And I hear you always say, if you want to help millions fucking act like it with how you show up, your content, all that. I got Nina, my social media ballerina over there. Shout out to you. It's two of us trying to do, you know, the content and I fucking love it. I would do it underwater asleep fucking talking in my sleep. I love this shit. But how do we, I guess scale on socials and not fucking, I got two young kids and I want to like watch them grow up. Of course. Be like 24 seven and I love talking to people in the DMs. Yep. How do we do that with a very small team but wanting to kind of be everywhere because we want to reach maximum people by, by YouTube getting better at the, by, by YouTube being better at the content. Okay. Let me explain what I mean by that. We are living in the craziest era of social since I've started talking about this in 2006. People in here could not even have an account and tomorrow make a video that gets more views than both of us combined have ever gotten on the merit of the content. The way you can get bigger is by being better at the content. Do you understand what to do in the first three seconds of a tick tock? Yeah. Do you understand the titling? Do you understand what time to be posting? Do you like this is a craft. There's a, there's, there's a craft to being better at the content. So I think you've got the personality that can get you to a certain level. But if you're asking me a direct question of how do we get better? You get better by understanding moments of opportunity. A new platform pops out, which is why four years ago I was here saying tick tock, tick tock, tick tock because I knew what was happening there. But then when it gets mature and it's not that easy, you have to be better at the craft. I don't know how much time the two of you are spending on re, no, no, no, I'm really understanding how the algorithms work on understanding why a carousel ad will do this. Yeah. How, you know, how much are you posting on LinkedIn? Okay. Yep. I'm posting on LinkedIn. Right. And so at what time? Yeah. How many words? Quality over like a fuckload of posts. Both. Because we're not putting shit out. Like it's not shit just to do it. Like we're trying to put good shit, but it's a million platforms. Not because you know, sometimes you're like post 50 times a day and it's like half of that was shit. So we don't want to post shit. But what is shipping decided on the results or your subjective opinion of you creating your own homework? Yeah. Yeah. I think they're kids ugly. The boys like that one. Let's go fellas. Yeah. I think the biggest conversation that's not being had and the reason I'm sticking on this one is I know this will help all of you is are you good at your craft? Yeah. You know, like, do you understand what time to post? How long the copy should be? What the fam thumbnail should Mr. B spends $150,000 on a thumbnail. Mr. B spends $150,000 per thumbnail on his YouTube's. That would make me and all of you understand that a thumbnail matters. Most people here have no idea what their thumbnail is when they post whatever is fucking defaulted. Right? So I would say for you to more in the crap. You're welcome. Hi. Hi Gary. My name is Nick. I was part of eruption five. I was the attitude for 26 years and overcame that addiction to a hard-fuse clean now. Thank you. Thank you. So I post my journey on social media. I feel I'm making an impact. I'm still trying to get a fucking handle on life and it's a journey. I'm learning. We all are. Yeah. Yeah. And like I'm impacting people. I'm starting to be consistent in the gym and I'm getting fucking messages. I'm consistent in this too. This is amazing. And the thing is I'm unemployed. I'm just wondering, do you have any advice of how I can monetize what I'm doing? I mean, monetize, you know, do you want to get a job? Yeah. But that's, this is me. I love, I love posting my journey. But I'm asking you a really practical question because I want you to win. Monetizing is very challenging. Let me explain. You've got to either get brand deals. You've got to either be a big enough creator where you're getting meaningful money from the revenue share of the platforms, which you have to be at a very high level for that. You have to create a product to sell. All three of those are challenging. You could create a course or charge your audience. I think that changes the entire dynamic of it. So I think you have to be monetizing is challenging. The reason I'm asking is, do you want to get a job? I think the same tenacity you're attacking this with applying to 10 or 15 jobs a day with good copy and good videos is something you also have to give a thought to. Because I think the stability of having the job nine to five and then do content afterwards might take the anxiety off because when you're unemployed, it's on your mind. And then you may, you might actually be sitting on some, this is very important. I want everybody to hear this. You might be sitting on something very powerful, but you have to keep doing it for another three years before it goes to where you want it to. But if you're so anxious to turn it into money, you're going to lose your audience because they're going to feel it. And all you needed to do was get a nine to five. Oh my God. I fucking get that. Okay. Yes, I understand. Okay. Yes. Awesome. Welcome. Oh brother. I let, oh, I'm sorry, sister. I see you. Go ahead. I didn't realize about the four. I apologize. Go ahead, my man. That's all right. Firstly, welcome to Melbourne. We appreciate you. My name is Rayl. I'm a CEO and founder of a public company in the B2B space. Couple of questions. Firstly, tomorrow night, my mom, my wife makes a great chicken soup. Do you want to come for shabbos? Yeah. So that's an incredible invite, but I don't know if you know this. I'll be leaving at 4am on my way to Sydney and then to Brisbane back in America on Sunday. I'm on a fucking tour out here. We'll miss you at Shul, but next time. Next time. Secondly, look, you put out a lot of content recently around personal, around B2C. Yes. We're in the B2B space. What are you seeing in the B2B space? What's the next play? And I think it's really an untapped market. I agree. What do you think? So I think LinkedIn, and I've mentioned it already twice. Think about that. I'm obsessed with LinkedIn for B2B. Most VaynerMedia's growth right now is in B2B clients because we are annihilating LinkedIn because LinkedIn is acting like Facebook 10 years ago. So to me, LinkedIn for B2B is a golden era right now. The media and the creative opportunities, both on organic reach and creative, but then targeting CIOs or procurement, like the ad targeting is insane. It's like the shit that Facebook got yelled out for that they still have. So LinkedIn by far starting podcasts that are made for just a couple hundred people. Back to what I was asking that gentleman, do you really need scale? If you're in B2B and you're only targeting 850 companies in all of Australia, you only need 850 listeners. So a B2B podcast that you can do to then chop up so you have creative to run ads on LinkedIn is what I'd be thinking about. What are you seeing from a trend point of view as well? Product or service, what are you seeing over there in the States that's sort of coming across your desk? I just think the biggest trend is how AI is going to disrupt a lot of these products and services. You know, I think from a product standpoint, the AIification of so many of these products is like that warfare has begun. That's probably the biggest observation by far. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Darin. Thank you. I'll be quick with this one. My name is Chris. I am an ADHD leadership coach. Oh, I'm sorry, she's going over there. You're next. Go ahead. I work with leaders who have ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia. And you start talking about this idea of reverse engineering, what people find valuable. And this is something that I am particularly trying to integrate into my life because I do have an act for putting myself out in community, building my ideas by bouncing them off other people. Yes. I need to work with process to do this. Me too. Me too. But then making sure that I'm pulling out the right question to ask from all that information that I'm learning. And then how do I answer that question in a way that's going to be really powerful for an audience? So how do I reverse engineer that? By doing the reps, meaning by giving out all those answers and all those hypotheses. The volume is the breakthrough. The reason stuff is very clear to me is because a lot of the work I do is public and you don't see it. Meaning go look at every post I've posted, analyze it. Like you can see over a course of like six months, me get to the point through little steps on a daily basis. If you think about me being consistent, it's because it's small variations of saying the same thing in different context points until it hits the crescendo. This is the whole concept of perfection that everyone's got confused. Even the way you're thinking about it, right, is like so powerful. I think this could really liberate you by trying to get there over. Notice how you're like I need to do it verbalizing and I was like me too. The only difference is I'm not trying to solve the problem for a perfect answer one time. I'm doing it over and over through the content. That is amazing. You're welcome. Yes, darling. Go ahead. Hi. Hi, Gary. How are you? I'm good. Welcome to Melbourne. Thank you. In 2019, I've been diagnosed with multiple cirrhosis and I have affected eye moments and 40% but the thing is I still have done over a million dollar business in the last five years. My competitors are my haters. They hate me. Of course, I find the thing is... You do understand... You just said your competitors are your haters. They hate you, right? Yes. You do understand the number one goal every business has is for their competitors to hate them. That is a tremendous accomplishment. My market was earlier. We are male dominating market and I think I have done good being a woman. Now I'm entering because I have more than enough savings and I'm entering into B2B business. I will be probably opening my own RTO by this year and I'll be the sole director and CEO of that business. And now those who are right now hating me, I'll be into the business. Then those will be my prospective... So now the thing is... I don't tell everyone that I have MMS. I don't want to take pity. I want to just be positive about that they should take a positive... I'll be able to do the business. How should I create a positive impact on them? Well, I think first of all, are you going to still be in the prior business? No, I will be in it. My husband, he also helping me big time. He is there. So he will be in the prior business and I will be in another business now. So they're going to hate him? It's just that because my eye moments are not good enough. My problem is there and because of MMS obviously I yawn a lot. But I have wings. I want to fly as much as I can do. I am doing it. I'm not a woman who can say, die does and just cook and treat. I just want to do a lot of things in my life. I'll be honest with you. If your next thing was going to be would you invest in my business? The answer would be yes. You're so clearly motivated and capable. I'm almost embarrassed to answer your question because I don't think it's going to have any level of impact. I think you're going to will your way to success in your next business. I mean it. These prospective clients are either going to say yes or no. My intuition is if they all say no, you're going to take that feedback and come up with another thing that people are going to say yes to. That's what you do. You've persevered through all of what you've persevered through. You're just capable of navigating it. How am I going to make it positive or how do I make it positive? You've already decided that. The fact that you're not going to be in that other business is probably going to be a benefit. Some of those people are going to be smart enough to do business with you just to try to learn from what you did. You're going to be in the last business which is their business. Yeah, my last business. I just been following you and each and every video I see on Snapchat, on TikTok, on Insta, everywhere, I follow you on Twitter as well. Though the thing which has helped me a lot was the one video of yours where you said you don't need big cameras. You don't need anything. This smartphone is more than enough. I really got motivated enough and I am here because of you. This is what I can say. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? I'm well, my friend. This morning at 5 o'clock, I see the message on Insta. I'm excited to see you. I'll be glad if you can please reply me. I want to ask you, I'm a huge women's department. I've been a chef for 22 years and because of my wife, I quit the job and I did a full-time business from zero to six figure in six months. Amazing. I come from a family of doctors. My father is a spine surgeon. My mom is a physio. The main thing which really got me curious is how you said. I want to ask you for value. Clients were coming to me and they were having pain and they were doing. I was so curious about it. Why are they having these pain? I started looking at the competition. What I really found out, I actually got into the same bowl. During Covid, I injured my shoulder. I injured my back. I spoke to my badge. He couldn't really help me. I spoke to my mom. She couldn't really help me. I went to the physios. I went to the osteos. They gave me some correctional exercise which did help. I lost my motivation of exercising again. I started finding a gap. The gap what I realized was that the main thing what people really come into fitness is because they lack posture. Because of posture, when you are sitting down, doing any exercise, normally you go to the world-best gym. If people won't really fix your posture, there is a show that you are going to get injured. What I found was that I started digging deep in. I started having the best coaches out in the world. I came up with a plan that I want to look after. Especially women because they are hardworking women. They all support their family. To fix their posture before giving them a dream come true. I want to give you a six pack on a beach board. What I really want to ask is that when people come to me, first of all they want to see the senior which is physios. All of the places. I am giving them a lot of value. They let them dictate their life. And some day they come and question me. I feel bad in my integrity. I am trying to sort so many things. Sometimes I am not able to add that value of all the patient's hard work. And actually working with the curiosity. Going through depression, anxiety during Covid. To get that piece of product which is meant for vitality. Meant for being happy. Not going to the doctors. Having a lot of real life. I just want you to help me how can I get that value added to my business. So that people really think they take everything for granted. Oh you fix my leg. That's it. I am going to start working. What if five years or ten years later you are actually not able to work? They don't really think about it. I really want to sort of find a gap. And this is for mental health. And I have people. I have got this new way of exercising. What is the gap that you are trying to fill for yourself in this scenario? You feel underappreciated or undercompensated? No. I am actually trying to. Get that compassion. What I see in people. A vision where five years or ten years down the lane. If they would not come to me and they were still going through the process. As a fitness coach I want to bring that together. Yes I understand. But why? Because I love doing that. But okay. So if you love doing it you don't need the feedback loop for what you are asking for. I just want to say how can you add value. How can you make people. You have added value. But sometimes people don't take it that way. That is because you are looking for that validation. Okay. No that is true. How can I overcome that validation. And how can I break that process. By recognizing that a lot of times getting that validation comes later. You have been doing it for six months. Training I have been doing it for 17 years. My business started when I was left the job building code. And six months I grew up in business. I have been doing it for 17 years. I have been doing it for 17 years. My business started when I was left the job building code. And six months I grew up in business. And I was working. So the business is going on for 17 years. Got it. But full time I have been doing it. I think what is very clear and I get it. Is I just think that the validation that you are seeking. Is just not as going to be as transactional as you would like it to be. I will tell you one more thing. Can I ask one question. Real quick please. So when you said about the parents. Because they have been doctors. Yes. I think that is a good question. Because they have been doctors. I came as a chef. There was a huge intimidation. Of course. You can't be a doctor. I used to come to my father and say you are such a big doctor. How can I fix that. If you think that is a validation. Just give me one answer. Thank you. Why would you care about that. Let's talk about it. So your dad's friend. Your uncle. Knowing the history of doctors with a chef. You know when you were doing it. That was like the help. You know a chef right. I think that insecurity. Feeling is what is happening to you. With your need for validation from the patients. You are trying to prove something. I get it. Because that is a lot of judgment thrown at you. Coming up in your life. Of course. I think you got to let it go. It doesn't mean anything. I don't want to let it go. It just seeps inside me. I don't know why. It seeps inside of you. You were dominated by it. You were pounded by it. From your heritage. That doctor, doctor, chef. That was a lot. That was a lot to be thrown at you. You have got to release that. You have got to release it. You got it. Hey Gary. My name is Justin. I am an AI coach. I help CEOs and executive leaders elevate to their cognitive potential by using AI. One of the joys I have at the moment is working with the leadership team of a school. You mentioned some comments about school marks and clearly not reflective of SMARTS. The schools that we went through were designed in one way. If you got to redesign a school today that was more suitable to you with everything you know about AI with everything you know about what you need students coming in. Like. What are you putting in a school of the future that you are building? For me if I am thinking about creating a curriculum the concept of information memorization is ludicrous. Asking kids to memorize stuff for tests is silly when we have technology where it is today. For me I would try to build a school that was building self-esteem and was teaching kids how to interact and was teaching kids practical things like real rules of society. Like competition and merit. How to pay your taxes. What life insurance means. It would be completely based on common sense and kindness. Of course when people are like no Gary you don't get it you have to teach course skills. Do you know how many people are home schooled and learned at home? You can teach. Course skills are pick up on a ball. They are there. They are always there. You will teach math. I just think we don't think about positioning people for real life. It is all academia for the sake of academia. We have this cool opportunity to personalize the learning. Is there a class? Is there something you would love to go back and do differently? All of it. I hated school. The fact that I wasn't taught about marketing or proper investing or normal shit like it is crazy. We teach no life skills. And to the parents that are worried about privacy of AI data. Do you think that is a thing that we are going to shift our mindset around that? Every single person in this room's privacy and data has been compromised already. Yeah. It has. Listen. Nobody wants their data or privacy compromised but it has already happened. Every government has been hacked. Every organization. All your banks have been hacked. It is all there. I know what you are doing today. Thank you. Hi. Hi. My name is Forza. This is my mom Rebecca. I was wondering how I could convince my mom to let me have some social media platforms. So I could show my dancing and acting. I think that is a decision between you and your mom that I have no interest in getting involved in. But I would say to your mom there is a way to look, this is a philosophical thing for parents forever. For a lot of us in this room that our parents now what is going on with social media reminds me so much around alcohol. So alcohol. In America we banned alcohol in the 30s and 40s. Just like some people ask us to ban social media today. What it did was it created a byproduct of even worse behavior. People were still doing it anyway and our relationship with alcohol has never been great in our country for that reason. A lot of parents here know because we went to university and college with kids that parents were very, very strict and made everything demonized and the first week of college they got blackout drunk every night because they didn't know how to balance it. So I think today social media has that stigma for parents and I think for a lot of parents there is ways to do it in a way that can be a little bit of moderation at a time. Sometimes you can start with only the family members are able to follow the kid and things of that nature. So I think you and your mom have to have a second level conversation. You got to convince her mom it's not all or nothing. It's not like I want to go on TikTok and go crazy and you can't watch. Maybe you can make it a private account and maybe only you mom can decide who gets to follow me and get to see my stuff and maybe you start going a little bit one step at a time. I think too many kids and parents have the all or nothing approach without having maybe a slow and steady approach. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Hi Gary. I've been following you for a very long time. I work in the mental health space just recently and specialise in children, teenagers mainly. Yes. And Portia is 12, turning 13. Yes. And so many kids that I've seen already have got huge addictions to gaming, social media, online even watching gaming. And their parents want me to help them with their mental health. Yeah. But they're spending four or five hours a day online. So that's why for me it's really difficult for me to I get it. Here you go, here's TikTok and I know what the algorithms do for the undeveloped brain. Yeah, but just to put it into a different perspective when I was 14, a little bit older everybody was mad at models and magazines because they were so skinny and all the girls in my high school were in the bathroom throwing up because they all thought they had to be Kate Moss. Because we looked at magazines when I was in high school everyone was talking about people playing Nintendo for four hours a day or what or the TV was the problem. Humans are always going to be addicted to something. You know, like I think and by the way, you know this for every kid that you see in our living, there's another kid who is handling it. You know, and so I think parents just love their kids so much that this generation of parents you and I included is driven by fear at a level that we have not seen in parenting in a very long time. And that fear is making us do things that are very different. All of us that are in our 40s and above also had another thing. Our parents weren't up our fucking ass every minute like we are with our kids. A lot less claps for that one. So I think we've got a double issue at hand. We have the most fear based parenting generation of all time. And we have parents that are in our kids business at a level that is unheard of. So we have become micromanaging fear based mongers and our children are actually having counter effects to this. We think we're doing good. We're so up their ass they don't know how to be grown ups by the time they're torn. I'm not grilling you. I'm not killing you. I'm going to get my issues going to be like I told you. Look, I think the scariest thing on earth is to tell anyone how to parent their child. I think it's completely out of bounds. I will say that this has been going on for a while. I also have the luxury of interacting with people and ungodly amount of people. A lot of them are now 18, 20 and 22. And many hundreds of them work for me and many more 10,000 of them talk to me. And I can tell you that we've got to let these kids breathe a little bit. Just a little bit. We are so far up their ass. Most of us are strong. Because we were out in the jungle a little bit. What we're doing in modern parenting is we're educating zoo animals. We're putting them in these cages and we're trying to take care of them. I don't know if you know what happens to an animal that grew up in the zoo when they put them in the wild. They die within a minute. Because they go out to the real jungle and the lion tears their fucking head off. And so what I think is happening is that we are micromanaging and zoo animal mingling our kids so much out of fear because we love them so much and we know what they're doing every fucking second. And we're actually not preparing them for life. And I think like the old saying in Russian that is my favorite Russian saying it translates to everything is at its best when there is balance. And I think we have lost our collective balance. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey Gary. My name is Samson. And it's good to see you. You changed my life. Thank you. Seven years ago it's the first time I know about your content and then I was like one of those kids who's always been learning and never doing anything. And then I was in a very I was in a job kind of suffering a lot. And then so five years ago I read Crush It and then that kind of demonstrated to me how people who are successful and how much work they needed to get there they kind of gave me that awakening and then I quit my job and then I find something that actually maps to where I wanted to go. And two years ago I got into a digital marketing agency a bit size of advertising agency in Australia. And I'm very happy from there and I'm loving it. I'm not selling my crafts everyday. I'm saying thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And for me I know because I love you so much in the future. In the future? Not right now? I really want to kind of work for you. At Vayner? So email me at because we're exploding in Australia. We're hiring. I was going to ask what kind of tips you're going to give people around but you just gave me like directs, okay. What I do? Hi Gary. Hello. Hi. You're such an inspiration to me. I've been following you for so many years as well. I was a porcious age when I arrived on a boat as a refugee from Northern Iraq the Kurdistan region if you know. Of course. And then obviously as a person from that sort of background I've been through a lot but I never made an excuse to give up on my dreams and so on and so forth as everyone else is so inspiring here. But honestly I started reading on self-development a long, long time ago when I couldn't even speak English properly. But I think the most convincing person and also after having read your book especially the chapter about conviction it really made me it was like a punch in the face. I quit law. Actually two years ago when I was pregnant with my second child there were a few pregnant people while they were listening to you. I thought she was telling my story honestly. The beautiful lady in the pink from America. So when I was pregnant I was I don't know if anyone knows land leads but I was working for them not as a lawyer but as an admin assistant to make my life easier while I was pregnant so that I don't have as much stress as a lawyer. I remember walking along the I don't even know the name of the river but in the city I was listening to your podcast every single day while I had a different mindset at work and then outside I was pumped every single day walking to exercise to make my child healthy. And then I said you know what I will not go back to law I will never go back to business development management and so on and then I started creating NFTs which I had absolutely no idea about so I started creating NFTs and I only sold two but that's not the point two is better than zero. Exactly and then I started making reconnecting with my childhood love of drawing but of course to the disappointment of my parents my mom was like all my daughter does these days is draw. I was a human rights lawyer and all the education you can imagine when you become a lawyer and then I did master of international relations and then I'm doing absolutely nothing with it other than that it's just a stepping stone and maybe use it as a strategy that I have those things on my resume. But isn't that interesting that I, sorry I'm fascinating myself I guess sorry I don't know where that came from but what I'm trying to say is I disappointed my parents and and I'm obviously not proud of that but I for the first The number one thing that most people on earth should be doing is disappointing their parents Did you hear that? And I mean this here's why deep down especially immigrant parents like we all know the story deep down push comes to shove maybe not to your face but as a parent yourself the number one thing a parent wants is their child to be happy yes it is very obvious how parents get into this trap because we've lived through just like maybe our generation is micro-managing too much our parents generation and their parents generation valued their child's neighbors opinion too much yes most parents of the last two generations pushed their children to do things literally based on other people's opinions not even their own opinion about their own child 100% you should have disappointed your parents I should have done it way earlier that is disappointing but you know now that I'm 35 and you know it's funny because when you have kids and I've heard this from a lot of people and once you have kids and it was so funny hearing it from you when you said your father was only paying you 70K a year and then you realize much later you're like oh gosh he's not paying me at all so I should speak up so it's sometimes it requires some time of course of course but then one day you're like okay that's it I'm gonna follow my own path because of you know and by the way a lot of people get upset with me they're like Gary why are you saying this I'm trying to save you I'm like the quicker your kid disappoints you the more likely you'll have a long term relationship with your kid what people don't realize is people that kids that live their lives for their parents start to build resentment for their parents as every day goes by and the longer they continue to live their lives for their parents the more likely they're gonna have a poor relationship with their parents and it's evident evidenced by the relationship I'm having with my parents unfortunately because they're not understanding the path I'm taking which is now I'm about to go live with my product I'm not here commercializing that but I'm just so proud of myself despite the backlash and the you know the sort of you know the whatever they've given me I basically feel like I'm on my own on my own path even though the support can I give you good news they're gonna get over it I have a really good idea I have a store that does custom shirts yes and I want you to make a shirt for your parents that says draw over law truly truly and I want you to give it to them oh very good yes wait till they're fucking face absolutely yes thank you yes you're sure I wish you better than your heart desires get over it a little bit hey Gary you're next hi brother yes I know who you are yeah it's a third continent we've seen each other on this year pretty cool yeah very very pleased very fortunate so last time we spoke in VGON I mentioned the Tokyo Dads podcast that I'm working on I'm standing by I was scared you were already there and there was going to be time so today I want to delve into parenting a little bit and you've mentioned many times specific instances that your parents have done certain actions yes you know you remember like your dad's handshake your mom praising you when you open the door yes now what are some things that you do specifically in practice with your children to install these things I do very similar things so what he's referring to for the people that are really deep in my content I talk about these singular moments where I got positive reinforcement my mom the thing I think a lot about with parenting is like if you tell your kids it's all about straight A's they get formed into like believing and listening to the system and they just become workers or listen blindly or if you over praise your children they become insecure or being beautiful they become insecure as they get older because their validation sits in their looks or their athletic ability or their school so I think a big thing for all leaders here whether for parents or your employees is what are you praising and validating and so for me I follow a very similar blueprint you know with my son he's got a lot of empathy he's got a lot of feelings towards his friends you know I think about this one game he had in baseball where he hit a line drive and it hit the coach in the chest he fucking nailed it was a great hit and instead of running to the base he stopped and went and checked on the coach and I continued to bring that up to him literally every other week that he had more compassion to see if the coach was good than his own selfish needs or excitement to succeed in the sport he was playing with my daughter I think about things about like when I see that she's not putting too much pressure on herself you're basically watching and you're thinking about what validation systems you can do on things that are going to benefit them based on their personalities back to the reverse engineering we talked about earlier so look I think I think if you love yourself and you're good to other people your life will always be good there's unlimited people on earth who are deeply happy making $46,000 a year in annual income they exist at scale and so I think we put so much time and effort into so many other things and you know for me I'm spending all my time trying to make sure that they're just happy actually and it starts with reinforcing nice behavior either for others, think about the first story I told you or to oneself think about the second story thank you so much for sharing last one I'll take questions hello Gary hey brother so my name is Mark I'm 22 years old, firstly I am vlogging this I'm going to say hi to my vlog because they told me I wouldn't be able to say hi to you vlog what's good thank you Gary and thank you for tweeting back at me best day of my life I've been watching your content for a while and I love everything you talk about patience, gratitude and execution and I live by it I'm 22 and I taste test everything and I lead into curiosity my problem is with patience and it's not because I want a million dollars and it's not because I want to make it it's because this Monday I'm going to be I love social media where it's like advertising or being an influencer and I'm relaunching my dad's business and I'm happy to be patient and do it patiently but I don't understand how to be patient when my family's health is deteriorating I have a deep love for my parents I didn't give a fuck how much money I make I really want to make it for my parents I really don't care we've been renting for so long all I want to do is make it for them how do I lead into patience this is a very common question because I talk about patience a lot and this framework I get a lot of questions about like Gary that's fine and dandy but my mom is terminally ill and she's going to be gone in less than two years for sure and you can't tell me patience I have to make it before she goes and I say to that person this is incredibly challenging I'm so sorry this is the worst fuck I'm devastated but you being impatient and taking shortcuts is not going to create the thing you want anyway I'm giving you the answer to the following as their health deteriorates so what do you... like talk it through logically for me building anything meaningful takes time so what are you going to do differently like what's going to happen you think there's a shortcut you think I'm going to tell you some trick you think I'm going to give you a tidbit just not how it fucking works it's just like you know I know you talk about you gave up your 20's to live out your dreams and stuff like that I've done the same no you haven't but I've given up a lot what? but you didn't give up you just said I've given up my 20's or 22's I haven't started I don't go out I'm leaning to doing things that I enjoy rather than going for things that have instant gratification well hold on I'm leaning into things that you enjoy like that making me happy well then you didn't give up shit sounds like you're being selfish you're giving up going out things like that but you don't like that anyway you like this more so what the fuck did you give up I guess that's true okay so thank you I guess that's true but I want to help you here this is why we're doing this you didn't give it up good okay how do we overcome this issue of patience when there's like things that just can't be changed do you recommend taking shortcuts do you recommend taking a faster route do you watch my content and think I'm going to tell you to take a shortcut that's the only question I have what's the shortcut talk this through because it's very fascinating to me talk me through this shortcut like shortcut what's the business my dad's business he's a show for business so what shortcut are you going to take to make this show for a business 10 times bigger to make it before their health deteriorates clickbait stuff clickbait stuff clickbait stuff so do that yeah I guess what's clickbait stuff I don't know shady marketing strats I can't think of them on the spot because I try to be genuine when I market but like what do you think is going to happen what's shady you're not doing a fucking click funnel in a mastermind true so what's shady what are you going to like trick someone to take the fucking cap like what are you going to knock on people's door and throw them in the car and drive and tell them they owe you 30 bucks it's a good play like I why I'm doing this with you is you're talking philosophy the biggest issue that so many people have is they talk about things in theory versus reality if you just listen to this I'm doing this for everyone here like what are you going to do like you just I'm going to try my best yeah but like you know which is amazing you're coming from a good place you'd like this for them but like I don't think you have an answer to the shortcut right so you have no other choice so what are you going to do when you start for your dad's business what's the plan well he's had it for a while honestly I love you dad but it hasn't been profitable for a while so I'm relaunching it I'm going to be doing the advertising I'm going to try managing finances and I really want to just like boom his business just by stopping just by cutting costs not profitable you've already advanced it dramatically that's not a shortcut that's working a P&L probably thank you Gary you're welcome and um you said if you don't ask you'll never know so would I ever be able to get you on my podcast which is about finding gratitude and happiness you know one thing that I said up there is I'm working more on my candor and so yeah yeah no listen I'm working on it too like no bullshit years ago 10 years ago I would say yes and everybody would clap and then like there'd be an 80% chance I went into it right and I don't want to be that person the answer is maybe if you email me and in the title put I was the kid that was looking for the shortcut you know maybe we'll sneak it in you find the clickbait thumbnail anyway I look for it I love you dad I love you back ladies and gentlemen Gary Manichalks thank you thank you
