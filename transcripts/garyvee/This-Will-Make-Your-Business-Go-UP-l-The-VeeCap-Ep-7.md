## Transcript
What the fuck is everyone doing here? The platforms, the agencies are here to get the money of the brands? The brands are here to get awards to justify to their boards that it works? Like what are we doing here? Like who wants to talk about the truth? Half the people here in the drink rosé and fucking jerk off for a week? We have to also recognize that this is one big sales conference. This isn't about creativity. That's bad. Like I don't want that for this industry. Like what are we doing here? What are the great values of CAN? One of the great values of CAN is that it's a unique opportunity to see lots of people over a condensed period of time. Going to events and doing face to face where lots of like-minded individuals are there is always a good business strategy. When I think about the way I came up the game, my courage to say hello to anyone I admired or wanted to be associated with was always there. When you have a balance of humility and confidence in approaching people that you admire at an event like CAN, you are able to get the full enjoyment out of it. Find that balance, but never ever leave an event like CAN with regret. Landing back home on the following Monday or weekend and saying I wish I would have is always the wrong strategy at CAN. Good to see you brother. How are you? Very good. Very good. We wanted to talk to you a little bit about today. It was actually to have Gary give some insight into how he's seen the world of marketing sort of evolve. The 50 to 100,000 people that are here this week, I may be the only person, and I believe this by the way, that believes that organic social media is disproportionately the primary marketing mix. The top 5 to 7 brands within your portfolio need to be posting dozens of social media ads a day to dozens of consumer segmentations. I think the biggest issue for big brands is not awareness. Awareness is not the issue in this little cabana. It's relevance. All right, we got some meat in and we got out of there in time. Good to see you. How you been? I'm really good. How are you? I like the button game brother. Such a pleasure. Real pleasure to meet you. Thanks for doing this. Looking forward to it. I will tell you something. I have two daughters, 22 and 26. What's coming on my feet is what they need to know now and the urgency for them to get jobs and I send them everything that you do. Thank you. Thank you. Of course I know what. Let's get started. Get started. I don't think people understand how many SMBs fully and only survive on Google search ads. The combo of SEO and SEM is the foundation to hundreds of thousands if not millions of businesses with a massive looming change to search. The reason there are so many small businesses around, especially in America but around the world that are called AAA dry cleanings or AAA this is because you would show up first in the yellow pages because it was alphabetical and so in the 60s, 70s and 80s everybody started changing their names to AAA insect repeller. That is literally the reason that AAA is one of the most famous names of a business around the world and then obviously search changed my family business. I bought the word wine for five cents. The word wine, not even a long tail, wine for five cents the day it came out went to 10 cents pretty fast as a floor on Google in the first six months but search built by dad's business. That was fun. You know it's funny we started this like three or four years ago. It's hard to get deep deep because I came for the first six, seven years and consumed a lot of this. I'm like okay but can we go to 201 or 301 and this was fun. This gets in it. This is Scott Harrison from Charity Water. Let's clap it up for this man. Almost 20 years ago in a bar in Manhattan where we got to know each other and he said something very nice to me at the end of the dinner. Gary I've got a good read on you. You're a good guy. You're going to go out and build for yourself and you're going to make some money and then I really believe and this is him literally 20 years ago saying I believe you'll give a lot of that money away and try to change the world in a good way and then he said words I will never forget as I stand here tonight he goes why not start now. There are 700 million people in the world that don't have access to clean water. It's 10% of our earth and so I've been very honored to be part of the journey being a well-membered VaynerX our company is donating $10 million over the next 10 years. Say it again for the people in the bar! No weird boat we're giving 10 million over 10 years. So your book Why Now? A combination of a couple things. One both from creators and from brands where I live in both of those worlds I could feel the tension this whole movement that I talk about in the book about the tiktokification of social media. You could feel like from the incumbents of creator land they can feel it's harder to get views and the big brands are feeling that brand is starting to actually be built in social in a way that makes them uncomfortable. It's less television it's more social and I always write when I feel like I can provide something and so it felt like the confusion of the current moment we're in with social was an opportunity to help people. What do you want people's one take away to be? Can they get one thing away from what would that be? That organic social media creative is disproportionately underestimated by almost everybody on earth and that there's a substantial strategy and skill set to be good at it. Not happy Tuesday or a photo of three of us can. It's not spray and pray. It's not throw against the wall and see what sticks. It's not matching luggage to your campaign. It is the punchline. I think by far the best part of CAN is reconnecting with friends and making new friends. I think the best part of this industry is the people and I think the one take away is this industry continues to disrespect social media creative at a level that makes no sense when you think about actual business and I think it overvalues the medium of television and undervalues the medium of social media and that would be the one thing that I would want for people because the second they make that shift their actual business goes up which eliminates the cynicism of marketing. Awesome. Thank you so much. I'm Nicole Perlopian on the CMO at 2B and I'm with Gary Vaynerchuk, the CEO of VaynerX. Bestselling author. This man makes a lot of bets and has a vision for where things are going before they actually start to happen. The distribution of creative is changing and this has always been the thing that I've been most fascinated by which is why do we hold on to yesterday in the face of today's truth? How could you possibly not understand the relationship between social and streaming really for the business people in the room? It's very clear that the way we're going to advertise on streaming service looks a lot more like social. What people don't understand is it's eventually going to be all of your turns. VaynerMedia, we've come and disrupted the industry heavily. Well guess what? Because we make more quality creative at scale for social. I don't know if you heard but AI creative is a problem for me. Like nobody's safe. Technology doesn't give a shit about your feelings. And so I think to answer the question when will it change? It only changes in pain. And I think a lot of that is on the horizon because the advancements of technology, that's what it does. So I think for all of you, especially for your own career, you need to think about what's the commoditization of you. See you in the future. It's for me too. How are you? I love it. I love it. What's up? What's your advice? Yeah, we're kind of coming into the new world, right? Make. Make sure. Yeah. You have no barriers. Just like I was talking about how the world changed. Make shit and put it out. Don't talk about it. Don't resume it. Make. The people that make have it come to that. You got it? Yeah. Like whatever you want, whatever your goals are, if you make stuff and put it out, if it does well, it will come to you. Does everyone excited about the Olympic torch? That's what all that cheering was. Yeah. I thought it was that really good point I made about creator arbitrage. Patrick, I'm really excited for you to read this. The argument I make here is that organic social, because of how strong the algorithms are, are an incredible indicator to mitigating creative risk, which then can lead to a better measurement opportunity for sales and brand. I think you'll get it. I'm jealous. I'm not. I'm jealous. I'm jealous. Thanks for coming. One more up. One more? Yep. For joining, I'm Gary Vaynerchuk, chairman of VaynerX. A lot of familiar faces and friends. I just want to thank you. I know there's a lot going on this week, and we really genuinely appreciate you joining us for lunch. I thought it would be a nice opportunity for all of us to hear the incredible wisdom from this man. And I think where he's taking it is a real worthwhile conversation, especially in a very chaotic week. So without further ado, let's give a huge round of applause for this legend right here to the left of us. So for 20 years, I've been obsessed with leadership and well-being. So what we look at is measurable ways to see corporate well-being, joyful employees, as you can see, employees automatically translate into happy customers, happy customers automatically translate into happy investors, which is a happy business. So that's the basis of corporate well-being is also about leadership. But if the leader ignores an employee or part of his team, then the rate of disengagement is about 45%. But if you notice a single strength, the rate of disengagement falls to less than 1%. In the US, we lose 300 billion dollars from disengaged and actively disengaged employees. Actively disengaged means they are unhappy. If you have somebody who's happy and noticed other strengths, then that's a good story. And people don't buy products, they don't buy services, they buy a story. The best of this in the world have inspiring stories. This kind of thing is very helpful. I agree. He had the death stories. I was watching you while he was talking. No, no, no, definitely. I'm paying attention. I'm coming up with a whole different approach. Yeah, I think that's it. You have to change your perspective. You can't change how you're going to interact with people if you have the feeling. You think they're going to listen because they're scared? It's not how people work. That's not what people want. They want positive reinforcement. What you have to work on is not being fake positive. It's being real positive. Marketing executives and entertainment figures are gathering in Cannes this week for the annual Cannes Lions Festival this year. Industry figures are highlighting the human element and creativity and advertising as the sector faces pressure from AI. Well, you can see she's parked her boat. She's on the key and she's got a guest with her now. Tanya Brier joins us now. Steve, thank you so much. Yes, I wish I could say it's my boat. It's actually my guest boat, Gary Vaynerchuk. Thank you so much for having me on your boat this morning, Gary. Of course, AI is a big theme. How it's disrupting the advertising landscape. Our market is fearful, do you think? I think humans are fearful. When new technology comes along, we're scared. When electricity was invented, people said that there were demons in it and most people didn't put it in their home yet. All the modern technology, social networks, computers, cell phones, people were comfortable with their BlackBerry before the iPhone. I think there's reservations. Obviously an advertising industry like that's a Cannes is not as deeply technically sound as let's say Silicon Valley. There's a lot of misunderstanding. Look, it's also a massive technology where there's still lots of figure out. I think fear is probably 90% of it and then the 10% that are optimistic and on the offense, they tend to be the ones that win. That's amazing. Thank you so much for being here. Of course. It's the happiest ever. Amazing. It's the happiest ever. Gorgeous. I know. It really is actually. It's really amazing. I know. Incredible. All right, we're continuing with marketing for now. Michelle, why don't you tell everybody who you are and what you do? Sure. Hello. My name is Michelle Ergon. I'm a marketing and strategy at Spectrum range, which is the advertising sales division of charter communications. It's funny. Like as a company, video company, we want to do more video. Don't even get me started. You just said something that has been dropped. Do you know that it drives me crazy that the social network apps themselves stink at social media marketing? It is. I can't. I love you so much because I've triggered something I haven't thought about in a little while. It drives me crazy. Facebook's Facebook account. Triggering. Snap spotlight account. X's X account. Even within their own damn platform, they're not doing best practices. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Gary, thank you so much for letting me do this. Happy to do it. Thank you for switching us from a public beach to a private island. That's awesome. Another nature. I was hyped for the beach. Amazon Prime and Amazon is a monster that is going to unleash on the world that's going to be gnarly. You're going to watch shows and everything's going to be shoppable. In five to seven years as the tech stack gets done and as consumer behavior, you're going to literally be watching Emily in Paris and you can pause the screen and buy her hat on Amazon in two seconds. It's going to be no friction. I'm going to be watching the Jets on Amazon Prime and when a player, a new rookie makes a great play and I'm going to buy his jersey on the spot. It's going to be frictionless. You have that really crazy technology to know which brand this is. That's coming. And you know how subtle it is? This could be any fucking brand. And for the technology to know, know by the stitching, like you know what I'm saying that is? That they're going to be able to map that and somebody can buy those green pants in the middle of this podcast. It's fucking profound. Well, you know, it's funny. That's somebody just said something to me. The COO of LinkedIn, the number two at LinkedIn was in line. We've interacted, but I don't really know. We're in line to that event. He goes, you know what? I appreciate about you. I'm like, tell me. He goes, I've always in my whole career appreciated people that can take complicated things and break them down and make them understandable. He goes, that is your gift. And I believe that too. The fact that now at 48 years old, there is a substantial amount of human beings that walk around the earth that are asked, what's it really like to work for Gary or what's he really like? And that I know that 93.7% of them have incredibly good things to say. And that is by far my biggest accomplished professional.
