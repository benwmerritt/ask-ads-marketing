one of the most flattering things ever to me was, ever. Because I have so much admiration for you. In my career was, ah! You got your perspective. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I just wanna be happy, don't you wanna be happy? Hey everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk and I continue playing around with an interview format of just interesting people who are doing interesting things. And today, one of my favorite entrepreneurs, and I'm excited to say that because I have a very funny feeling, the millions of people over the next five decades that listen to this or watch this video or listen to this podcast, will be intrigued by me stating one of my favorite entrepreneurs when I'm talking about really one of the great music icons of my generation, one of the great songwriters, one of the great band members, one of the great music personalities. My entetter is with me today. I think we'll talk about a bunch of stuff, including our love affair with our great friend, Aetan Shugerman. But more importantly, I'm gonna try some new things on this format I decided because I love Ryan's business brain and we're gonna talk about some current events and different things. And really just how humans work because I think when you're a songwriter at his scale, just knowing what humans will be touched by is a skill. I feel like I have it in certain ways. I feel like others that I observe have it. And I think Ryan has it at the highest level. So Ryan, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, Gary. How do you, when people actually, it's funny that I said that when somebody like literally is on a plane, here's a good one, you get on a plane, you know, and you're just flying and somebody looks sitting next to you, just nice cordial combo you're about to take off and she or he just says, hey, so what do you do? How do you answer that? That's a really interesting question. I do get asked that on occasion. And I say, I typically say I'm in, a little bit of it, it's a little bit of that is my first answer. And because if I get into what I do specifically, I kind of give them phases to see, am I gonna engage this conversation? How far am I gonna go? Right, when you say that, when you say that, some people may just clam up and pay, this guy's got tattoos on his arms, maybe he's doing something shady or maybe like, you'll see how, if they wanna double click into that. Correct, I see if they wanna double click the ad, right? So I kind of, I'm very nice, very cordial on airplanes and I've had some phenomenal conversations, but if they go further than I say, I'm in music, what do you do? Well, I'm a songwriter, I'm also a recording artist. And I, you know, and I just- When you add the record, if you, it's funny, this is so interesting how life works. If you kind of have some work to do or you're tired or not feeling great or just don't wanna engage, you may go all the way, you may hold off the recording artist part, right? Because if you just say songwriter, you can kind of wrap up and move on. The second photo recording artist, like, oh, who are you? Yep, correct, 100%. And a lot of times what happens though, on airplanes, I'm not like that, I'm at that kind of comfortable level of notoriety or celebrity where I get noticed, like in LA or New York or wherever, maybe once or twice a day, I get stopped, right? And they're usually very respectful, very cool. When I'm in an enclosed airplane for six hours or whatever it is, I'm not trying to get stopped. You know what I mean? And the flight attendants very often know who I am. And so that will kind of tee it off. But more or less, you're right. I try to see how far do you wanna go down this road. I leave out the recording artists. I focus on songwriting. And a lot of times I have great conversations because people are fascinated about songwriting. They don't understand it. So yeah, I've had that conversation more times I can count. When did you consider, when did you know you wanted to be a songwriter and why? I knew I wanted to be a songwriter in 1994, 95, when I found out that there was a guy named Babyface that was writing all these Boys to Men records on Bended Knee and like into the road. And then I discovered Diane Warren. And once I discovered that... How old were you? I apologize. I was mid 90s. I was 14. 14. And this was the first time you're like, wait, there's humans that do that. The person that's singing it isn't necessarily writing it. Oh, that's neat. That was the equivalent of being eight and finding out Santa Claus wasn't real. Because for most people, they assume that they're artists. And to some extent, like bands, it's very often bands write their own material. That's a very like, you know, exclusive club. But once I discovered that a lot of my favorite records were written by three or four people, it was like, psh, oh my God, that is the coolest job of all time. Cause you get the access, but you don't necessarily have to be front facing. And so then I do head first in the songwriting, but as I was doing that, I knew I wanted to be an artist. I knew I wanted to sing my own material. And so I was concurrently developing my voice and playing guitar, piano, drums, bass. I was an only child, so I had nothing but time. What, neither your parents musical? My dad was a gospel songwriter in the 70s. All throughout, this is pretty much the majority of the decade of the 70s. He toured, he opened up for Elvis back in the day. He opened up, not him, but like his group. He opened up for a lot of huge artists in the 70s and he wrote quite a few gospel records. So yeah, he didn't pursue music, but he had that window of time where he was about to and then he didn't take the jump at the end of the day. Did he regret that? Yes. He would tell you. Did that stick with you? Did that become a real, I love that. I talk so much about regret. And I think when people are fortunate enough to have someone they have a good relationship with and they love and loves them, if they're able to take the best parts of seeing someone they love have regret, it becomes an incredible potion to patience. Correct, correct, you're 100% right. And I knew that he was less than thrilled with himself for he got offered a publishing deal, songwriter deal in LA with a very famous producer back in the 70s. And he'd just recently got married and long story short, it was like that. Were you already on the way or not yet? I was not on the way. I think I was like, they were planning. And they were thinking. They were thinking about it. You were in your parents' minds. 100%, 100%. And my dad went to school and was in a group with Kathy Lee Gifford. And she, this is wild, this is wild. I'm not so big. This isn't good. And she ended up with a deal, record deal with CBS Records and ended up, I mean, she had stars in her eyes from day one. I think she did. And my dad, and my dad wrote all of her albums, like two albums in a row, he wrote all the material. So he was kind of on that bandwagon headed west and it didn't go that way. So for me, I- And because did he think it was the right thing to do to not take high risk? Was he a little fear? Like, what was his makeup? Did you extract that of him? Was he- I would say, I mean, see, yes. So I'm fear based. I'm from a very religious upbringing. Christian, oral Roberts, like- I see. To this day, my parents and lots of aunts and uncles are very entrenched in this. I see, I see. And so you understand that paradigm? I understand. It is a fear based decision make. Like don't, you know, you're getting married. I mean, I'm not making this up. You're getting, they would say like an MRS degree, like get a Mrs. degree, like by spring or else, you know? And so you've got people getting married at 22 so they can have sex because they've literally been virgins their whole life. There's a lot of- Right. A lot of- By the way, by the way, that was very, you know, I, you know, it's so funny. I was born in communist Russia where religion is banned, all of them. But everybody got married really young for the same reasons. It was culturally in the 70s, more like the US in the 20s in Russia. And so you just didn't have sex out of wedlock. And when you were 18, 19 and those hormones are running, it's like I was literally born nine months, one day short of nine months to the day of my parents' wedding night. Wow. My parents got married on February 15th and I was born on November 14th. That is wild. I mean, more or less that's what I came from. I get it. I get it. My uncle who are still missionaries, funny enough, they actually moved to communist Russia. They lived there in the 80s before, you know- That was a thing. Yeah, they were followed by the KGB. They were handing out Bibles and secret churches. So I'm with you there. And so if you understand that paradigm, that kind of religious construct, a lot of your decisions are informed by fear of- Correct. Oddly retribution. And God will not approve of this. God told me to do this, told me not to do that. And I'll play this much. When you're from Oklahoma or Arkansas, like in the South, moving to LA to pursue a dream or New York is, you might as well go to Mars. It's like, mom, I wanna go to Mars. And so for me- Your dad grew up in that era and circumstances. Yes. Where he was given, ironically, the God given talent. Correct. To do something yet the framework of society. And I talk a lot about the internet. You and I are also very fortunate that we're in the primes of our careers with a scaled internet. I think I would be remarkable in any generation. You know, one of my favorite things right now is a bunch of fake entrepreneurs running around saying that they can't be as successful because of Biden and I'm laughing. Like literally I'm like, I was successful during Clinton. I was successful during Bush. I was successful during Obama. I was successful during Trump. I'll be successful during Biden. Like real entrepreneurs win regardless. Like, you know, but I also know that the internet really enables more scale. Yes. So I just think about timing and things of that nature. So that was always in the backdrop for you, which probably you know, could have worked either way depending on your makeup and your parenting could have made you also scared or gave you that spring in your step. That's what it gave me. It gave me the spring in the step. Real quick, I apologize. You said that baby face and all that hit your radar. Yet your dad was doing it. Did you know what your dad was doing? Did you know? So he was doing it by the time that I was cognizant of what my father was doing. He was selling like jewelry. And what he was the guy like, if you're trying to get that hard to get Rolex or Patek. Ryan, was it as extreme as you genuinely didn't know and then said to your dad, there's a guy baby facing, he's like, I did this. Or are you kind of new in the backdrop because it's your dad. You don't really put the two and two together. I didn't connect it. I knew that my dad, see, my dad was in a group in the 70s. So I knew that he was writing gospel but under the framework of his own group. They were called world action singers, living sound. Gospel blew up in the 70s. You had to get the gospel going. Leon Russell. So my dad was doing records with the, like guys like Leon Russell, a lot of these LA session players. But under the framework of his own band. So I still didn't connect it. He was writing for other people. And I thought that anytime an artist sang a song that they didn't write, that it was a cover song, that they were covering someone else's previous hit. Like in the 70s when Chris Christofferson would write something and he covered. So I didn't connect it. And then I ended up going to, I know I wanted to go into entertainment. I knew I wanted to create. I knew 100%. I had a floor-ice scholarship for acting, which I didn't take. And I've been playing piano since I was three, started writing songs at 15. And all of a sudden around age 17, I wrote a couple of songs that to my ear were as good as what was on the radio. And that's what I was aiming for. Like I'm going to quietly workshop this stuff until I'm good enough to where the moment I step on stage, everyone's going to go, where the hell would that guy come from? So I won a record deal at 1920 years old on MTV, on TRL. And get this, didn't tell my mom I was going to New York, didn't tell my family I was going to New York, none of my call drewmates. Nobody knew that MTV was flying me to New York to play a song that I wrote by myself in my dorm room. And all of a sudden my whole family finds out that I can sing, write and perform all on the same day on TRL. And I won that. Get the fuck out of here. What year was that? 2000, 2000, 2001. So really in the, like towards the tail end of the super hype of TRL? Correct. It was the peak of TRL. Like if I could, it was the peak of it because I was on TRL. This is when Carson was on there or he, Carson and Diddy was coming in every day and just. Correct, correct. It was the epicenter of culture, dude. When I pulled up in Times Square, because a year before I went to New York, a year before almost to the day, I went to New York with a friend of mine, crashed to my uncle's church down in Lower East Side, went and hung out in Times Square. I got plucked out of the crowd to be on TRL. They wanted me just like sitting in front of the camera and to introduce the number one video. And Dave Holmes or Carson, whoever it was, pulls me over to drop a pin in when this was. He pulls me over to, like introduce number one. And he goes, he goes, we got a brand new number one this week from a brand new single and a big debut for a new artist. We think she's going to be huge. Ryan, can you intro it? And I go, well, following the number two this week is the offspring, which was, you know, I'm pretty, you know, give it to me, baby, or whatever that song was, right? And I go in the new number one debut video for TRL this week, Britney Spears hit me, baby, one more time. That clip exists. That clip exists. Yeah. That was the year before. And so then a year later, I ended up on TRL and I in sync was at its peak, TRL was at its peak. And then I win the record deal. Timbaland is watching this show. He happens to watch this episode. My record deal doesn't really matriculate into much of anything over the course of the next year. I'm flown to Nashville, LA, New York, Nashville. And Timbaland calls me, I moved to New York upon graduation. I'm living in Hoboken. And this group and Atlantic record just trying to sign me to be a part of the group. Once I realized that this is not a band, it's a boy band. I was like, peace, I'm out. Timberlake actually was the one who told me, I've known Justin since we were both whatever 20. And he's like, yeah, yo, dude, you don't want to do that, man. Boy bands are going out, bro. You want to get out. So I piqued out. Dude, your JT voice is much stronger. That was really well done, dude. It's not bad, bro. It's not bad. So then I go to Nashville. One day I get a phone call from a Virginia Beach number, 757. I still remember the number. And it's Timbaland who at the time, at the time, biggest producer alive by a landslide. You ready for this? This is just like how I love life. Yeah. Look at this. Look at my latest. Too miscalled. Is that all time? That's incredible. There it is. Life, how funny life is. Keep going. There it is. Small, full circle, right? So yeah, so he ends up calling me. He's a yo, dude. I saw that show on TRL, man. He's like, man, you tight, you tight, bro. You tight, you know? So he flies me to New York, Manhattan Center Studios. And he's working at the time with Birdman and whoever else. And I signed with Timbaland. For two years, I followed Timbaland around America. I moved to Miami. I'm with Timbaland living in his apartment in Aventura, crashing on his bus. I'm with Scott Storch. I was with him the day he rode Crimea River, the demo. He came in the bus, he said, Ryan, get in my bus. And he comes in and plays me the demo. And I was like, that's a yo, what? I couldn't even understand it. I was there for the Future Set Love Sounds, that whole album, Sexy Back, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott. The first session I had with him in Dallas, I remember Missy Elliott was there, Usher was there, JT was there. And they did, if they're on the pit-pit-down, yeah. Fickin' on the pit-pick. Like, is it worth it? Let me work it. Put the thing down, flip it and reverse it. And so I watched Tim at his creative genius, like Apex, changing culture. And I took that in about a year and a half later. I got my first cut with Bubba Sparks in about a year and a half into working with Tim. I was in Colorado for Christmas, whatever, hanging out, pulled up my MPC, sat down, I was like, well, I gotta write my own stuff. And like, pretty much the first thing I wrote was apologize. And I had Tim's drums, because I had a bunch of Timbland sounds, and I just made up, like, through the piano down. And then you go, oh, that sounds like a band. I think I'll call it Republic. And then it became OneRepublic. And that's kind of the five-minute synapsis on that whole journey from TRL to OneRepublic. And we were the last band, along with Paramore, to play TRL before they turned the lights off, which I thought was really kind of- Symbolic. Yeah, yeah. When I introduced you just now and said, entrepreneur, how did that land in your own mind? You're like, oh, Gary's being nice. Oh, he's right. Or it's cool that Gary sees me that way. Or it's neat that he sees that. Or yes, I am. Or I can't wait to do more. Like, how did that land? Probably a little bit of all the above. I'm so used to being introed as a songwriter, but ultimately, or an artist, but that is an entrepreneur. You're manufacturing something out of nothing, figuring out where culture sits with what you're creating, finding that true market fit of your record. And the reason I got into entrepreneurial, funny enough that the degree that I was pursuing initially in college was a entrepreneurship degree. And I just like creating things, man. And you said something really interesting a minute ago. You said, the connection between writing a hit record or a hit TV show or whatever, and the parallels between investing in something or creating something, creating a brand or a company that also resonates with the world. They're so similar. Bro, I'm blown away. I mean, we've talked about this off screen. Like, one of the most flattering things ever to me was, ever, because I have so much admiration for you. In my career was maybe 18 months ago when we started talking more often and you're hitting me up of like, hey Gary, your music understand. Like, you know these people. Like about, you know, I've always been like, yeah, just it, to me, the baby and TikTok and Supreme or Kith or Bushwick or Dumbo, real estate, I just play one game of, I'd see something before somebody else sees it because I understand human beings. Dude, that is my whole game right now. I started investing years ago alongside Gio Sarri and Ashton initially, Abe Burns who ran that, your investments became my homie, then Paul Wachter, got connected with a lot of the different kind of like, forecasting minds in Los Angeles and obviously not, you know, goes without saying you in New York and picking things, investing in things that to me, I use myself as a litmus test, as a barometer. If I like something, I see so much shit around the world, traveling around the world, 300,000 miles a year, I see stuff popping off in Madrid, New Zealand, Sydney, Hong Kong and when you are constantly injecting yourself into global culture. Listening. Listening, tapping in and paying attention. Inevitably, 20% of the comments on this YouTube video are gonna be like, Gary, stop being a dick, Ryan has so much good to say, stop interrupting him. And I always think about him like, my God, I'm so hyper listening, so intuitive, I know what the person's gonna say, I know that this is over in 22 minutes, I wanna get to so much shit, I knew what he was gonna say, but I'm not the greatest interviewer because I need to mature in my life in making sure the full audience, like I already know what you're gonna say, so I'm like, boom, the way we would eat dinner. But meanwhile there's other people listening, like no, no, I wanted Ryan to finish, I thought I'm like, why didn't you understand what the thought was, it was it, you know, like, and so yes, it's listening. It's listening, dude, it's listening, and then what happens is, you, for anybody watching, starting a company, wanting to invest in startup, seed funding, whatever you're doing, it's listening, paying attention. You know, my dad would always say the 11th commandment in the Bible is thou shalt not bullshit thyself. So that's the 11th commandment, don't bullshit yourself, don't, just cause your mom likes it. It's a awareness. Your mom likes it, your girlfriend likes it, cool. We're talking about the world liking it, and I think being real and honest, being your own worst critics, you're not being judged in the court of public opinion, but you're really critically thinking when you put something together. And then I think, like you said, Gary, it's listening and finding that thing, here's one clue from me. If I keep complaining about something, and I'm not a big complainer, I don't like complainers, I don't like people who complain and then don't provide a solution, don't get, my whole team that works with me knows, don't come at me with a problem. If you don't have, you know, and I want you to have- At least a hypothesis of a solution. A hypothesis, don't just go boom and then walk out of the room. So for me, it's like, if I find myself being irritated about the lack of this or I, man, I wish this existed, I wish this thing, whatever, once I do that enough, that's when I feel fine. I go, wait a minute. Is that why you're creating more products these days? I know that, like it feel like every, I feel like every hundred days I get a text from you, like, dude, need to talk to you in a week. I got, and that fires me up. Yeah, I'll give you, I mean, you already know, but I've been in, you know, the CBD water thing. I found CBD as a much needed panacea for stress. I'd gone through a really bad patch in 2017, 16, of just, I'd worked it too hard. I found the wall, I hit it, burned it, it both, pick your analogy, burnt it at both ends. Didn't like Xanax, didn't like wanting to be on drugs at all. Discovered CBD, my high school, guys that I graduated high school with started Charlotte's Web, which is the largest company in the world. They gave me the medical shakedown on it. I fell in love, I'm a true believer, so I got into the space, you know, and I didn't like how it tasted. I didn't, I mean, I'll give you just two quick examples. I didn't like how CBD tasted. I didn't like the medicinal plant flavor. And then I also, at the same time, crush a lot of coffee, don't drink enough water. And I thought, what if you took CBD, everybody's on functional beverages, made it taste good, add it with water, did the whole Tom's shoes give back, you know, one for one, like have a social imperative behind your company, that's another thing. Don't just be a profit monster, have a social imperative. Right, can I ask you something about that, I apologize. How do you think about that? Because I think that there's two ways to do that, right? Like, when empathy came out, you know what I mean, right? So many people in my inner circle debated like, fuck the name, let's do the Tom's shoes, let's do the give back. And I'm like, look, I give back all the time, we're gonna give back. I don't think, you know, sometimes, if it's not fully authentic to your, if you're gonna do it, yeah, there's a caveat to that. If you're going to do it, there are certain brands, like, I mean, to be quite honest, with empathy, I don't know what I would do as a give, that's not, that's a weird one. You know what the cool thing is with that one, with such a broad name, you could have picked anything, because the empathetic, any group of people would have allowed the permission. Yeah, yeah, I mean, where you to start the brand right now, I have a feeling you'd probably find an affiliation. You know what's funny though, I wouldn't, because I feel like right now, and my mind changes all the time. Right now, I feel like those are forced. Yeah. And like, I'm very happy about my give back initiatives. I also am pretty private about my, you know, much like I'm with my personal life, I'm very private with my give back. I've gotten a little louder with like, you know, pens as a promise and chatty water things I'm on the boards of, but, so, and you made it. I think, I think it's, Give a quick plug, because I didn't, I cut it off, because I was curious, I wanted people, I was, I've, we have so many young people listening who are putting businesses together. And I want to make sure that they felt that they didn't have to do the give on back when, you know. You don't have to, it has to be authentic to you. For me, Adele's husband, Simon Konecki, ex-husband, was a friend of mine. He ran a nonprofit called Drop for Drop, which is function, Tom Shoes, and Blake Mykoski is advisor. Blake is super well. Blake is joining the board of Matt Tasey, Walter Robb, a Whole Foods CEO joining the board. How long, how long, how long have you been talking a lot about Matt Tasey over the last three months? We've been around for about a year, there it is. There's the unicorn tears, that's one of the flavors. I'm actually crud, and then I'm actually drinking this one right now, watermelon kiwi. So 20 milligrams CBD, all natural, five calories. And we, we are building our seventh well right now in India, and we're building another one in Malawi. And so what we do is every, you know, we donate 12 ounces of drinking water. So if you buy a can, we donate 12 ounces. What the equivalent is, we build clean water wells, because that is a huge epidemic. I don't think, I mean, charity water has been literally the most, I mean, it's unbelievable when you get educated on how many people around the world don't have fresh water. Dude, it's crazy, people are dying from diarrhea. Kids, like thousands, millions, like it's insane. So this is taking off, we're up, you know, if you have hard numbers, we're up 70% this quarter from last quarter, and 100% from the quarter before. It's taking off, the FDA regulation with CBD is tricky. So let me, let me, let me ask you a quick question that while you were talking, I was trying to let you talk, so I didn't interrupt, but I felt it. I took everything I had to not jump over. I have a question I'm dying to know, and I'm sure it will be a fun story. So you and I are fortunate, we have this intuition of the consumer from a music standpoint. Where have you been crazy off? What record did you hear? And you're like, this, I don't see. Not gonna happen. And then went and slayed America, or artists, not on some guessing shit, I'm like, you sat, you looked, because we've all been there, right? I passed on Airbnb, I passed on Uber, where did you really miss it? I really miss, so every year, there's one or two records that I'm completely off on. Like every year, we saw writers have this conversation all the time, like we pride ourselves in guessing, oh, that's a hit, that's not a hit. Of course, of course, of course. I was wildly off on, and it's the biggest record of this past year by a landslide. I was wildly off on Blinding Lights the weekend. Interesting. And by the way, everybody was. Like everybody, go your own. I love the song, not thrown shade at the weekend. I love Abel. You didn't think the audience was gonna get it? Nobody did, nobody. I mean, it- Why? Was it too complex? It was written by a couple of my friends, like one of the best pop signers of all time, Max Martin, and Abel, because when it came, the first single they dropped didn't connect, it was the fastest fall in the Hot 100 history. Is that true? Yeah, that's true. Which one's the hard one? No, no, no. There was a record. I don't even remember the name of it, but they dropped it. Can you keep going? And I think it was in Carcum- No, then they got Blinding Lights anyway. So this is back at the beginning of the pandemic. Now they dropped it right before the pandemic. So there's only about two or three artists that had momentum going into the pandemic. Those two or three artists maintained and kept that momentum for the last nine months. Dua Lipa, there was a weird chart freezing situation that happened. There was three or four months where I swear to God, the top 10 in Spotify didn't move by more than two songs because they just froze, right? All of you driver's went home, people weren't going through their playlists. It just, everyone's watching the news, they weren't, there wasn't that much chart movement. The weekend got the benefit of that, a handful of records, Dua Lipa got the benefit of that. But the weekend Blinding Lights, I think if you asked Abel himself, did you think it was as big as it is, he would start laughing. I know for a fact the label didn't think that. Nobody, when you're in songwriting sessions, that song gets brought up a lot lately because everyone has the same response. They go, did you see that coming? Nobody saw that coming. And it is the single biggest streaming hit. It will go down, it'll break every single record within the next 90 days streaming records. It's gonna pass Ed Sheeran. What do you think about TikTok's impact on the top? TikTok, so I'm friends with a lot of people who have some massive success in TikTok right now. My friend, Jay Cash, who I spoke with yesterday, wrote Savage Love for Darulo Darulo. I'm very tight with, I just did a record with him a week ago, we're having conversations. His career has been completely rekindled by that platform. Bodies TikTok. You saw TikTok come in, I mean, I believed, from day one I knew that this was gonna be a huge mover. Oh, from a mainstream, he is the Khaled with Snap. Yep, yep, yep. Ashton was Twitter. Can't take it. Move, 24K at golden, right? I'm about to end with that dude, Neon Deore. That record was written with TikTok in mind, right? This is the weirdest, weirdest day. This interview is all time, hold on one second. I just gotta show you this. Synchronicity, synchronicity. What I tell you like. Yo, it was good, Gary, it's 24K golden here. And I got a question for you today, right? Yeah. Is that just so crazy? You and I are very much on the same wave. Not surprised, dude, we're on the same wave. I'm going in with Blake, the whole crew that's part of the New York Golden Crew. Been working with Kid Leroy a bunch. Look, the TikTok thing, in the last, so I did an analysis about six months ago, five months ago, in the top 20, 16 of the top 20 songs had gone off on TikTok. So here's the upside, I'm gonna talk to TikTok for 30 seconds and I'll go off. The upside, the downside, and where I personally think might happen with TikTok. Number one, the upside is it's removed barrier to entry. It's gate crashed, the festival that is streaming and radio and Spotify. And so artists at this point who might not have had a shot like Jouche 685 from New Zealand. He's a 17 year old high school kid in New Zealand and he's gonna make probably five million bucks off Savage Love, that's the truth, probably more. And so everyone's like, oh, I got to write songs. You can't game TikTok and pay the top 10 or 20 people to dance to your record, but ultimately, they have created it in such a way that they actually, if they think a record label is gaming it, they'll kill it. They'll kill that virality. So it truly is a direct reflection of culture. Now, that's the positive thing about TikTok. Here's the negative thing, the best song doesn't win. Historically, my whole career, and I'm quoting two record label executives right now that I've heard in the last month say the same thing. Historically, you could always say no matter what happens or what weird fat is going on, guys, the best song still wins. With TikTok, that's not the case. You have, it isn't so much to do with the record itself. It reminds me of the ringtone moment in the early 2000s when you had Happy Frog and these different songs popping off. It's not about the best song, it is about the dance, the virality, the culture attached to it, all these different. One could argue, I mean, not only could one argue, I can't believe what just happened. I literally had, I've literally heard what you just said before in my life when the original manager of the sticks was talking to me about MTV. Yep. He said what MTV did was ruined it because the best records didn't win anymore. Yeah, I don't think TikTok's ruined it. I think- No, no, just stick with me here because this is a super interesting moment. One could argue what TikTok is right now is what MTV was in the mid-80s that threw the entire thing for a loop, which is when you added the visual element and you added the fact that every teenager was in one place, the best song got redefined because ultimately the only person, not you, not me, not the executives, not the academies, the consumer wins, and if the consumer's attention is in a certain place and there are added variables of the full-pledged artistry, whether that's Charlie D'Amelio, 24 Gold, whatever it is, it is, the market is always right. Yep. You could change the definition, right? What I would say to that is the most consumed song wins, the most engaging song based on visual and or song and or artist wins. Kind of the analogy that someone's saying is, do you think Adele rolling in the deep, right? One of the biggest, most iconic records of the last decade or longer, would rolling in the deep go off in the age of TikTok in 2020? One could argue that the greatest songs that we all know in the 50s and 60s, if they didn't pay the radio disc jockeys to, I would argue that this game has always been the case and that the relationship of distribution and who does or doesn't control it at that moment or how controlled or uncontrolled is it? Yeah. Is a huge variable. You being an entrepreneur, for example, you dropped it very lightly already in here. We've never really talked about this, but this is why I've always desperately admired you from afar. And again, I mentioned it earlier, Aetan Sugarman, a great friend of both of ours, a great, great friend, really was like the person I most, I knew of you, but like just to talk about the quality of who you were. So like, to me, if someone's a nice person and hardworking, like I'm already on third and a half pace with that. But like you talked about earlier about the song and a commercial. Yeah. Your ability to be an entrepreneur, in my opinion, from afar and think about things like a commercial. Yeah. Which is hugely financially valuable and distribution for awareness. Yep. I mean, I always talk about it. I call it the Good Charlotte rule. Good Charlotte on Madden on repeat when people were doing franchise mode in those early days really mattered. I think about distribution all the time. I would argue that Adele's song is remarkable, and was in the right place at the right time for distribution. And that had it been 20 years earlier. I have a funny feeling Adele's song would not win in 1999 TRL land, because she didn't look the part to a lot of people. Yep. You're correct. Timing is everything. So here we go, right? How big in sync was? If you brought out five dudes right now that are American. Five white dudes. Not gonna happen. To America. Five white guys to America right now. Probably not going to be the moment. About the least quavy thing you could do right now is put a five piece white group together. Or maybe the counter move is the other way. And maybe it does. This is what I love about the market. The market being the judgment. I think all that TikTok is doing is getting the same points of view from the establishment that has always happened always. Whether it was Soul Train and Dick Clark and Casey Kasin, whether it was MTV, whether then it was YouTube and whether it was Spotify, whether it's like there will always be a new variable that comes in is more consumer centric. Yes. And then whoever is adaptive to that consumer centricality is gonna win. And then whoever's not is gonna say, this isn't real music. It's 100% is not real. Well, the Duran Duran sucks. That's not, I mean, this is your world. I couldn't even imagine what the real bands of the late 70s and early 80s. Oh my God. I mean, this is why I brought up the stick story because when I found this gentleman in a different meeting, I grilled him for an hour and a half because my thought of what the clash, what fucking, you know, led Zeppelin, and like AC DC thought when Duran Duran and Twisted Sister and Rat took over because they were MTV centric. Yep, yep. You're 100% right. I mean, look, I produced the last two U2 albums. I produced the killers. I work with a lot of bands. I'm working with Bastille right now. It's a weird time in general for bands. It's a weird time for bands. It's a weird time for bands. You know, Coldplay, Biggest Band in the World dropped a double album earlier this year and a lot of people don't even know it happened. And they're one of the biggest bands in the world. I didn't. I didn't. And I'm an enormous fan of their sound. There you go. And I pay attention like a motherfucker. No clue. No clue. I just told you. Now you're gonna go online. There's two albums here. You know what's so funny about zigzagging? It makes me wanna start a band. Yeah. Like to me right now, the opportunity to build like the monster band feels real. Sonically, that's where it's headed. So I can't. What does that mean? The demos, so things happen musically, right? The musical trends come out before, you know, the beauty of what I do or one of the things, things that are reasons I consider myself lucky is I get to hear where the world's gonna be at nine months from now. And it comes, it starts with the song in the studio that's capturing current culture, but talking about other stuff. And you get to hear those records like six to nine months before they come out. So like you can kinda, it's a bit of a Nostradamus lens. I see. And you're saying if you listen, it's kinda like how I felt about tech or what I do with influencers. You're saying, so I'm yelling a lot about men's makeup. Yep. Like I've said for about 18 months now, if I was to start a company from scratch right now, and I had to do it, I couldn't do Vayner anymore in my model, I would start a men's makeup brand. And it's coming because I already see it because I see it broad enough back to New Zealand, e-boys, da-da-da. You're saying because you listen to so many things that are coming, you're like, wait a minute, and then if you're good at this game, oh, look what's happening. From this hip hop artist to this band, to this pop girl, they're all, something's happening here and it's this thing. So to that point, I've heard some demos from some people we've already mentioned on this interview, and from some other huge artists that are in that space, and everything is leaning band. It is going this sonically. I heard a record last week from a guy that just now popping off in LA, like under, like way off of LA, but I think very probably. And it was basically, it was literally Blink 182. I mean, it was like, it was somewhere between Blink 182 and Good Charlotte and like throwing. It's so obvious that that can happen right now. Listen to the instrumentation. Listen to circles post Malone. There's a, there's a forecast. 100%. That's a wave, right? That's a way, that's not just a one-off song. You're going to have whole bands and artists that started because of one song. Circle. Little rapid-fired, underrated. Who's the most underrated artist in your subjective opinion right now? Or if, you know, it's a tough question. Like, or you can do one or two, just who's right now in your opinion, fairly new, just underrated right now. Fairly new, underrated artist? Yeah. Wow, that's a great question. Or they don't even have to be fairly new. Maybe they're actually very big and you were actually like, man, people think this person made it. Wait till they see the next decade of her or his or their potential. Yeah. I mean, that is such a good question. I think that, I think that, I mean, Post is already so big. I'm the, a lot of the artists that I work with are. Let's talk about that. Like Post actually, it's funny. I think I asked the question because you said Post. I actually think Post has the potential to be underrated. Yes. Cause I actually believe that. Yeah, I agree. I, so I would, and anybody that works with him would tell you the same thing. I think Post is underrated. You go, why? He's so big. He's so big. Yeah. He is truly though. Yeah. Beyonce and Drake were so big and were underrated and went on to become bigger. Yep. Yep. Absolutely. Sway Lee. Look, Sway Lee is one of the most freak of nature talents, melody contrivers in the world. The guy can, the guy will come up with melodies and phrases that reminds me of when Tricky in the dream created Rihanna Umbrella. And the first time anyone heard that, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella, like that would, that started a whole wave, right? And Sway Lee has that ability. He has that talent. Sway Lee, if he connects the dots, could be one of the absolute biggest pop artists that are around. Sway Lee, you feel has the ingredients. He just has to cook it. Correct. He has to cook it. Which is hard. By the way, everybody who's listening right now, when I talk about this in sports, in entrepreneurship, in music, in acting, in being a CFO of a company, I have watched in my young, I turned 45 this Saturday, in my young 45 years, I've seen so many people that had every ingredient, but couldn't get out of their ways of insecurity, ego, lack of work ethic, lack of serendipity, tragic end in their family, didn't let them get there. In sports, you see people get hurt. There's different things. And yo, team. So who your team is, it is such a limited group of people that can absolutely displace you or influence you positively in your career. And if you have, if someone in your team isn't firing on all cylinders, they can, whether knowingly or unknowingly, completely sabotage your future with whatever that is. Like a band. Company, yeah, like a band. Dude, you got a bad manager? I went through a handful of managers. Before we landed with the one that I have now, I have the same manager of Pharrell and Usher and a handful of others. He's brilliant, one of the best in the business, Ron Fee. It took me three or four chapters of managers and getting dropped by Columbia Records. I've been dropped twice. It took all that for me to land with the right manager. And I learned the lesson of who your team is, is everything. It's absolutely everything. It's critical. So yeah, I think Swaley's underrated. Taylor Swift, as big as she is, nobody's been in the studio with her. Like they haven't seen what, like I've seen her actual innate ability. Exceeds just about any human being that I've ever seen. She is the best solo writer that's recording music right now. She can sit down and do a whole thing by herself. It's phenomenal. The single greatest musician in the world. Now, I don't know if you consider this person underrated or overrated. I just don't think he's talked about enough. I think he's admired. But the single most impressed I've ever been musically by anyone is Stevie Wonder. He is, there is no one alive, no one alive that is, he is the physical embodiment of music, period. I would argue that he's uncomfortably underrated, uncomfortably. There you go. And I'll tell you why. I, you know, maybe the reason I just asked you this to wrap up, because I got to run, I'm sure you do as well. I did this little, you know, Instagram TikTok show called Overrated Underrated. And I don't know the questions and my team just blurts out stuff. And it's- Yeah, I thought that was what we were doing. Yeah, you know, it's funny. Like, and anyway, I said the Beatles were underrated and the comments exploded. They're like, how is it- Yeah, your herbs are right. I think they are. I don't think, I think, I think most people under 35 struggle to understand it in context as they should. Cause I understand who's going to do the homework. I think Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder was winning at 10. Yeah, winning at 10. At 10. I just want to think about that. I just want to hold on real quick. I apologize for that. 10, most of you have a 10 year old. In your life, yours, your brother, your sister. 10, 10, one of the biggest stars in the world. At 10. Yep. And the only artist to win back to back best album, Grammy's, within a year of each other. He did two albums in a row. One, you know, album of the year, two years in a row. The man is the single most talented musician alive. I've put my name on it, Paul McCartney. I produced his last album. We had our first number one Paul McCartney album in 35 years. And I watched McCartney jump around his studio in England playing every instrument, which by the way, they were the instruments from Sergeant Pepper. He has all of them still there. That's what he uses. And I watched him, I watched him bounce around. I go, Paul, get on the drums. And I hit record. And then he'd do the drum solo. Paul, get on piano. Get on the harpsichord. Fucking amazing. The man is 74 and he bounced around for five days playing everything. It was, it was like, I mean, that's the, you know. You know what, Brian? I'm going to end with that. How old are you? I'm 41. Great. Brian's 41. I turned 45, like I said, on November 14th, depending on when you're listening to this, Paul McCartney 74, still doing it. When you find what you do, what you love, when you're at it for all you 20 fucking year olds that listen to this shit and get mad at me when I talk about patience, it's early. What were you doing when you were 22 years old? When I was 22 years old, I was living in Nashville, writing songs, signed to Timbaland, trying, absolutely broke. I was broke until I was 20, 26, absolutely flat broke. By the way, for everybody to understand this, one of the great talents that of course there's going to be people in their 20s like Ryan that get there. I'll use myself at 26. I didn't have fun, anything about anything about anything other than I was building a liquor store for my dad's business. Like I was building a business for him. So I think that patience matters. And when I hear the 74 year old story of McCartney, like that fucking fires me up. This was a lot of fun, Ryan, I love you. I wish you love it. Thank you Gary. Thank you Seth for producing, we'll talk soon. Bye everyone, leave some comments. YouTube, watch it, what's up, it's Gary Vee. First of all, thank you so much.
