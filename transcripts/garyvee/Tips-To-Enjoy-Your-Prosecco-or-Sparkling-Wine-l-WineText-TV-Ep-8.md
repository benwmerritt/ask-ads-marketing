Don't open, I'm just... it's sparkling wine if you know how to do it. You'll... I kind of know how to do it. Okay. Show me. Ah! The secret. The secret is... Palette's remarkable. Champagne is made for... Before we start, this is for Matthew Davis. That comment is... stop zooming in so much. Okay, you can start now. You got a lot of joy out of that. I'm planning it for a week. Look how happy you are. You're gonna try to do a better job on the camera than it does? Hello everybody, welcome to episode 8 of WineText TV. WineText.com, the number one way to buy wine in America, super premium wines, discounted heavily. I'm here with my best bud, Brandon Warnickie again, who was missing last episode, right? Most views on an episode, maybe there's a combination. For sure. We have a really fun episode for you. Prosecco has become a dominant category of wine purchasing in the U.S. almost 700 million bottles of Prosecco sold last year. Let's get into it. What do we got here first, Brynn? This is the Kaffer Lan. I think it says Kubei. $13 suggested retail price. 92 points vine pair, 86 points wine enthusiast. This is pretty popular stuff, yes? 100%. This is one of our biggest selling Prosecco's in the shop. Let's give this a snippy sniff. On the nose, I'm getting a little baked apple, a little white chalk. I don't know if any of you were rascals in your classrooms like I was, but I would get the class early, get the two erasers, put them together and create a cloud for no good reason. That was me. That was you? It's got a hint of that when you said that. Remember that smell? That's exactly what I'm getting here. A little baked apple, almost like not even baked apple, almost like, do you remember McDonald's apple pie? Almost the best. Basically, if you went to McDonald's during lunch because you went to one of those kind of high schools and opened the baked apple pie walking into class and one of your buddies was a rascal and did that and you walked through it, that combination of scent is what this wine smells like. Let's give it a whirl. Full disclosure, every one of these wines is probably going to get rated one or two points higher than it should because fun fact, sparkling wine is probably my favorite category. If you told me I can only drink a red, a white, a sparkling wine, a dessert wine, a rosé, an orange wine, I would probably pick a sparkling wine. It is that much of my favorite. I believe sparkling wines are misunderstood. Finally, because of things like prosecco, people drink sparkling wine all the time, but we used to really keep it for important toasts, graduations, weddings. I believe for a lot of you that lean towards and enjoy sparkling wine, please don't be embarrassed to use it as a white wine or rosé substitute by the pool with a salad. Casual as an aperitif when you have guests over. Sparkling wine should be a bigger part of the rotation and prosecco is a remarkable price point for it. This has a hint of sweetness, almost like cereal flavor to it that I like a lot. Apple continues through the palette. It is a little hollow and it is a little bit basic, but listen, it's $9.88. I think the wine enthusiast has this pegged right. To me, this is an 86 point prosecco and more than five. Nobody is going to be upset about drinking this for $10, $13. You start getting above that if you go to a local store and they have high prices. 13 feels capped out to me. There's too many other things you can find at that price point, but just very inexpensive. Again, 86 points is not a humongous score, but not bad. What do we got here? Zardetto. Wow, what a different label than when I grew up. When I was in the game, this was not the bottle. Prosecco 90 points, James Suckling, $16 suggested retail. Looks like wine library is around 12. This might be one of the first ones that we had. I think back, this was one of the original ones for sure. This was a monster for us. We sold a boatload of Zardetto Prosecco to your point in probably the early 2000s, 2001, 2003, 2004. What's crazy is back then it was the same price range. Things have not gone up that much. Do any of you remember what Mr. Bubble's bubble bath smelled like? I should have. What are they all about? I don't know. It's here again. It's here again. God, I get that smell. This smells like cheap potpourri in a dollar store. It smells like a dorm room. I use that analogy a lot. It's fake nice. Like shampoo. Like soapy. It's soapy. Let's give it a whirl. So less sweet than the prior wine. But pretty boring. This is actually incredibly basic. The Zardetto is a pass for me. I'm going to go 84 points on it. I think it's hollow. I don't think it has, you know, ironically, it's less delicious than the first wine in some ways. It's a little more complex. It's like probably a slightly better made wine. But I really do think in terms of this way, if a hundred of you tasted this wine and you had to pick one or the other, I do think more people would pick the first wine over the Zardetto. And so, and for my own palate, I'm not really in love with it. I'm going to go 84 points. It's a pass. Okay. What do we got here, Brandon? I know you got excited about some of the homework you did on this one. So the next two are definitely higher end Prosecco. I think this one, Isimo, right? Yep. And you'll notice, I don't think it says it on the front, but on the back, it should say Valdo Bia Danae. That is one of these specific areas, I should say, for high quality Prosecco. Kind of the heartland where it all started. And the best quality Prosecco oftentimes can come from this area. Can you zoom in here? These two both show it on the back. If you see this, we'll put it in the copy. So this comes from a specific region within. So it'd be like New York State is Prosecco, Manhattan is where this was made. And so you can see like just like real estate, real estate in Manhattan is more expensive than in Yonkers. This is a more premium area of making this Prosecco. And I think it's the only DOCG. The others are DOC. Suggested retail $25. This starts getting to premium stuff. This was a monster on Wine Text. This is one of the first wines we've had on the show that actually was on Wine Text. Like offered on Wine Text. Oh, I think you're right. Yeah. So that's cool. This is a little meta. This wine made a big, big statement on Wine Text. Sign up for Wine Text because Sasha will be happy. All right, let's get a sniffy snip. I'm not happy. I'm excited about it. Already it's more exciting. A little peach fuzz, a little cantaloupe. So this is much more exotic already coming with a much stronger scent. Makes sense. This is a more premium area. So makes sense that aromatically it's stronger. You can sense there's something going on here. This is really well made. You know what I really love about this wine? There's a little tiny hint of hazelnut shell and little hazelnutty thing on the finish that really, really takes this up a notch. Do you like it? I loved it. All right. Last wine. Follador. Suggested retail $45. Ranges between $35 and $50 worth $34.99. Talk to me about this, Bryn. So this is arguably one of the most iconic producers in the area for sure. Interesting. This is really good. The nose is remarkable. Beautiful white flower. I get a little bit of like melon more than not watermelon, like melon, like not cantaloupe even. What am I looking for? Thank you. Very good work. Honeydew, white flower. The palette's remarkable. I could be very faked out by this wine. I'm a little rusty in comparison to where I was 15 years ago in tasting, in a blind tasting of someone's like, this is $60 champagne. I'm like, okay, like I could absolutely be fooled. I'm going to give the Isimo a 92 point score. I'm going to give this 94 points. This is remarkable. This is really not eye-opening. It's affirming to what I know about what's going on in Prosecco. What a wonderful alternative to champagne for 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, $15 a bottle. There's a lot of hitting and missing in that category. When you start getting a little bit more strategic and you go 12 to 20, this is $16.99, it gets really good. Like really good. This is really good. If you're a real sparkling wine nerd and you've gone through all the grower champagnes in France, you know who Terry Thies is, who's one of the great importers. You're a nerd. You haven't given the respect because Prosecco's normally low-cost and you haven't gone to the super premium. Do yourself a favor and explore it because these two wines rival many of the grower champagnes that I admire at more attractive price points. That's the point of the show. You really want to make sure that you're learning. Most of all, I want you to make sure you're acting on it. Me doing a show about why push-ups and eating healthy is good is great, but you acting on it is even better. Me doing a show about wines and getting people excited or educated about certain things like we just did here, you going out this weekend and purposely picking up a $12 and a $20 Prosecco to really learn and taste the difference, especially if you only drink white and rosé and want to push yourself to see the alternative of bubbles or especially if you just buy Vue Clico and Tatt&Jay and just like the supermarket premium $50 Champagnes, you need to explore sparkling wines from the rest of the world. How do you properly open this thing? Angles. Most people. Is it with air in it? Angles. Because the angle you pull it from, if you go straight up, it just shoots. With the angle, it gives a little room. I'm Gary Vee and this is Wine Text TV.
