AI voice translation in every language will be a full default thing in every social media platform within the next half decade. Everything is about to be translated. Every one of these social media platforms is gonna translate all of our videos. Anybody who wins as a standalone AI voice product is gonna either get destroyed or get a purchase by the biggest companies in the world. Attention is the number one asset. Bill, it's good to see you, bro. What's up, man? Good to see you. How you been? I got a FaceTime fleet with you, so I'll make this short. I get enough time. What's that, your brother-in-law? That's what I'm meeting with? Was it your brother-in-law? Oh man, he doesn't forget. Tell Clix again, he don't forget. You remember when we were, my honeymoon in Japan, you remember all this stuff. Dude, I fucking listen, care. Don't let him celebrate. What are you talking about? It's really not, it's, you know, when you listen and you care and like, I appreciate it. Anyway, let's get to your question. I'll make a quick, yeah, I get enough time with you. You're awesome. Thanks for, I mean, you're beasting through this. Thank you. I mean, my question today was more on kind of credibility versus consistency. Whether it's me or anyone else starting out new podcast, you know, this is me in like 10 years when I stopped doing what I'm doing, which I actually kind of love. You start a new podcast, would you rather be credible or consistency? I'd rather be consistent because consistent is something I can control. Credible isn't something I can control. Outside people do that. Like when you started, you know, doing your wine videos, I mean, you weren't a small yay, right? You just liked wine, right? No, I was running the largest e-commerce independent wine retail business in the country. Right. So I had credibility of like, and I like, you can't watch that show and not realize like this guy knows what he's talking about. Like you can't, like, I can't do that show about Pokemon cards. Yeah. Like you have to know. Yeah. So. And there was like, you know, videos when you first started, you were, it was that big? Yeah, I'd had already been running the business for quite a long time. You had the credibility and then obviously the consistency's been. Yeah, but there's plenty of people that. After Wine Library TV exploded in 2007, every single sommelier and every wine store in the country started doing wine videos. Yeah. People thought wine videos were viral. They didn't realize I was viral. And so like, plenty of those people had much bigger credibility as me, Master Soms, this and that, and 100% of them failed. Yeah. And the person that was most consistent, my friend, Andre Mack, Mutant Noir, great sommelier per se, he grinded for a decade and now he has a real platform. Consistency is controllable. Credibility is not. Yeah. Awesome. Super cool. Love you, bro. Talk soon. And I hope I'll see you soon with my cousin in New York. Can't wait. Hey, Gary. Can you hear me fine? Perfect. Awesome. Honestly, thank you for doing this show. I really appreciate it. I just really wanted to thank you for everything you've done first and foremost. Can I honestly say that you're my hero. You really changed my life for everything that you've done. Kind of wanted to give you more context about me and kind of like my life. I'm 20. I go to FIU in Miami, Florida. And I'm graduating this December. I'm so excited. Can't wait to go out there and kill it in the world. But I used to work at a golf course, right? Draming golf when I was 17, 18. And through just listening to music, I got bored of it. And I started listening kind of to your shows, to your YouTube videos. And that just really sparked my entrepreneurship, my marketing, my sales in me. And I haven't looked back since. And I kind of started helping students with college admissions process, because that's where I was at the moment. Been down and graduating and getting a degree. And I've gotten really deep into marketing and everything. I've really fallen in love with personal branding, specifically on LinkedIn. After you hammered us on it for years and years, I finally got in it a couple of months ago. And I went full on. I took a whole bunch of courses on how to copyright, how to do everything. And it's been four months. And I've gotten 4,000 followers. And I get at least two to three DMs every single day on students that want to learn how to do personal branding, specifically on LinkedIn. Go, Sing. That kind of motivated me to start a whole video course on how to do the whole thing, on how to do LinkedIn branding specifically for college students, teaching them the whole start process the foundations of LinkedIn, how to grow on LinkedIn, how to do content creation, how to get internships, because a lot of students simply don't know when they're not being taught that. And it's been launched on May 1st. So pretty much my question is scary. How can I promote that as well? I'm particularly making the content on LinkedIn. But I know there's TikTok YouTube. I have a YouTube account. I have TikTok. I have Instagram. I have all that. But how can I have a good successful launch? Bro, you know the answer to the question. It's how you got into the opportunity to even do this in the first place. You have to be good at organic social media content. And if you've got a couple of dollars to your name, you need to be good at paid media on social. Social is underpriced attention when you're good. Yeah, and I've definitely used that. And I've have right now 35 students on the waiting list that have signed up and gone. Right? And I'm really excited about that. But it's just like kind of the tactics behind that. I don't know if you have any ideas for example. I know it's going to be one of the number one things there. How do you think I can make a video that would really hit it off? Well, the first second of the video has to pop. The thumbnail has to say, are you having troubles with school admission? Then you start the video with like, I can help you. So now you banged it with context and hook. And then you give them steak behind that real tangible shit. Write good copy. Post it. It fails. Do the same thing in a different version. Boom, boom, boom. Just testing, testing, testing. Not testing. Executing with observing the information. Meaning every attempt is not a test. Every attempt is to win. And then when it doesn't win, because most don't, analyzing what might or might not have won. Right. I get you. And really the long term process that I have for this is that not only do I want to teach how beautiful LinkedIn is, because again, 1% of everyone that is on LinkedIn, of the billion users only create content on it. Only 1%. And even then, 91% of college students that come in into college don't even have a LinkedIn profile. So there's a lot of people that I can serve. But should I serve this into professionals as well? People that are in corporate America, or people that are just entrepreneurs and just don't know everything that has LinkedIn to offer? What do you think? It's one of the most underpriced platforms in the world right now. And well, that's one thing. I don't know if this is a false belief, right? But me being 20, right? With my experience only being in college, how can I overcome that and really give those tangible things? Is it more a case study, testimonials, or social proof of the work that I've done for students that I can show that to professionals as well? By having those people post about you once you've done it. OK. Yeah. No, that makes sense. Yeah, these are just questions that I think. No, no, here I'm jumping in for the audience. Like, I know people ask this all the time. But like, you'll have more testimonials when you're 22 than when you're 20. Yeah. No, it just takes time, eventually, just getting more and more. Just own your skills. OK. Just really own the skills and know the skills. Own skills and talk about the skills. Execute, talk. Execute, talk. Execute, talk. Execute, talk. Awesome. The other question that I did have for you, I mean, this is more on the personal side. Again, this is my business. This is my baby, and I love doing it. What experience should I be getting after I graduate? Right now, I work for an HR Imperial company. Their name is UKG. They've treated me great. I'm working in sales for them. But I want to see how a job getting work and experience under someone will play me really good to eventually go in full on my own thing. What endeavor do you think I should go into? I just want to get ideas. I know I can go for them and work on this business on the side. But what do you think? What do you want to learn? I want to be the best person in digital marketing and branding that has ever been coming out of Miami, out of coming from Columbia. I want to become that person. Then go and do it. Meaning go do that work. Work at a marketing agency. OK. Or go work for someone and do the marketing for them. Being the best at it can only be done by being an actual practitioner. Just doing it every single day? Yes, like I've been doing for the last 20 years. Absolutely. No, yeah. No, it really means a lot. No, I appreciate it. And I really thank you for everything you've done, Gary. You don't understand. I mean, I have my other partner here who is with me. Come on and say hi. But we've listened to you since you know, we've been. What's your name? His name is Alejandro. Alejandro. How are you, bro? Good. Great seeing you guys. Yeah. No, yeah. It's a pleasure. And you don't know how many people you're inspiring, just so you can know at the college level or age. You're crazy down here in Miami. So I'm happy for the event that you guys are going. Hopefully we'll be able to go to V-Friends and everything. We're going. Yeah, we're going. We're going. We're going. You should absolutely go. All right, brother. Love you. See you. Let's keep it going. Daniel. Hi. Good to see you. Great to see you, bro. How are you doing? Fantastic. Good night in the middle of the night out of London, UK. It's great to see you. What are you guys? Is it 11.53? Yes, it is. Very nice. Well, thank you for being here. Thank you for having this opportunity. I was not expecting this. It's good to see you. So I have a question. And I'm sure the book at all is the answer. But maybe you can give me a snapshot before. And I'm working as a coach. And this industry is full of 90% of people who shouldn't do it. And it's overloaded with people and less and less authenticity and not helping people. And how would you position yourself starting going out? Because everything I did so far was just without any social media, without any marketing. Just we did everything without just from mouth to mouth. And it worked. But I know to get the size I want to get, it's super important and to become the next kind of biggest speaker in the world. It's needed to be out there in the internet. How would you position yourself so disruptive? It's not focusing on bringing people value. Like what we're doing here right now. Yeah, that's what we do. You're starting at zero. That's OK. That's fun. It's part of the journey. But you have things to say and you have value to bring. And slowly but surely you put out video. You start a podcast. You interview people. You cut the clips. You put it on social. Or you just put things on social. You go live. You're living in a huge opportunity world. One good comment, consistency around content, just pound it. It's there. I think you know the steps. How to be good at it. How to be good at it. First of all, it's the depth of your knowledge. So it sounds like you've been able to build. It sounds like you're good at your job. Because if you're winning on word of mouth and you're not doing any marketing on the internet, it means you're actually good at your job. So that should be very easy for you to be successful in this. Because you'll talk about things you know. The reason things have worked for me is I talk about business and marketing. And I talk about wine. I talk about the jets and collectibles. I talk about things I know. You know what I mean? Yeah, sure. That's what you need to focus on. Yeah, it's more the question about the niche. Because right now I'm doing everything like company workshops, do one-on-one coachings, doing relationship workshops, doing kind of family consolation work overall with it. But if you go out there with everything and just I'm out there with everything. Would you start doing out there with everything from the beginning? No. Because everybody else has started with a niche, expand, be an expert, expand it. I did. And that's a good call out. But I would say that we've seen plenty of people. Look, everything you just talked about is the same shit. It's 100% right there. OK, so you're not. It's not like you're doing barbecue chicken videos and skiing videos and Manchester United videos. And then this. You're staying in the same general genre. You're just double clicking into relationship graphs. I think your niche is that, the whole thing. You're just so deep in your craft that you know it's niched out underneath. But the normal people, it's just. OK, got it. Got it? Yeah, OK. Because you think like the person of the development overall is still a niche and then inside of it. The first thing that people are going to learn in this book, and if they're paying attention, is content now finds people. OK. So unlike back in the day when you were building a profile, and then like, you know, now content finds people. When I make a garage sale video, it's going to find people that are around garage, boot sales, as you know them. Those videos are going to find those people. When I talk about marketing, it's going to find those. The algorithms are getting so smart. Like, you can do anything about anything. And it's going to find its place. OK, nice. And then maybe just the last question. I'm originally coming from Germany. I just recently moved to London and exited the old business last year and going fully into the coaching was also kind of a step going international, doing it in English. But sometimes it feels like leaving behind the people in Germany and not speaking German. Would you use like the AI technology to hold German videos? Good. You already got it. Not a sudden, everything is about to be translated. And everyone, like, what do you think is about to happen? Every one of these social media platforms is going to translate all of our videos as a deal. Anybody who wins as a standalone AI voice product is going to either get destroyed or get a purchase by the biggest companies in the world. AI voice translation in every language will be a full default thing in every social media platform within the next half decade. It's a feature. OK, nice. Can't wait to clip that shit in three years. When I'm like, meta, announcements, you can already feel the clip on that one, right? You all, yeah, I saw all of you. I was like, I know you all think that's why I said that loud. Go ahead, Dan. What's the one thing you would devote yourself to in my position because it's right now, it's not the marketing thing. I'm good at the work, but I'm not good at the marketing thing. This is like a new language for me. Education. Free education. Right, like getting educated. Devote yourself to at least even knowing. Like, I know that all the AI algorithms for social media now are interest-based, so I can sit here and say the content will find everybody. It's not like that's some great secret. If you spent 10 hours reading and watching videos and listening to marketing, you would learn that. So I would devote myself to trying to figure out who the best people to listen to are and go out there and kind of attack it. That's how I came here. Well, I'm very humbled by that. And there's others putting out good stuff and just Googling, just chat, TPT-ing, searching, typing, enter, and you'll find your way, brother. And then, as you know, you can't read about doing push-ups. At some point, you gotta start doing the push-ups. 100%. Then start building a team or doing it first on your own and then enter. I've been doing this a long time. I'm very confident in you. I can smell it through the screen. You're just in the beginning of the journey, just gotta put in the work and you'll be, I have a funny feeling it's gonna go very well. Okay, thank you so much, man. You're welcome, brother. Take care. Gary Vee, baby, in the house. Family. How you doing? Great. Oh, man. I hope you're hydrated, bro. You're just on like a QVC marathon right now. I'm feeling good. I love it, bro. I love it. Hey, thanks for taking time. Most importantly, you know I'm gonna show up with the company logo and stuff because you give this awesome opportunity to us entrepreneurs, bro. I felt so touched by Connor, the guy you had on earlier, the kid that was 17. Man, that was my story, bro. I was 18 years old, a senior in high school, was gonna be a chemical engineer, turned down eight football scholarships and start a mowing grass. My chemistry teacher, my guidance counselor was like, you're crazy, what are you gonna do? You just gonna go grass for the rest of your life? I was like, no, I'm gonna build a business. And they couldn't see it. And so I just love, man, that you helped so many young entrepreneurs believe in themselves when a lot of people don't. And that's where it starts at. But man, I appreciate you having me on for a couple of seconds. I got a quick question for you. I've been following you a long time. Started back in 2016. I actually ran my first Facebook ads two weeks after it opened in 2013. Started a business in 2016, fought a lot of your stuff and been trying to preach the gospel that social media is not a fad. I worked with agents, real estate agents and insurance agents. And dude, even to this day, I'm still getting pushback that they're like, oh, I don't have time to do it or I don't see the value in doing it. And I'm like beating my head against the wall. I saw this opportunity. I'm like, yo, let me let G spit some game to these guys and clip this shit so that they can hear it. Straight. Bro, I'll be honest. Bro, I think you've got the wrong framework. Don't, don't get caught up in this. It's very simple. Don't be convincing. Just have conviction. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I try, but a lot of times it's like, they'll get on board with us. They'll get on our service. We'll coach them. They'll be making content. They'll do it for a month or two. And they're like most people on social media, right? They do a month or two worth of content and then they fizzle out. And I try to tell them that branding is a big boy game. It's a long-term game. It's not, Doritos doesn't spend $7 million on a Super Bowl ad and then come in the next morning and say, how many bags of chips did we sell last night? It's a bigger piece. So like, can you just talk to those people right now that like are still on the fence with social media about that? Honestly, bro, I'm not, I'm very, very not passionate about convincing people that in 2020 fucking four have a debate about social media. It's bad, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, I just don't have any, I don't have any energy for it. Like, I'll just let them deal with the consequences of their non-action. Yeah. And the next generation is gonna fill in on the backside. We always say that the insurance industry has PMS. It's Pell, Mel and Stale. And like these guys, if they don't get on the bandwagon that the kids that are coming up behind them, that's how they're gonna, they're gonna eventually take their books of business. As it should happen, whoever's better. Amen, brother. Whoever's better. Americanocracy, right? 100%. I love it, man. If I can ask you one more question from a dad standpoint, cause it's all new to me. Right now, like, having Willow, I'm like more energized and like motivated than ever to just go fucking dominate and put my competitors out of business. I get a lot of shit from that in the marketplace cause people are like, you're being too loud and preposious about that. But at the same time, like, dude, I just wanna spend time with my family. Like, I have, I've never had that. I used to be able to just grind and now it's like, ugh. It's great. It's wonderful. Like, bro, like, it's the best. If you're asking me how to balance, there is no balance. You do the best you can. Sometimes you're gonna pick the grind and sometimes you're gonna pick the family and it's all gonna end up awesome in the end cause you have good intent and you're gonna try to make it awesome. Yeah, man. Just trying to build an empire for them, you know? Yeah, I mean, but you're really building it for yourself. You enjoy the process. Yeah, fuck yeah, I love this stuff, dude. I woulda went to college otherwise, you know? That's the course of it. You know what I mean? Parties and girls I didn't get to take advantage of because I was grinding and mowing grass. You know what I mean? Well, all my friends were like, hey, bro, you coming? You coming to this party on Friday? I'm like, I can't. I gotta work tomorrow morning, bro. You know, like you did in the Wine Library, you know, the Wine Store days. And look at your fucking face and you were a football player, you fucking had it, bro. You fucking, you just chose your other love. I get it. Yeah, man. I think you just called me chunky. I said handsome. Oh, okay, okay. I'm with you. I appreciate it. I will, DJ. Thank you so much, brother. Appreciate you, man. Bye-bye. Hi, Maddie. I can't believe I'm on a live stream right now. It's like five to one in the morning in the UK. I've been a fan for so long because it's amazing I'm getting to chat to you. A quick question for musicians. So I've been a musician all my life, right? My own music, but mostly as a session musician, which is like we go and as a bass guitarist or guitarist or drummer or whatever, we go and play with other artists on their own stuff, could be live, could be in the studio. And I finally at the point where I can really focus on creating content and everything around music, but I'm finding that as you know, all the copyright issues when it comes to putting your own music on platforms is a big problem. I can't think of the amount of videos I've posted of me playing on a song. And then it's been wiped for copyright because you're doing covers of people's songs or you get flagged for even doing original stuff sometimes because it just doesn't recognize you. Yeah, because it doesn't recognize, yep. Yeah, so I just wonder, because I'd love to start doing like TikTok lives and doing Twitch lives and more YouTube live stuff. So is there any advice you'd have for someone who would like to do more music stuff, but not necessarily get flagged for copyright? Is there any other platforms have the leverage? There's obviously other platforms, different live streaming, different social networks that might be less advanced in their copyright. So there's that, but then also comma original music. Okay, so if we were putting out... The record labels aren't interested in you using something they own as a foundation for you to build. It's just the way they see it. Yeah, so it's like for just getting just more exposure just as like a bass guitarist or just musician in general, a big way of doing that is by putting you, doing covers of people's songs and stuff. I'm very aware. The problem is the record labels don't give a fuck about what you want. Yeah, it's... So is there any... So if I'm like to build a brand around music and not just being a musician, but just music in general, because I'm also, I've started like dealing in final, like record finals, is there any kind of content that you think would be good to put out that isn't necessarily playing music itself, but around that, like if I was to go on... There's music, there's the business of music. There's the storytelling around music. And look, there's ways to do covers on live that might not shut down. Like there's also the arbitrage of like just doing it and like letting it go down, like doing it and watching it come down. Again, meaning if the covers are taken down, they're taken down. Like there's a little bit of that, you know? Yeah. It's like trying to find the right way to do it. Cause I see a lot of people doing covers and then they don't get taken down, but... Isn't there like music performance licenses? Like I don't know how the platforms play with that. Yeah, and I don't know if it's different in the UK and the US. It's different between platforms as well. It's like I've had stuff taken down on one platform or not. No, the truth is... The music stuff is so like, like discouraging from a creative and entrepreneurial standpoint that I don't tend to go super hardcore, you know? It's really tough because especially in like the blues and jazz world, which is like my kind of thing. A lot of it is just improvising with people and a big thing is just, you know, capturing that live and posting that. But then you try and record something live when it's just like a random jam. It's gonna sound terrible unless you've done all that. But I think the random jam sounding temperate ball with you giving context as an overlay of like, this is what jam life is, could be very high value content. Okay, so like a commentary on why... It sounding terrible. I mean, I mean like the technical side of it because you can't, you know, mic everything up and everything. Yeah, I was thinking of baby go and down that route, but it's like... Isn't there a good amount of public domain content, right? Is there? Public domain. Like there might be, you know, like just things that eventually switched over into public domain versus copyright. Oh yeah. Yeah, there's really OGC. And when you do it like improvise jam stuff live, I mean, that's all made up on the spot. You know, there's no copyright issues there. There's also the ability to maybe do remixes and duets off of stuff that's been up with that. Like there might be a little bit of play on that. Yeah, so I was wanting to be able to do, like I do have the time to maybe like, because I work for my house and it's like, just stick a camera up and go on Twitch for a bunch of hours a day. But I'm like, should I just post hours of base practicing? I don't know. You should try. You should definitely try for sure. Cool, I'll give it a go. Right. Amazing. The best night. Thank you so much, man. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Gary. How about a wee intro? How are you? You're looking great after 10 hours of live streaming, gotta give it to you. Thank you, man. I thought it was actually pretty funny. So this is a post from 2017 on my Facebook and you can't see it. I actually didn't know. I just checked it. It says you have to go 100%. It can be half pregnant. Yep. This will be very ironic considering my question. So I've been following you for a long time, really benefited me in 2020 when I started my TikTok channel. So you can see I'm into cars. So I love talking about cars and that's what I did. And that really helped at a nine to five in a car corporation. And well, my channel grew pretty quick to 200K on TikTok, which was a good momentum. Very good. But then stagnated and we had sort of a dilemma where I realized that I'm not spending enough time on my passion on TikTok and social media brand. So my question is, so I need to, in order to become better and more successful than this and actually make it full time, I need to commit to more hours. But it's a chicken and neck problem where I'm not earning enough to do that from this and I need to support a family. I have two-year-old, love them, amazing. Shout out Kelly and Anzo. So my question is, how can I monetize this? I'm in Canada, Toronto, and I'm only relying on brand deals at the moment. They are, okay, I'm reinvesting all the money I'm making to better equipment and stuff. You need more audience to make those deals bigger. And then you need an audience that's compelled and connected to you if you wanna do other things like merch or other things of that nature. So... Mm-hmm. And just as simple as putting in more hours, right? Trying to squeeze in the very last second. You know this, it's like, how do I get stronger? You put in the reps and work, like, you know, I mean, the thing you could do is clearly reach out to brands more aggressively, right? So you can lean in by reaching out to brands that you think you can do, but like, you know, like, there's the cliche things like merch and things of that nature, you just wanna keep, like, what you got affected by was back to underprice, back to trading attention. TikTok was underpriced attention, so grew quicker because it was supply and demand. A lot of you are going through the learning I did back in the day 15 years ago, which is like, oh shit, you gotta hit these things hard when they're underpriced, because once they become properly priced, you have a lot of regret that you didn't go harder. I promise you, I know that you regret not going harder now that you can't get it done, right? Although I did go pretty hard, so I'm happy about that, but there's always more. Yeah, exactly, but I'm pumped about that. I'm glad you've left it on the field. There's always more, but if you feel like you really went at it, then that's good. You really went at it. Yeah, it's been a few years first here for sure. Like, all in, I got fired from my job because of my TikTok channel, which is pretty funny. Why, they didn't understand? Oh, I did a campaign for a non-competing brand, like a brand deal, and they just didn't like it and fired me on the spot. No explanation, nothing, which is okay. That's fine. Trust me, they're lost. Right, well, I really appreciate your time and all the effort you put into this and your advice. I'm looking forward to the book. Enzo will appreciate your new kid's book and I will appreciate the day trading attention. I love you. Thank you very much. Take care, man. What's good, bro? What's going on? I've been here all day with you. Been watching you since the morning. I've been seeing your comments, my guy. Telling my bad. I was just trying to get on. What's good? Hey, just want to say I appreciate you. I've been watching you for like the last five, six years. So there's a little backstory about little, about two and a half years ago. I worked at Pepsi. I would make the soda. They paid me good. I had a house. This is me and my son. Then he was about like two, three years old, but I just hated the job. The management wise, it was just horrible, kind of working there. Okay. And I worked Gregor shift and so on Instagram and your video popped up, the video used the analogy of friends. People hate their jobs and they go home and they use that content to escape instead of making content. And I just connected with me cause I'm a big football fan. I just, I watched the games, highlights, podcasts, all the shows. I go on YouTube and so I was like, you know, I'm gonna make a page. So I made the page. I didn't really think anything of it. I just love football. So I just started making content. The first, the first season I made the page, I was only on Instagram and it was kind of like slow interactions here and there, nothing big. And then that month of the playoffs in January, I went to TikTok. I was like, let me try TikTok. And it was just way better than the whole season on Instagram. And that's when I started learning how you say about social media, learn your content, your platforms. And it just, everything went off on, on TikTok. My first mini viral video was with my son. I had like the filters on his head and he kind of guessed that the team names, he didn't know any of them, but it was just, it exploded like ESPN shared it and all that stuff. And it kind of just started connecting with me, like, you know, this could lead to something. I ended up leaving Pepsi. I sold my house. It was just, I knew it was time for a change. And so when I did that, all that stress of working at a job I didn't like for paying for bills, a house that I like, I really didn't need or just me and my son. So all that stress was finally gone and left. I'm at a better job now to actually appreciate my future employees. And I have a set schedule to where I have time with my son and I'm able to focus on my page. And so this year, in the beginning of the season, I posted, it was like a 10 second video of the players doing the dances called the squabble. And it was like a 10 second video and for some reason it exploded. It got like 45 million. And I got over 10,000 followers just for that video. And so now this is my first off season where I'm able to focus on my page and kind of, I have all these ideas and kind of watching your feed from this morning, you kind of answered it, just do everything. There's no or it's always and. And so that was kind of my question was like, when I go on TikTok live, I don't really care about the viewers, but just myself, I get kind of awkward. So I was, I've been thinking about like, bring you someone else to bounce ideas off of, kind of bounce the energy off of, because that's how I am. Or kind of like reaching out to other pages, kind of collabing on certain videos. Both of those things would work, Jess. Yeah. So those are the ideas I had. I like to incorporate some of my son and some of them, cause he's six now and he loves football. So he gets into it. It's like me, we watch the games together. So just, I guess since I know my page is just a baby, two years old, kind of, how do I grow from here? Kind of, I know posting content, which I'm doing, but like other. I mean, commenting. So one of the things you can do, Jess, with your pages, go to other football and sports content and comment something that's additive, whether it's funny or informational, you've been seeing that, right? You know, TikTok. So commenting as creative, I think is a huge opportunity. So I think that's the other big move you can do, other than what you brought up. Okay. Yeah. And something that I was thinking about, cause I really love music, like all genres. Cause I used to do music before I had my son, was like incorporating music, like, find like local artists and kind of doing like lives with them or some that may, they do music, but their side hobbies like football, we can talk football. They can do that. So those were just some. Every, bro, Jess, every idea you have, make it. Yeah. That's, yeah. Cause that was my question. Like I said, watching from the beginning of your feeds. How you always say and and not or. The biggest thing I learned was to answer my question. So. Good brother. Well, thanks for hanging with us all day, brother. All right, brother. Have a good day. Brian. How we doing? It's good to see you. You too, man. Hey, thanks for bringing me on. I got four books pre-ordered, three for my kids and one for somebody on my team that has had their first baby last week. So I'm pretty pumped to give it to them. I'm so happy brother. The question I asked on there is still relevant and what I wanted to ask. I run a small advertising agency. We're in rural South Dakota. Started January 1st, 2020. What a time to start an agency. I thrive and I want to help local businesses grow. So when I say local, especially here, they're very small businesses. Very. With small budgets most of the time too, unless I can show the growth and whatever. My question is, how can I best portray that story to really get my point across if I want these people to win? By delivering on that over time and building that reputation. And just keeping it authentic. Yeah, I mean, to your point, like they, you know, small businesses have very limited budgets, small towns. Like you already know, you know what it is. They're cynical to it, but they're open to it. Like, and you're from it. It's not like I'm coming in from New York. So they're gonna believe you a little more than me. I think you've just got to attack it, you know? And just do it. And then what's gonna happen, Brian, is that it'll start to become your reputation. You know what I mean? Yeah, 100%. I mean, that's kind of what I've been growing on. Everything comes on referrals. You know, I haven't made a cold call since I started the business because it's everything's on referrals. So what are you looking to? Like it sounds like you're doing it. Are you being impatient? Or you just want to accelerate it? Or what's your thought? I mean, obviously everybody wants to accelerate the small business, right? I mean, but my biggest thing is, it's not that everything hurts when you lose a client, right? But I want to make sure that I'm keeping my family fed, my employees and their families, because that's important. Agency life is hard because you know this, unless you're doing paid media and creative for them, if it's hard for them to see the results of brand creative in a small business, they're looking for sales. Sure, 100%. The bottom line is what they take home. And if it doesn't work, we're taking money off their family's plate too. That's right. That's all I really had, man. I'm excited for the book. I have all the other books, but one thing, one quick thing, I've been following your content for a long time, but this is the original NFT. Oh my God, that was awesome, bro. That's awesome, thank you. I don't even know what year that would have been. 10 years ago, at least? Yeah, 14, 17, maybe seven to 10. That's awesome, brother. Love you. Anyway, that's all I got. Thanks, man. Take care, brother.
