## Transcript
On this episode, the legend stops by. ["The Legend of Gary Vee"] ["The Legend of Gary Vee"] Hey everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk, and this is episode 242 of The Ask Gary Vee Show. I mean, I don't really even know what else to say. Legend in the room. You know what I really like, Tony, and I'll just get right into it? Thank God for your documentary, because people realized that you cursed, and that gave me the air cover. People were like, oh, Gary, it's okay that you cursed now. I'm like, shoo, thank God. I was, people were tweeting like Tony curses like Gary. I'm like, yeah. I used to bring you to my church so that people would feel good about me after listening to yours, and we're doing the same thing for each other. Tony, for the quarter of a person that is watching right now on live streaming on the show that doesn't know who you are, why don't you give me the one second thing? And obviously today's a big day. New book. Look good in the shot. It's a good one. This is pretty quick. Your last money, it was a finance book. I didn't write a book for 25 years. I like writing books like I like selling my organs to the black market. I hate it, but I really want to write a book that would protect people because, you know, we're in the eighth year of the bull market, second largest in history. Everybody knows a crash has come and there's all this volatility. I like this subject. I want to really protect people, but more importantly, show them how a crash is one of the greatest economic times in your life if you're prepared for it to leapfrog from where you are to where you want to be. So if you're a millennial out there and you got all this debt from school still, it's crazy. I know how stressful it must be for you. Bottom line is, you can literally jump during this time. Or if you're a baby boomer, you didn't get started until way too late, and you think it's too late. It's not too late in these situations because the corrections provide opportunities like never before, and people just aren't prepared for it. So I have a partner named Peter Malook. He's the only man in history who rated the number one financial advisor in the United States, three years in a row by Barons, two years in a row by CNBC, and this last year Forbes, this year Forbes just came out with their first list and he's number one. So I want people to know I'm his partner. I'm on his board of directors. But he's grown his business from nothing and basically 2008. He grew to two billion during the worst economic time because he warned everybody, there's got to be a crash. Here's what you're going to do so you don't lose money, and here's what you're going to do so you make more money during the crash than anybody imagined. So with no advertising to two billion. Now he's, when I joined him a year ago, we're partners, there was 17 billion, and we're now 23 and a half billion in assets because this guy knows what he's doing. So I took the best of what I learned from the 50 best investors in the world, and warned about the DeRay Dal, you know, Carl Icon, shrinked it down into just somebody in four hours. Really, by the way, yeah, nice size. Yeah, my last one was 670 pages. Yeah, different size, right? My whole focus here is destroy the fear with real results, with a real strategy, make a playbook, and get people so they can really win. For my audience, I don't talk about this often, but I've mentioned a couple times in the vlog, both Wine Library, my family business, and VaynerMedia were built out of horrible crashes. You know, I got involved in Wine Library full time in 99, and just as I started getting going, 9-11 happened and the 2000 crash happened, and VaynerMedia was started in 2009 right on the back of all the issues. So for me, I'm a big fan of this, and I will say one other tidbit. There's a lot of youngsters who are watching who are on the flip side, are not sitting with debt, who are making some money being influencers, have found themselves into some quick 50, 100, that, nothing will turn $50,000 in cash into millions of dollars quicker than a bust. Yeah, absolutely, well a bust that you participate in. Well, right, so like, so here's something, you might find this interesting. I am sitting on more cash, and not because I've made more. I am actively sitting on cash right now, because my hope is that there is a meltdown, and I can buy things for 20 cents on a dollar, 5 cents on a dollar. How long you been in cash? About a year and a half. Yeah, so you're a perfect person to chat with, because I've had the same mindset before. After interviewing all these people, I learned some really interesting facts. First of all, trying to time the market. Impossible. Yeah, and more above it said, Listen, all these market forecasters, you see on CNBC, he said their whole purpose in life is to make fortune tellers look good, because no one can do it. That's exactly right. I can't do it. That I know. But logically you say, I'm waiting for the crash, because it's gonna come, but while people are waiting. People are making money, 100%. Unbelievable amounts of money. 100%. 250% since 2008. How about just since November with the president, it's 14.5%, right? So tell me how I'm doing this wrong or right. What I'm also doing with the rest of my activity, because it's a piece of my wealth, I'm being ultra aggressive and driving the other way. They are playing on both sides of the extreme. I get it. So it's not real estate or like, yeah. The whole secret is diversifying obviously. That's it. And knowing where you're strong and where you're weak. But what people should know about the market, because it's really important, the stock market is provided, you and I have a million people that have made a fortune and then go broke. That's right. Whether it be an athlete or an actor or anybody. Unlimited people. Because no matter how, you never, what's his name right now? I just saw 50 Cent just went bankrupt. He made $100 million on vitamin water because he got a tip. He made like $400 million and broke. He's about to go through the divorce. What's his name? Pirates of the Caribbean. Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp. Made 750 million, three quarters of a billion. And they say he's going to go bankrupt now. He spent $30,000 a month on wine. So you should have got a couple pieces of that. But the point of the matter is you don't earn your way to a fortune. The way you have a fortune long term is you make money your slave. You and I have done it to multiple businesses, right? Yes. But the other way to do it is through the investing. And I always tell people how great your business is. You should have a money machine on the right side of you with no employees, with no moving parts. It takes 15 minutes a year once you know what to do. That's what this is. But let's talk about the market for a second. People wait to try to time the market. Yes. So watch this. And first of all, you get a correction every year. People are already reacting. And I tell people the market never took a dime from anybody. Not only you did that because you got fearful. Yep. So last year, since 1900, 116 years, we've had an average of one correction a year. Correction, by the way, for people who don't know what it is, when it goes from a market high, you drop by 10% up to 19.99% because at 20% or more, it becomes a bear market or a crash. Okay. So we get one of these every year. So last year in January, worst January in the history of the market, I remember, $2.2 trillion meltdown. Yep. So we're freaking out. Market drops 900 points in a day. All the wealthiest people in the world are Davos. They go interview Ray Dalio, the number one hedge fund guy in the history of the world. And a large hedge fund, 15 billion, he's 165 billion. You need a $5 billion net worth and 100 million to talk to him. Yep. I got him to share with me. They put him on TV. They say, what do we do as the end coming? He goes, it's a correction. He said, go read Tony Robbins book. I explained a theory of how I made 85% of these. Did you sell some copies there? Sold it. I got him to give me the answer. I always made money 85% of the time in 75 years. But here's what you need to know. 80% of those corrections never become a bear market. They all correct back, just like last year. But if you sold, you lose. Of course. But then let's look at the crash. Crash has happened every five years on average. We've gone to eight without one. That's why we're due for one. And you're right to be somewhat prepared. But while you're preparing, there's opportunity that's happening because, first of all, every bear market lasts on average a year. Goes down 33%. But you don't lose 33 unless you sell it. That's right. Even one thing I want people to hear. In two centuries of American business, every single bear market was followed by bull market. So you remember 2008, people lost 50%. This is where Buffett wins. Buffett is so, it's such a great concept. I believe in it so much, which is unless you're betting on America disappearing, you will win. That's it. That's the punchline. By the way, every month on average, we have a new high. So when you hear it's high, oh my God, it's going to crash, it's high. But let me give you one more. This is the timing. This will maybe be the payoff for you. Payoff is, I just did the JPMorgan Alternative Investments Conference in Miami. You have to be a billionaire to attend. You have to prove it with your net worth. There's 400 people there. It's an amazing group. JPMorgan did a 20-year study in Schwab did one also separate. They found in the last 20 years, the S&P 500 gave you an 8.2% return. So you're doubling your money every nine years. Pretty cool thing. But what they found was, if you were out of the market on the 10 best trading days in 20 years, instead of 8.2, you have 4.5, almost half as much money. If you miss the top 20 days, trading days in 20 years, one day a year, you're doing, you're doing trying to be the right kind of, you got a 2% return. You might as well spend months. Makes a ton of sense. If you miss the top 30 days, you lose money. Makes a ton of sense. In 20 years. Makes sense. So the most difficult, the dumbest thing you can do is be on the market. Not you. No, no, I get it. I'm plenty in the market. I'm plenty in the market. Plenty in the market. Because I believe in it. And then also being prepared. So Tony, listen. First of all, one of my favorite things about you from afar. We get to hang once at a blue moon, random calls here and there. But from afar, you know what I love about you? You fucking hustle. Like I feel like the book came out today. You're freaking everywhere doing your thing. That's what you're good at. We have a very large audience of like, I know what you're doing. But here we have a real awesome opportunity. Because I think we're going to go deep in a narrow field. So the majority of these people, I don't think are looking at the stock market. I even look at the characters here. The way they think of, yeah. The way they're thinking about the stock market. So different. In a world where you might not have cash and where you might have debt. Or if you're not even in debt, you just don't have a lot of cash. Talk to me about somebody sitting with $10,000. Which by the way, for a high percentage. This is still a ton. But is there anything that, if they have $1,500, should they be out of the market? Like what are they? I know we're going very, very, very micro here. But I actually want to bring value. My pay off is actually bringing value to everybody watching. Go ahead. I'm going to say, I give an example in the book here. And I'm going to take a phone call. Get ready for phone calls. Chris, you ready? Alright. So forget just the $10,000. What matters is the system you put in place. The shit you do randomly every now and then because you got money is not going to help you much, right? Especially if it's a fucking fat whip or a watch. I don't even want to start. So the number one most important financial decision for everyone watching, everyone in this room, really, we all know you've got to become an owner instead of somebody that is constantly utilizing products. In other words, if you have an iPhone and you don't own Apple, what's wrong? You're a consumer, you're not an owner. You've got to become an owner. How do you do it? Every person in this room has got, regardless of what you think you have the money or not, to make the most important financial decision, which says to be an owner, I have to take a percentage of my income and no matter what, off the top, automate it so I don't see it, put that in investment account. Now what's the number? You might say, I can't Tony, I'm starting my business, I'm strapped. I tell all business owners the example of a gentlemen two story, Theodore Johnson, 1950s, works for EPS. Guy never makes more than $14,000 in a year. He retires with $71 million. He gives away $35 million while he's still alive. So good. How is that possible? A friend of his did what we're teaching, comes to him and says, I'm going to make you rich. He goes, I'm not rich, I make $14,000 a year, right? He says, I'll make you rich and I'm going to put a 20% tax on you. He goes, what are you talking about? I can't pay my bills as it is. He said, listen to me. Adjust. If the government gave you an additional 20% tax, you'd bet you, yell, you'd scream, and you'd pay it because you have to and your brain adjust. But that money goes in this investment account. The compounding of that account made him $70 million and it ever made him $14 million. Andy, do you have Facebook stock? Because of all the chatter we always have in here? That's the punchline, right? We know because we live in this world for the last three years. I've been yelling and Andy will tell you, not yet, that just buy, we know Facebook's underpriced. That's even narrow. Here's what you've got to be careful of. This is something Ray Dalio taught me when I was the smartest man on the face of the earth. He said, Tony, I don't care what it is you know, you're going to invest in what you know because you have certainty. Of course. Right? Whatever you know is going to drop 50 to 70% sometime in your life. That's right. He said if it's later in life, it's a little bit worse. Which is why diversity matters. That's why diversity matters. But let's talk about that for a minute. And Ray's right. That's just non-debatable. That's data. It is interesting to see where... What I'm saying is you don't want to just own Facebook. Of course not. You've got to have across the board because you say I want to have the best one on Facebook. There is an interesting debate that if you're actually knowledgeable about a sector and you're only putting $2,000 to $4,000 a year to work, that's an interesting debate. And by the way, Netflix and Amazon, yeah. When you're this young, you can also be more heavily-oriented stocks. You can take more losses because you have more time. But think of it this way. Just go back to compounding as a simple example. Guy in here, I talk about 19 years old, dad convinces him to save $300 a month, $4,000 a year. So it's within the range of anybody here you're talking about. Guy starts at 19, stops doing it at 28. He only puts in 35 grand. He puts it in the market. The market's going 10% over 30 years, but let's use 8% to be more conservative. Last 20 years, it's been more 8%. At 8%, that'll grow to $941,000 without another dime. He'll have a million bucks off of $50,000. You're preaching. But on the other hand, his best friend waits till he's 29. He does the same thing, but he has to keep investing to 65. He puts in almost 180 grand and he doesn't get the million. The math is the math. You got to get it. All right. You got some? Go ahead. You inspire that? I want to tell everybody by the way. It's going to work. You're going to remember this interview your whole life. Let's go. Everybody by the way, for everybody watching, this book, my last book, I donated 100% of the profits, $5 million. I'm doing the same thing with this one. We fed 100 million people between my donation and the additional donations I made in 2015. 100 million people last year through my partnership with Feeding America. We're going to be 100 million people. 100% of this goes to that. We're going to feed a billion people over the next seven years to give you an idea. It's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. It's all coming from the book. While Chris is trying to figure out how to dial a phone, talk to me real quick about the Netflix documentary impact. I try to trade culture and attention. I could taste it in the ecosystem. You've been a known brand for decades. What was the impact of that documentary? Huge. It's huge because it's taken ... I decided to put on Netflix because it immediately put me in 172 countries and they translated it for all those languages. It's huge. The level of distribution. Global. It's free. They've got five stars. It took off like crazy. They're concentrating. I went to the fight with Diaz versus ... There we go. I went to UFC fight and it's like ... We'll pick it up. All these young guys coming up to me. Yep. Normally wouldn't know that it would have happened. Gary Vaynerchuk. You're on the Ask Gary Vee Show with Tony Robbins. What's your name and are you excited? Holy shit. I'm so excited. I'm a huge fan of both of you guys. This is absolutely incredible. My name is Brandon Dendis and I'm coming from Denver, Colorado. Love it man, what's your question? So it's a little bit off topic. That's okay. We adjust. But both of you are a huge advocate for gratitude and that kind of delivers your energy and how you guys interact with everyone, especially you Gary on social media, stuff like that. So my question for you is like, how do you become so grateful? So grateful, yeah exactly. To have this energy, especially from Tony's position, I'm just like, I dove into your documentary on Netflix and that was actually the first time I was exposed to you. Actually my father who owns an independent agency in Connecticut, very successful. Quoted you as a huge inspiration. So I kind of dove into your content and fell into your hands and your guidance. They're big ass hands too by the way, Jesus. Well listen, thank you for the question Tony. Your question is how do you create the gratitude? Not quite clear. Yeah, go ahead. How do you become so grateful and because of that you live a life of. I think this is actually, this is a great first question but thank you so much because I actually think he nailed it which is, I actually think he's right. Like in what I see in you and from others, like gratitude, it's incredible what gratitude does. Well the two things that mess everybody up are anger and fear. When you let them dominate you, you're in trouble and you can't be angry and grateful simultaneously. The antidote, it's the only antidote that really works and you can't be fearful and grateful simultaneously. So for me the answer is question, I don't hope I'm gonna be grateful. I have a system like anything in life. If you're a great pilot, you know how to fly a jet, you still have a checklist. Because if you miss the checklist, the consequences are too big. So I'm not a big meditator. My meditations have been active, it's been physical, it's been in nature, it's been ripping things open, it's being on stage. But I started a few years ago doing what I call priming and what priming is is most people think their thoughts are their thoughts. When really your thoughts have been primed by the environment. That's why you wanna create the environments like you create and I create because it makes you be your best. But specifically there was a study where they took a group of actors, they had them go out to 200 people. And the only thing different, they walked up each person and the only different was they held a cup of coffee, they walked up to you as strange and go, do all this for a second, they'd look down so you can't say yes or no and you'd end up taking it. They get their phone, they adjust it, they take it back and say thank you. That's the whole thing. Same facial expression for every person. Only difference. Half got an iced coffee, the other got hot coffee. Now 30 minutes go by. They send out an assistant, a research assistant with a clipboard and they come up to these same individuals and say, if you give us two minutes of your time we'll give you $20. Will you just read these three paragraphs and tell us what you think of this character? There's a couple questions. They read the three paragraphs and they say, what do you think of the main character in this little story? 81% that were given iced coffee, say the person is cold and uncaring. 80%, a 1% variance of those who are hot coffee, say the person's warm and connected and caring. With nothing else but coffee 30 minutes earlier, iced cold. I could take a 50 of these. So what I do is I get up every morning and I make a radical change in my state and I have a simple deal with myself. I prime for 10 minutes every day. Because if you don't have 10 minutes, you don't have a life. No excuse. So I come in, I do this radical breathing change. These three sets of 30 breaths when I bring the air in and explode it out my nose. Because I'm sure you know from Eastern philosophy the breath is like the string on a kite. The mind is the kite. You can change the mind through breath. So I do this radical breathing, takes a minute. Then I do three things for three minutes. It's really simple. I take three minutes and I focus on three specific individual things that I'm grateful for. But I don't think about them intellectually. I step into the moment, remember it, feel it. And so what it does is it activates it not as a thought but as a biochemistry. Then I do three minutes of prayer and blessings starting with my family and moving out to everybody and my clients, friends, people I meet. And then I do three minutes on what I call three to thrive. Where I focus on three important outcomes that I have that I wanna accomplish. But I don't think about wanna accomplish it. I see it, I feel it, experiences done. I feel grateful. I often- That's your move. 15 or 20 minutes are after this. It feels so good. But what's happened is now you're primed. You're not hoping you're in prime time. You are in prime time. And to me, that's how I do it. And once you prime yourself, you start noticing things to be grateful for all the time. And when I asked Sir John Templeton, one of the first billionaire investor, international investor in the whole world, started with nothing, built to that. When I asked him, I said, what's the secret to wealth? I'll never forget. He looked at me and smiled and he said, Tony, it's what you teach. I said, well, I teach a lot of things. Which thing? And he goes, gratitude. He goes, you and I, how many billionaires do you and I know that are miserable human beings and they're so unhappy? He said, they're poor. And if you've got a billion dollars, but you're frustrated, angry and sad all the time, your life is frustrated, angry and sad. How many people know of nothing, but they're grateful for their family, for their health and they're there. So that is the game. It really is. To me, it comes down to its cousin, which is perspective. Yes. So I do something very similar. Every single day, I make pretend that my mother, dad, sister, brother, wife or children are killed. Now I know this is a different version of it. I know. You didn't expect that one? You crazy son of a bitch. I know it's a little different. Yes. They get stabbed in the eye and then they take out the and do go on and... Yes. Sometimes even in detail, but I will tell you, it's very fleeting. It usually happens within the tour. But I promise you, I know it's a little left field. It's insane what that perspective does for me. Nothing. And I feel it. It's contrast. And I feel it. And I feel it in my soul. And it just makes every bad thing. And by the way, and I'm sure for your business, when you're the last line of defense, you know how they say occupation on the doctor form? The last time I filled it out, I said firefighter. Because that's what I think I do for a living. Like it's just problems. Like when I get done with this interview, I'm gonna look at my phone, seven problems, seven fires to put out. Like that's what I do. For me, it's perspective. Like I don't understand how people don't get that there's seven plus billion people, that there's so many people that have it worse than you. Look, if you live in this country, I feed 100 people a year, I care. But if you live in poverty in this country, you're the 1%, you're not the 99%. I know. 2-3rd of the planet lives on $2.50 a day, $900 a year. If you're making $18,000 a year, I don't want you to make $18,000. But you gotta start with gratitude that you're one of the richest humans on earth. That doesn't feel like a pejor. Preaching, D-Rock, don't produce the show. Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and you're on the Ask Gary Vee show. Oh, there is no fucking way I got this line. You're on, man. What's your name? Where are you from? Miguel from, I live in California. Awesome, Miguel. What can we help you with? Okay, so, god damn, hold on. All right. All right, so, I'm 20 years old. I'm in college right now. I am in my junior year. The hours are really crazy because I'm going to school for game design. That's what I really want to do. I really want to be able to just purchase my own games to go. Okay. So, I also, I work part-time. I just started a marketing business just to try and bring more money in. But this is the first business thing I've ever done. And I'm trying to start my own gaming YouTube channel just to get my name word out there and learn how to put my, learn basically how to get on my own following and become an influencer for video games myself. My question is, how do you know whether or not you're trying to basically take too much on? Right, are you stretching yourself then? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I want to know how do you know when you get to that point. I got it. Tony, this is such a classic question for a lot of entrepreneurs. You've done it, I've done it. We've lived our lives, right? Like, you know, like, where does doing a lot of different things to see if there's upside in it? Which all my great things have come from. You too. Stop and where does it start to, you're taking on too much and now you're trying to do everything which means you're doing nothing. Yeah. First of all, I want to thank you for the question. Most people who start business very often, we'll start two and three, four more. And the reason they do it is because the first one isn't succeeding or they no longer are due for. They lack patience. Exactly right. And so what happens to that person is they're never going to be successful in most cases. Unless they get lucky, you can get lucky. Bounce across something that's easier to do. But most people are always looking for that next level. What my view is, is it's great to test all these things. You've got to find what is your flagship? What is it that you're going to commit your soul to? Because if you don't do that, the inevitable challenge are going to come up and you're going to then move on to something else that's more enjoyable. And so the other thing I look at is businesses about constantly not only adding such massive value, doing more for others than anybody else, but it's also simultaneously about your own psychology. It's your ability to go through thresholds of control. It's like, I can remember when I didn't have $50,000 to keep the doors open on my company and I had 12 employees and 11 wanted to quit because they hated the person running the show. And $50,000 would be like $500 million to me today. And I figured out how to get through that threshold. And once I did, all the problems related to that were handled. I know you've done this as well. And then I had a $5 million lawsuit. It was totally unfair and unjust. And I finally had just the amount of time energy and finally had to bite the bullet and do it. And $5 million was more than I could remember. Then I had a partner who took a company who was losing $1 million a day and turned it to $1.5 billion in positive EBITDA. I'm not mentioning names, Amway. And he wanted me to join him in business with some other partners, not doing the multi-level side, did the business, put in $10 million. We all put in $10 million, it was $40 million a debt. But I signed joint and several, which I didn't understand in those days what that meant. And two of my partners were supposedly billionaires and they went broke. We bought some more companies. I ended up with $120 million in debt that I was on the hook for. No one else had any money. And I'm getting up to do a seminar, wanting to throw up. It was a new threshold of control. So you know when you ski or you snowboard and you think you're maybe just new at it and you think you're going down a blue or green, it turns out to be a double black. And you're like, well, fuck. And so you have two choices. One is you start to go down and you freak out and you're gonna die, you slam on the ground, try to hang on for dear life. Or the other is, baby, you focus on where you wanna go and you find a way to curve, you find a way to cut. And once you do it a couple of times, you have no more fear of that element. My biggest one out of that, that led me to a billion. I have 31 companies now to give you an idea. Seven different industries, it's diverse as like, stem cells to virtual reality. You have the exclusive to the NBA now and virtual reality, give an example. We do, I got 1200 employees, we're on three continents and we got $5 billion in sales. But I did that because I first stayed on one fricking thing. I got so masterful at it. The way I look at it, I give it one more metaphor. Probably not old enough to remember this, but I'm old member, a guy named Mel. I'll put it in his name, he was the guy that. Mel's diner, the great 80s sitcom? No, the guy that looked for gold on the Spanish galleon. I'll forget his name, but anyway, he found a half a billion dollars in gold, but it took him like 31 years to do it. And you can't live on that, that's where it starts. Maybe he loved the journey though. He did not love the journey. The son was killed on the journey. Well, that's bad. He made, no, can you imagine 31 years of going out there, getting money from investors and showing nothing? I mean, after a year, two, five, 10, some point you hit your breaking point. He never did his breaking point. So I looked at my businesses back then, and I was always looking for the new business that was a great opportunity. I love what I was doing. It's emotionally rewarding, but low margin business. And I had these meetings with a group of billionaires and they said, you have not maximized. And then I saw this guy, Val, and I thought, I don't believe, I have not the right beliefs. You need three beliefs to be successful in your business the highest level. You have to believe number one, what does this guy have to believe to go 31 years? He had to believe number one, the treasure was out there. Number two, he had to believe I'm gonna find it. And number three, he had to believe it's gonna be worth it. If you don't believe there's that treasure in your business, you're gonna have to find it. And you gotta use those three things to go to another level. Miguel, to answer your question, I've now had a career for 20 plus years. At every minute was running one of two companies, Wine Library or VaynerMedia. There was never a day in my life where I didn't have something that I called the 80% of what I do. That's exactly what you were saying. I call it the meat, the main dish. You can go and have side dishes. And if your meat, if your steak is perfect, you'll always be able to absorb the losses because they're smaller losses. And then when something over here becomes bigger, you can turn that into the main part and that could become the steak. Too many people have all side dishes and no steak. I always say something else about it too. Most people massively overestimate what they're gonna do in a year and they underestimate what they can do in a decade. So what happens is they get all disappointed and frustrated and they don't stay with the game. I talk to people. Talk to me about lack of patience. This is something, you know, I've been pounding patience. You've been pounding patience? Yeah, this is, I actually, do you know that I genuinely think I'm the most patient? Do you know that I think I'm a, Do you know that I genuinely call myself a tortoise in a hair's costume? Don't let my energy or my stage presence confuse what I've actually been doing. No, I get it, I'm teasing you. I know you are. But I think, but the reason I wanna put it out there is, I think it's an important thing that, it's an enormously important variable. I think so too. Let me mention one thing with it. You really, I think all businesses though, we've talked about focus. I just wanna add one last piece to that before we go to what you're saying. I think all businesses should be running two businesses. The business you're in and the business you're becoming. Because if you only run the business you're excited about, you're gonna become, you're gonna miss the cash flow of managing a business. If you only focus on the day to day, you're not anticipating the competition. This is GaryVee and you're in the Ask GaryVee show with Tony Robbins. Who's this? Yo, Gary, it's Nico from Chicago, man. Nico, how are you? I'm good, how are you? Good, man, what's your question? All right, so just a couple of sentences to give you a cap of what I do. I'm building two things right now, which is Small Business, my creative studio, and my personal brand. Okay. So my creative studio does like photo, video content for small businesses, and my personal brand is just, my creative content and me documenting my life through Instagram and YouTube. So I'm wondering should I leverage, or should I use my leverage and community for my personal brand and funnel that into my business, or should I keep them separate, or what do you think I should do? Well look, obviously I know why you're asking this because I've lived this life, right? Now the thing that's interesting about me, and I've talked about this, is a lot of my audience doesn't necessarily represent the clients of VaynerMedia. VaynerMedia does, you know, gonna do $125 million in revenue this year, and it's mainly Fortune 500 companies who are not necessarily watching my 25 minute vlog. Now what I knew about being in the business you'll be in the future is that the technology would drag people down, and that the 53 year old cliche executive would eventually watch YouTube and be on Instagram. I would tell you, here's what I would say to you brother, intent matters so much. As long as the content you're putting out and the stuff you're doing creatively isn't just a gateway to get clients, just because of that, I think you'll be perfectly fine. It's gonna happen naturally anyway, first and foremost, because people are gonna become aware of you. I think, you know, listen, I wrote a book called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. I think it's okay on your personal brand, once in a while, say hey, is anybody looking for small business clients? As long as that's three, six, seven percent of your, and that's an arbitrary number. As long as your audience doesn't feel like that's your intent, look, Tony and I get compared to a lot of people that we are opposite of, but it's our energy and the way we roll that people think we look that part. The intent matters, so I would tell you that, you know, as long as you're asking, instead of making, you win. Do you know how many people have landing pages where they get you in and you got some content and then all of a sudden you gotta pay to keep going? That's making people pay. Putting out good stuff to the world and then maybe some of it coming your way, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook was give, give, give, and then ask. Most people interpreted it as give, give, give, and then take. That's a very big difference. Okay, so my first brand is like the complete, like it's exactly what you're describing and it has nothing to do with my business. It will work. It will work. If you compare it to a KT, what that kind of shit. Dude, do you know how many people have given me business because I'm a Jets fan? That's real. We connected on the Jets, but it became a, like absolutely, speak your truths, have pure intent, work hard, a lot of good things happen to it. And by the way, I heard your structure, your strategy's on point. You've got an 80% stake, you're building personal brand over at 20, you're doing YouTube and Instagram today as we record this, that's right. So you've got every piece in place. Keep going with your intuition. All right, thanks brother. Love you man. Love you too man. Thanks Tony. All right. Tony, while we transition, we'll get one more question in here. What's going on with you in social media? I remember very, very, very, the last time I reached out to you, I got inspired. I called you and I said, bro, snapchat. This was 15 months ago. Talk to me about your journey on that and one other thing that we have to do before we leave. I've never asked you this and I think it's really funny to ask here and you may not remember. I will never forget being at South by Southwest 2008, nine or 10 and I get this email and says, Anthony Robbins and then it's a boy's email. And I'm like, click, it's like, Gary, Tony Robbins. And I'm like, holy shit. I don't know if you recall that. But what I'm curious about is, do you recall why you wrote that email? I don't know that in particular, but I use audio emails much more than regular emails because you hear your voice in that context. So you can't get that in normally email. Plus, if it's a couple of lines, I'll type it, but if something has a motion to it, I want you to hear it so I can get the piece there. So that's it. I love it. All right, let's go to this. And I'm not gonna let you off the hook. I wanna know what's going on with you in social. Oh, that's a question. Let's see this person. You got it, go. Hello? Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and you're in the Ask Gary Vee show with Tony Robbins. Fucking, hey, it is Gary Vee. It is. Thank you, brother. Who's this? This is Doug Austin, Texas. Doug Austin, Texas. I love them in. My question for you is how can I possibly thank Gary Vee for pushing me through all these years? Starting with 2007, I'm looking at my 101 Wines right now, signed by you. Know your pal. You were in Austin, the book signing. Tony, love you and shallow how. Amazing. I just wanted to call you. I'm hoping to win the Spatoshi Company here in Austin, Texas. Just grass rooting it. It's been fun and I appreciate you just hustling and showing us how it's done, man. I appreciate it. Listen, you go impact one other person the right way to do it and that's more than a payback. But if you find yourself in New York or wherever I am, I'm gonna be in Austin a couple of weeks for South by you. Come and shake my hand. Send an email to Gary. Send an email to my hair, brother. I will, man. It's good to see you. Thank you for the love. Thanks. I forgot about that amazing appearance you made. Was that fun? Which one? The Hollywood, when you became a Hollywood star. You know what's interesting is the guy that wrote that is legally blind. That's why the story is about seeing the beauty in someone that's in service. I did not know that. And he bought my audio program because he was blind. He had personal power. He listened to it. He went to the Fairly Brothers, never wrote a movie in his life, sold him film. They'd asked me three times to be in films. I said, look, I'm not an actor. I appreciate it. But now they sent me this script. They're like, you're in it. Made me laugh or cry. But then what they didn't tell me was, they rewrote that section. The writer didn't do it. He had like a fortune teller doing it. They said, ah, it's bullshit. If you were stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins your life would change. So I show up and I start speaking and they didn't tell him and they didn't tell me this is how it came about. So here's my voice and he come up, Tony Robbins, and tells me the whole story. So cool. Then I go to do the piece and I got Jason Alexander there. And I said, look guys, you wrote this whole thing on the center of it. That's not what, yeah. It's not me. I'm just gonna do my thing. So I said, let me show you. He goes, well, there's no script. I said, he's an actor. Let him act. And so when I heal him like that, when you see him shocked, that is an acting. He wasn't prepared for it to give you an idea. We did it over and over again. It was a fun trip. Tony, end with this for me. What has been your journey on social? Where are you now? What are you excited about? Are you into it? Is it hard for you if you're very busy? Like every, you know, don't pander to us. I'm actually, I'm curious to where you're at. This young man right here runs it for me. So Tyler, he does a great job. But I do all my own personal components. I get him to go, let's get the pictures, the graphics and all those things. I found that Facebook Live is one of my favorite tools at this stage. Cause we get three quarters of a million people. Watch it. You have your own show. He's gone there and boom, it goes. So that tool to me is one of the most valuable tools. But you know, we've got a million people on Instagram. Tyler, we've got 10 million people there. What do you want to see him? This is your chance. This is the air cover you've been waiting for. I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna be your shield here. This is the right room to do this. Where's the place that you'd like to see him focus a little more on? For me, how do you ask me six months ago, I would have said Snapchat. And I'll say Instagram stories. We're doing it today. He's taking a little run through on it. I love it. He's digging it. It's ephemeral. It's here today, got tomorrow. But he's able to connect with his fans and give them that little sneak peek behind the scenes of what he's up to. My man. I'd love to see that. And I love that Instagram is more your personal life to a great extent. Each piece, if you're going through. Yeah, Facebook's like mainstream media. And by the way, they have been flowed to his point. He's exactly right. Six months ago would have been Snapchat. And tomorrow somebody might buy Vine, create one feature and we all care. It's such, it's a moving market. Without a doubt. Without a doubt. My man. Thank you, brother. It's great to see you. Listen, people watching, I want to plant one seed, one seed for you too. Both of us have achieved a lot. I'm sure many of you have achieved a lot too. Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure. This guy's very fulfilled. That's the way he works 24 hours a day. His whole hustle is that he fulfills him. Same thing with me. If you don't find what fulfills you, all the achievements worthless. I had a really cool conversation I talk about at the end of the book here because money is not gonna make you happy. It'll give you resources. It'll give you tools. But you got a two million year old brain that's always looking for what's wrong because it's trying to make you survive. If you're gonna override that, you've got to learn what it is that's gonna fulfill you most. And if you discover that and you pour all of your juice into that, forget the money. The money will be fine. But what you really will have is an extraordinary life. That's what this character has done for himself because he lives it every single day. I live it every single day. There's nothing short of that that's gonna give you what you want. So, hoping you read this, you'll also find there's pieces there about how to master the mind. Cause this is what messes this up. You can be a billionaire and be miserable. Just the operating system, baby. We're the only creatures in the planet that can think of thought and make ourselves miserable and think of thought and make ourselves euphoric. So, take control of your mind. That's really the end of the game for you. That's how you serve up. Two things. You got to ask the question of the day. That's what every guest does. So, you get to ask a question and there'll be thousands of comments on Facebook and YouTube. So, give that a thought of what question you want answered. Number two, I'm about to take a picture with this man. I'm gonna give away a hundred copies of this on Instagram over the next 24 hours. Cool, that's exciting. Question I have is, what is your definition of a magnificent life? I'd really be curious. Like, what's your criteria for a magnificent life? Which to me is life on your terms. It's different for everybody. I'd love to know what yours is. I'd love to see the variety of people. Thank you, brother. My pleasure. Good seeing you, man. You keep asking questions, we'll keep answering them.
