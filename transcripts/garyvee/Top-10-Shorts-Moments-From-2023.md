And the way I took that scene was, I'll see you in 10 years, motherfucker. You know what it feels like to be 26 years old, have people that you went to high school with come to your liquor store, look you dead in the face as they pulled up in their BMW, and say, oh, you work for your dad, and then you bring them up on their case of champagne, and you bring it out to their car and put it in their trunk, and they look you in the face with pity? And the way I took that scene was, I'll see you in 10 years, motherfucker. I have friends who make $42,000 a year, work 9 to 4, but they're pumped, and they'll text me how happy they are to be the coach of their kids baseball team. And that's amazing. I'm actually weirdly envious. But I have friends who have $100 million in the bank, who are still hungry, who want to do even more, who will complain to me because they know I work a lot about no work-life balance, and they don't get to spend enough time with their family, and I'm like, you have $100 million. You could stay home. Like, you're in control. Don't complain about it. You've made that choice. You want to spend more time with your family? Spend more time with your family. How many people here have used chat, gpt, or an AI thing? I don't think people realize that Alexa and Google Home and Apple Home are about to use this for real, for real. I don't think people realize it's going to look like this. Hey, Alexa, I have six of my son's friends coming over. Two are lactose intolerant. One is vegan. Three are a mess, and I'd like them to eat it. And I'd like them to eat a little healthier. I only have a couple hundred bucks in budget, and they'll be here for about four or five hours, but I'll also need something quick and snacky in the morning because they're going to sleep over, and I want to send them home with something. Send it. That's how people are going to shop. So what I just said is real life in five, seven, nine, ten years. How do I know that the person I'm going to hire is one? You don't. Take it, Gary. I've got really good hiring advice. Learn to fire fast. You guys have your ego tied up in your hiring. You think you're so good at hiring, and then you hire somebody and they're shit, but you may pretend they're not because firing them admits that you were wrong. So it's your own ego that's holding you back. My ego is only balanced by my humility. I hired somebody for hundreds of thousands of dollars six months ago. Interviewed him three times. I fired him one day into working at VaynerMedia. I'm like, fuck. Check your ego in the door. You're not that great at fucking hiring, but good news, nobody is. There's this clip going around on the internet where a guy asked him, did he fail the season? Do you get a promotion every year? No, right? So every year you work as a failure? No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal, which is to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your parents. You work towards a goal. It's not a failure. It's steps to success. I love that Yanis did that because there's so many comps to it. Right now, a lot of people are realizing what athletes are dealing with because now everyone's putting themselves out there and they're getting commented about everything, about everything, about everything. One bad night and everyone's got all sorts of things to say. Everyone of us in this room right now, we have bad days, but it's hidden. It's a very interesting human psychology conversation. I love that viral clip is going because I hope it helps people. I'll tell you exactly who I am. Ready? I want to write an article about champagne that focuses on the fact that Prosecco from Italy is now a good alternative for a portion of the price. I want you to historically reference other times in history when something was the establishment and a product came along that was equal of quality, but a fraction of the price, and speak to it in a manner that helps people understand that quality of flavor is subjective, but prices not. Enter. The prompting. I just wrote a very good article for the London Times about Prosecco and champagne. Something will be outputted and then I'm going to read it and I'm going to add 10 more sentences and edit six more sentences. So the creativity of the writer and the ability of the editor becomes a new form of a human being. I just literally talked out to you. I would like some lemonade. Are you selling any? Okay. Well, then I want some, my friend. This is your first sale? What's your name, buddy? Andrew. Andrew? All right. Pink lemonade. All right. That's the good stuff. No, you got to give him more. Oh, you got to. That's good. That's good. I like that kind of score. All right. How much? One dollar. Okay. Well, I'm going to give you 20. Is that okay? Yeah, we got some change. No, no, you keep the change. Oh my goodness. What do you say? Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you so much, bro. This is delicious. You made this? You or mom? Tell the truth. Yeah, we kind of worked together. You're a team? Yeah. All right. Thank you, buddy. Have the best day. I'm 27 and I'm trying to keep myself going every day and I kind of struggle sometimes. So what is your take on that? What do you struggle with, brother? I think just being motivated to get to my angle. What's your angle? Honestly, six figures have a big house. I'm being a little materialistic, but... Well, that's why you're struggling. You're literally the hypothesis I have. Hypothesis I have of why people are unhappy. You just made up an arbitrary goal for yourself based on material things without realizing the second you walk into that home and you make six figures, nothing's changed. Damn, that was... I would rather have someone be honest with me, you know? So... Even better, brother. I'm telling you from the deepest levels of love that you can even imagine. I know you. I've met a thousand of you. All of them have lost the second they got there. You've been able to turn your perspective to something that's very easy to turn your perspective to. The world is very good at selling this. It's just super not true, bro. 20 years ago, making a million is the way people talk about making a billion. It was that not achievable for almost everyone. And now we all walk around and these kids are confused. Like, okay, so America, very rich country, one of the richest in the world. The top 1% of earners in America, the bottom, the last person in the top 1%, the top 1% is 440,000 a year. That's wild. It's crazy. That's wild. Let me say real slow. Yeah. If you make more than 440,000 a year, you're in the top 1% of people in America. Nah, that's wild. Yeah, man. I call this the high school party rule. I think this is the most interesting move in high school culture. You're a mid-tier popular person. You can't be the coolest and you can't be a nerd and off the grid. Like in the rank of 300 coolest kids in your class, you are 200. You're below the middle. If you're lucky enough that your parents don't give a fuck or travel too much or something else in your environment. If you were able to somewhere between sophomore and junior year of high school host the party and get everybody to come to your house and shit on your house, but you held it, you go from 200 to 92 to 13. If you think back to your high school, the person that was not necessarily built to be popular freshman year who hacked the system was the one that realized that if they hosted the party, it would elevate their brand within the ecosystem. If you're hosting the podcast in a very small niche and you're the host and you're reaching out and saying, hey Rick, number one successful commercial real estate personality in all of Texas, I'd love for you to be a guest on my show. They're like, oh shit. Whoever can host the party first wins the land grab.
