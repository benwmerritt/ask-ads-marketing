## Transcript
Tiktok Live puts you into fucking people's feeds while you're on, so on Instagram you go on, it pings all your users and a certain percentage comes over and then it declines. For me it's like 2,000, come on right away and then five minutes later from YAP and I look up in the corner it's 800, it declines. Cause my crew gets pinged, they check it out, then again, okay fuck with Gary, he's doing it out. Tiktok you go on, pings. And you're, that's right, you start, you look over, there's 600 and then you look an hour later, you weren't even doing anything proper and there's 4,000 people there. And here's the big thing, I'm saying to you three and obviously I'm saying it for everyone at home. Attention is the number one asset. Hey everybody, welcome to another episode of Podcasts with Friends. I've got three phenomenal friends in the building, most of all, I wanna give a huge shout out to everybody on Twitch that is watching this podcast live right now. I will be glancing over and trying to incorporate you into the show. If you're listening at home on the treadmill or a couple days later whenever we post this, make sure you go to twitch.tv slash garybee, subscribe up. Big shout out to everybody who's about to give some subscribes, gift subs and all that. And so I'm excited to be here, we're gonna go around the horn and say hello first of all. And so why don't all three of you find gentlemen, take two, three minutes on not only who you are, but why don't you tell the VaynerNation that's tuned in and obviously everybody listening at home a little bit about who you are. So let's start with you, Breeze. Hello, I'm Kevin Spees, I'm known on the internet as a grill guy. I do no grilling. Yeah, that's what I do. Originally, I was an educator, I actually know Brandon from a past work experience. I love that. John Dewey High School, pass fail baby. It's the only way I got through high school. Pass fail, pass fail baby. So I was a basketball coach and teacher at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn. Love. He graciously donated a scoreboard to our team and was a graduation speaker. So we got to chop it up a few years back. It's a very eco show, I'm excited about this. Jersey Brooklyn Queens. Speaking of Queens, I was a coach at York College in Queens for a little bit. That's NIMBY, that's right down the block. That's Jamaica. Jamaica, right in me. And then started coaching in New Jersey and moved out through New Jersey, had a son and during paternity leave just started. What part of Jersey? I'm in Scotch Plains. Oh, I know, super well. My dad's first liquor store was in Clark, Jersey. Yes. New York Catholic. Yes, right down the street. I grew up in Edison. Okay, yeah, so we're all, we all know the same spots. It's a very Jersey dude show. So you better, you better, New York Tri State, you better really settle the fuck in everyone because it's about to happen. It's about to happen. So okay, so you know during the paternity leave, you're like, fuck it, let me make videos. Kind of, actually I had a friend who works at a media company called Doing Things Media. And they said, hey, we have this idea for a millennial dad grilling show. Like, would you want to do it? I said, sure, I'll give it a shot. And I was really bad at it. As one does. Yeah, I was really, really bad at it. But I was, I'm pretending to leave. So give me, let me try it. I started making skits, 30 second skits, minute skits with my phone and like a $15 tripod, which I still use. And slowly, but surely over time. It hit. It hit, yeah. There wasn't like a one day that like really. Yeah, it just, it took time. And now I do it full time. I'm no longer teaching, no longer coaching. I miss a lot of them. And what's the handle that everyone could find you on? Grill Guy, at Grill Guy. At Grill Guy, underscore on TikTok. Grill Guy. That hurts you, right? That underscore fucks with you. Yeah, mess with me a little bit. I saw, I don't know who I gotta pay, but eventually I should go bang my ass. Yeah, let me know. Good segue, Brandon, why don't you tell the, what's yours about this? It's an OG legend to everyone. Pay your fucking respects in the chat. Thank you, sir, well, I appreciate it. Good to see you again. I feel grindin' and you know, I still wake up broke. Still working. Yeah, I still work and love the work. If somebody comes to my office again and asks me what, when the fuck I'm retiring, I'm gonna be really pissed. Cause it's disrespectful. You're gonna die at your desk, right? I'm like, I retire when I'm ready. Are you gonna die at your desk or are you gonna retire? I wanna get home first before it. I worry about the dying at the desk. That would be troublesome. That's the slang term from, do you think you'll work? No, I get it. I'm gonna work, yeah, I'm going to the end, yeah. I'm gonna work, I'm gonna negotiate my burial. It's gonna be a hobby. Yeah, I'm negotiating everything. And I'm already working with the man upstairs trying to get that squared away. This is a lot of work to be done. I think the first thing is like, first of all, thanks for having me. And you know, I'm not at Steiner anymore, which is so crazy. And we were just having dinner. And I remember you saying, brand your brand, your name, it's bigger than any of it. Don't worry about it. Like whatever way it goes, don't forget you got your name. You're never gonna lose it. And it's hard to beat not at Steiner. But I just, I love that the Steiner thing's still living on, but I came up with something better, which I remember I did and I was telling you about and I put it into play. And collectableexchange.com is like this marketplace. I realized there was a lot of older people like me that have a shitload of stuff and they don't know what to do with it. So now we have like 150,000 items on there. I don't think I won 35 at Steiner. And I bought Starstock. You're a fan of Starstock. I got to get in the trading card game. So, and what's great about the trading card is like, I'm a crazy collector. Obviously I have a lot of issues. But I wasn't like a trading card like Guru. I'm a collectable deep into it. And now like I'm learning from all these kids that are coming at me like, Starstock should be this, Starstock should be that. I'm in a position though to make it into that. I love it. So I think you can never not listen to your customers. And that's kind of where I'm at. I'm loving the collectable business. I'm loving that there's so many young kids in this game. And I love when I hear from them. And I love the diversity of the product I'm able to carry now. So one more thing is you're not gonna believe this shit. But this weekend I'm opening up my first show with eBay Live. Let's go. I'm doing a regular show three times a week. I went to them. I wanted to be like an educator. Obviously I'm always gonna be selling some shit. But I'm gonna be an educator. I wanna tell people about the ins and outs of this business. What to look out for. What do you get graded? What you don't get graded? What to get authenticated? There's a lot of people that just don't know and they have a lot of stuff they're embarrassed. So they give me this opportunity to put a lot of money behind it. Good for you. Very grateful for eBay to give me this opportunity. eBay's iconic. Shout out to eBay. Two iconic people coming together. Brandon Steiner. Steiner Sports was iconic. And especially that Yankee run. It was so legend. You'd be like, I'm like, I gotta get the dirt from Yankee. You were selling everything just as a great house. I think I just got that as a gift. I gave him a pen, by the way. This is like my, you gotta have balls pen for my book. And it has the actual dirt from the last game. This is what I wanted. A Yankee stadium. You can have it. It's all yours. I'll give you another one. No, it's cool. I'll give you one. I'll give you one. I'll have it. I'll give you one. So anyway, Mariano at the last game, he's carrying out this dirt. He gave me half of it. And I filled that up with that. So you got a little Mariano guys. It's a little special. The closer I'm sending you some shit. Is any where you got this? Zeddy Will, Entertainer, artist now. I'm from Queensbridge, New York. You know, I'm 22 years old. I started this entertainment comedy stuff back during COVID. When it was nothing to do, I'm just in the house making videos. Had a first video go viral, hit a million views and from then on, I'm just doing. You were addicted, right? I was addicted. It's like, cause I'm in the house. I'm gonna do. I'm in the crib. I'm making videos. Everybody's loving it. It's got millions of views. And then, you know, I end up getting a two million, three million now of a mass like 12 million follows overall. And now, you know, right now we're getting into the music stuff. I got a song called Cha Cha out. It's going viral. They love it on TikTok. It's popping. It's crazy. You don't like the dance? Come on, do the cha cha. I got to teach you how to dance too before we get out of here. I'm gonna add another song called Freaky with Blue Up. So right now I'm just getting into my music stuff and keeping the comedy alive. And you know, I'm getting a lot of comparisons like Will Smith on the entertainment side. And on the rap side, they calling me like Eminem. And, you know, I'm just having fun with it. I'm just, I'm just living in the moment. So you just say here you're a mix between Will Smith and Eminem. That's a crazy mixture, right? I get it. I'm telling you, but like, when you hear the freestyles, when you hear me rapping and then, you know, as the podcast goes on, you'll get to see more of my personality. I'm just, I'm a vibe. I just be chilling. I'm a hooper, I think. I hoop too. I see you hooper too. Gary, I be dunking on him. I'm trying to. I see you're like he is fucked, bro. I go, hey, I see it. We need you over my house to play, man. I got my wiggie in. This guy does it, my brother plays that. You be open? Hey, Jem, we have to full court. We got full court run. Oh, we can do that. Indoor us. I'd be stunned if you didn't have hops. You look lanky, lanky, lanky. Oh, yeah, I'm 6'3. Yeah, you look. I'm hoping. All right, let's go in a different direction. I'm recruiting you. Boys, let's go vulnerable from the top. What's the thing that you're most struggling with? Real talk, no bullshit. Right now, we're all in very different life cycles. What, you know, what is like the thing? If we were like best friends, and like we had dinner tonight, and we hadn't caught up in a hundred days, and I started with, because look, there's a lot of people watching right now, and like a lot of them would like to have the things that have happened to the four of us happen. And, you know, they'll only see the, it went viral, it was so easy. You just made a couple videos, right? Or, you know, like, well, they did it for a long time. That seems too hard. I don't wanna take 10 years, 20 years to build. We grew up in a world that didn't exist, like these guys were able to have quick moments, and then they had to build something. For us, it was the reverse. We had to build something for a long time, and then you got your moment. So the world's moving, there's a lot going on. Like, in a real way, I feel like this podcast with friends is like people really having a real conversation, especially with like making new acquaintances and strangers. So if I said to you, like, what's the thing that you're most struggling with right now? What is it? Genuinely, it's balancing having a second kid. I have, I mean, blessed two healthy kids. The best of all the things I've done in my life, and I've done some really cool things, and had some difficult times, without question being a father is the best thing I've ever experienced. I think it's peak life. I don't think there's anything better than being a father. It's also difficult. It also takes tolls on other areas of life. And so having zero to one, you're ready for it, you're like, oh, we're having a baby, cool. That's all you're worried about is the one baby. Then that baby is a toddler. And then that has its own challenges, and then you're trying to bring in a second life. So it's like, it's a struggle, yeah. Big kids, big problems. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I spent a lot of time with the OGs, and they've got 40-year-old kids. And you never stop being a parent. When your 59-year-old child has a problem, and you're 83, it's fucking you up, because they're still your fucking child. And so, you know, and so, it's a tough, you're also in a tricky spot. You have more opportunity than you've ever had professionally. You're a young man. Youngish, I'm 36. You're a young man. Thank you. You're a fucking kid, young. You're a young man. You've got nothing but opportunity to build in front of you. You as a human have those feelings, but you've got these other things brewing that are the most important things in life. How do you make it all go? And also feel, at the same time, so lucky that I'm able to say that the thing I'm worried about right now is balancing two kids. You know, I'm like, yeah, I'm super grateful. I mean, I'm a cancer survivor, so that is my perspective. Yeah, it was testicular though, so RIP to the left one. Yep. But still got the right one. The right one's the one you need. That's the only one I need, kind of the kids. But yeah, so I definitely feel grateful that that's the biggest thing going on in my life, but it's still a thing. But it's still your thing. Yeah, it's my thing. Everybody's got their thing. You know, like this is why I always tell people do not envy people that you think have it so great. LeBron and Jay-Z right now are worried about something. And sometimes it's something they're worried about that's way more challenging than what you're dealing with. They may have fame and fortune, but they might have heard someone that they loved the most in the world was diagnosed with not something they were able to win like you were, something they can't win. And it's a wrap. And I promise you, they're more upset today than you are, because you're worried about maybe not having money to get some stuff. But if you have like literally like people not leaning into simplicity is unfortunate, because when you lean into simplicity, you're good. Yeah. So you're actually in a great spot. You're just trying to find balance right now. I'm in a great spot. I'm trying to find balance, balancing, you know, the relationship with your wife also with like having new kids, you know. And trying not to be together next to many times. So I'm lucky to have a great supportive wife. Yeah, it does. You know, there's new dynamics that weren't there before. Yeah. Yes. And it's a beautiful thing to be able to experience something new. Yeah. So I'm grateful for it. Brandon. You know, it's interesting. It's like, okay, my wife has done such a great job with her kids. Like one of my biggest struggles is our kids don't need us. Of course. Like something unbelievable. Like, you know, one man, one man, you can't breathe. You can't get them out of your bed. You can't, you know, you're smothered with them. And the next thing you know is like you're begging and you got to go to these luxurious vacations just to get them for a week to hang out with them. And it's trouble some more from my wife than me. Like I tell them, if you want to help the kids, stop helping them. They don't want your help. What kid really wants help from their parents? You want to do it on their own. And that's exactly how we raised our kids. That's exactly how they're doing it. And sometimes it's hurtful, you know, when you don't hear from your kid now. They've been doing so well on their own. Empty nest shit is tough. It's tough, man. I remember my younger brother, AJ, who was 11 years younger to me, like went away to college. And I wasn't expecting this. Cause I was a young, I was, I was, he was 18, I was 29. This wasn't on my radar. I just started realizing my mom was, and my mom is the happiest, most optimistic. And AJ went to school and I was like, my mom was weird. And I was like, what's going on? And I was like, oh, that's when I learned what empty nest, like she loved being a mom so much. It was her destiny. She is the great, it's the ball time at it. She was sad as fuck that year. Like that was what she loved doing for the last 30 years. That's like parenthood in that nutshell, isn't it? It's like, What I would say to the young ones out there, and that is, if I was going to throw something out there, I said, listen, I know, I know parents are paying the ass, but Brandy, I apologize. Any best just said, where did Gary get that hat? I've got crazy hats coming from V-Friends. This is ambitious angel hat. I love it. Oh, that's cool. What material is that? Cordway, do you get that hat? Nice. Honestly, Brandon, it's so hard to get. Is it? You should be wearing it. You should be wearing it. No, I really figured it out. I'm making so few of them. Is it? Grab those. No, this is very good. You got excited? I'm so excited about this, Brandon. I finally made a cool product. Cause I've made products, but I finally, finally actually did it. Like actually, so anyway, like I'm gonna slowly, but surely, trickle these. Like, I'm so happy right now. That's cool. Anyway, go ahead. You got Flavioz. I was in the stage to sit out there with the young kids and it's like, look, parents are paying the ass, but they know it's gonna be around. Like, you know, you gotta sacrifice in, you know, something you give your, let your parents help you a little bit. It gives them the joy. And you don't have to be so proud sometimes to take their help and advice. I think the other thing that's so troublesome for me is I've had a great Epic run. So really in that little break that I had, like, you know, sometimes you don't realize what you've done, what you've had. It was just so busy grinding. Of course. You ever think you were gonna have like a hit? I was looking around your agency today. It's like, I wonder if Gary was thinking he was gonna have like agency here and Amsterdam, London, like, this outrageous. I did. I feel the same way, but like now it happened though. It's to your point, your point brother, I did, but I'm still grateful as fuck that happened. As confident as, by the way, I think I'm gonna buy the New York Jets. Forget about this bullshit. Like, I'm gonna pull it off. They need you. I'm very aware. But when it happens up to your point, brother, even though I truly believe it's sitting here right now, I will pinch the shit out of myself that day. I will cry. I will, God willing, cause I think it's gonna take me some time. God willing, my parents will be around. Like, but like, it's like. If not, you're the new. You're allowed to have conviction and confidence and yet still have ridiculous humility and gratitude. That's where people get confused. You can have these polar opposite energies. Sure, I have conviction and confidence and bravado, but that doesn't mean that I also don't, I also realize I don't mean shit. Fuck me. If I disappear tomorrow, I'll get a little love on social media for a half a day. People say a little something and then the world has to move on. And so you can have conviction, but if you don't match it with humility, and I get it brother, absolute entrepreneurial, especially East Coast legend. Oh God. It's just doesn't stop. I was telling, I was telling guys outside, like I wake up in the morning and the bathroom is the last thing I'm thinking of going or wake up in the middle of the night. I'm not going to the bathroom. I'm trying to write all the shit that's going on in this brain down. Because there's so many things you can do. And I try to remind myself, and especially now at not being with a big company with all the bosses, I'm on a highway, Gary, with no red lights. The only speed limit is the one I put on myself. Just to give everybody as they're listening. It's crazy. Brandon obviously built this iconic company. He sold it. He's out of multiples. But what he's talking about is when you're in a corporation, you're going slow as fuck. And then when you let an entrepreneur loose, now he's going fast again. And like, by the way, the reason this agency got so big, and we have 2,000 people globally now, it's big, big. But the reason we're winning is, I fight to not be a corporation, even though we are, because we have 2,000 people, we're just a little less than everyone else. And it's like sports. If you're just a little faster, that shit plays out on that court. Just a little faster. John Morant's just a little faster than everybody. I agree with you. Right? It's like not a lot. It's just that inch. It's like, let's talk basketball. Let's talk about some commerce across the board. It's scary how just a little more than everybody else, and it's a completely different game. You're saying that? I always tell people, when you're thinking, how am I gonna outthink you when you're working, and I'll work you, and when you're sleeping, I'll think you and I'll work you. I wouldn't wanna compete with me, because you're shooting for second place. But what's nice is that when you don't realize we need some of these big companies sometimes, is just a million meetings, a million memos, a million that slow you down to drive you crazy. And now, it's funny, at 65, somebody let me out. Now, 65. So I'm enjoying that freedom, but on the flip side, from a problematic standpoint, balancing that, realizing that you can't do all that. You can't kiss all the girls, so to speak. And they're picking my favorite project to work with my favorite people. So I'm able to prioritize, but it's tough because all these opportunities come at you. But it's exciting, and you know something? For anybody who's out there who's a little bit older, shit, do not let anybody dictate when you're dreaming and when you have to stop. I love it. I love it. Is that it? My biggest thing right now, I would say balance, like Gro said, having my comedy and the music. I'm, because of both of this, it's selling for me, so it's a lot going on on both sides. But when you get a song, like I just dropped, and it's doing so well, but the fans still, said, if you want comedy, you want comedy. And I love both, but it's like, I wanna work on what's going on right now. Like I wanna work on what's going on. So you write this, you wanna lean in deeper into the music. But you feel the pressure from the audience, and you wanna deliver for them. Because that's how the fuck you're even sitting here. Exactly. So you're trying to strategize of like fuck, like how do I make sure I don't alienate. By the way, I went through this heavy. The way I popped off back in the day, was in 2006 on YouTube, I started making wine videos. And I did it for five years, every day. And I was the wine guy. Right. And then I wanted to start talking about being who I actually was, which was business. And when I first started making new videos that were not wine, people were not happy. Stay in your lane, wine boy. I'll never forget that quote. Stay in your lane, wine boy. Right. That's what I'm much worse. That's what I, oh yeah. This was 10 years ago, people were nicer. It's like a good thing and a bad thing. Cause it's like wine guy, oh, you've made so big of a name. They know you for something, but then it's like, when you try to get out. Well, this goes back to this, honestly, yours is a lot more simple than those two. To me, you have to die on your sword in life. The reason I'm always happy, is I have tons of shit that don't go well. It's just that I always make decisions that I want to make. The only times in my life that I've been really upset is when I listened against my own intuition to something I perceived was gonna give me better advice. A parent, a mentor, someone I looked up to randomly was just in a motley. By the way, I haven't done it a whole lot. I have to go way back in my bank because some were pretty quickly, real quickly in my life. I was like, fuck this shit. If I'm gonna lose, I'm losing on my shit. So for you, even just the way you said it, if that's so obvious to me, you need to go hard on this music kick. And if you wake up in a year and your audience is declining, the music has not pumped, popped off, and you realize, fuck, I might've fucked up. I might've, should've went harder on comedy or I should've done both for a minute. Here's the good news. He's a baby. You're still in the fucking belly. 22. 22. I've never been called a baby yet. That's good. If you literally fuck up the next 24 months and you guys are like, damn, we really like fuck. We missed our moment. No, you didn't. You didn't fully capitalize on your moment, yet you can change that the next day. The next day. And so I think for you, if I may, one man's point of view is if that fucking music is pulling at you, just go hard because here's the problem. If you don't in a year and you're kind of in both, but the music didn't go to where it's at, or you're kind of dreading the comedy and you start resenting the comedy, you're not gonna be in a good place because you knew what you wanted to do, but you didn't, all these fucking people living for the algorithm, bro. Living for the algorithm grails. I experienced something similar where it's like, I know if I do a video that's like, my son be like, it's gonna do really well. I don't find that funny. So I have to balance doing stuff that I think is funny that sometimes isn't gonna perform as well, but I know if I'm always trying to do what I know does well, I know what's shareable, anytime a dad does dad humor, it does well. But that's not always what I wanna do. So I just try to balance it. I have no idea if it works or not, but for me, I just don't wanna look at something. You know, when that came, there's so many people right now. Dude, I had this, I bring this analogy up and it came through the other night. I read a lot of DMs, which has always given me a pulse of the feelings. This dude's like, yo, I really, really, really wanna talk about science, but I'm a trainer and the only post that do well is when I take my shirt off and show my abs. And this is a dude, not like we think about it from the female perspective more often. And I'm like, bro, you're unhappy. Host your science video. I understand it's not gonna get 30,000 likes and it's gonna get 600, but who gives a fuck? That's what you wanna do. And also eventually it will. If you keep doing it, yeah, like eventually. You took the words out of my mouth. That was gonna be my segue. And it's not sustainable when it's not right for you. Like it's a losing game. It's why I see so many people losing. They milk the thing that got them there for a year or two after they didn't like it anymore. And it gets stuck. And the audience can smell it. If you're not about that life, you're not about, the streets don't fuck with a lot of rappers because they know that the rapper is no longer living that life. Right, right. And some stay there because they're actually in it. The streets, a classic rap term, but it's a macro business term. The streets don't fuck with people because they can smell it when it becomes no longer authentic. And if you're still doing this shit that always works for you, there's a million. I've sucked for the last year on YouTube. I just don't wanna do the things that I know will work better right now. I'm busy building my company. By the way, I'm doing this because I need to get back into Gary Vee life. The last year, I've been just sitting in his office for 15 hours a day because I'm entrepreneur first, personalities. Because you've been kinda quiet. Yeah. In my view. Working 100%. I feel like you've been kinda quiet. I've been quiet building a fucking foundation for the next chapter. And I'm like incredibly happy about that. Me too, man. I'm in the same boat. I don't need, if I want credit, I go to the bank. I don't need the attention. Yeah. I love it. I'm flying right underneath the radar, doing my thing. And I don't really give a shit what anybody else thinks about it. I'm already aware that there'll be 2031. I'll be hot again, 2032. I'll be quiet. I'm not worried about it. I'm worried about doing good things. There's gonna be ebbs and flows. Listen, I have a 15 year track record. I promise you, I will be one of the fucking people that pops off on whatever the next TikTok is. It's who I am. And I'll be making videos. And because so many people didn't listen to me on TikTok last time, this next time everyone's gonna really go. I remember when you were saying that. Whenever you decided to do people gonna, I wouldn't be in social media at the level I'm at without you. I remember. I was completely lost. And somebody in my office like, you gotta fuck off, I went to see some speech. I was doing the opening, you were one of the keynotes. And I was like, who the fuck is this guy? I'm like, I guess I better stop listening. And I'm like, this shit's making sense. And then I got really into my social. Cause you know, again, my friends are like, we're not doing Instagram, we're not doing Facebook, we're not doing this. I'm like, no, I'm doing it. Back to my Pokemon Sesame Street. This is very cool shit, man. So this is Be Friends, my Pokemon meets Sesame Street friend. I want you to open the pack and look at all four cards and tell me which character most resonates for you. And then we'll go around the horn. Isn't this called a rip? Is this called a rip? Is this a rip or a rip in it? I did this like three weeks ago for the first time ever in my life. I had that. There you go. Resonates the most. Yep. He's a nice. I gotta go. I got mine. All right, Chris. All right, I'll go with selfless sloth. Keeping with the parent vibe. Okay, so I just traveled with a toddler and a baby. It's great, but I just, I have to tell you, breaking down a stroller with people behind you in like a security line and nobody has patience that you're a parent. No one cares. They just need to go where they're going is one of the most stressful things. We got through it, but I almost bit someone's head off. Okay, I'm going with selfless sloth. Cause you're leaning into that in your life. I'm leaning into that. I think it's just hot in my mind right now. Yeah, for sure. I think as a parent, your life immediately, and it's again, the best thing ever, becomes about other people. I think it's a really happy way to live also. I think about John Wood and what's like a life that's not lived in service to others isn't a life worth living. I don't know if that's a quote. I just made that up. You can write that down if you want I thought that was pretty good. Put down the notes. Did anybody get a foil? Did everybody get just yellow cards? I got yellow. No foils suck. Yellow cards. So I'm going to go with that. Yeah, and I'm with sloths. I dig sloths. So I'll stick with that. Brandon? I don't know why, but I'm liking this brilliant. Barracuda? Oh, Barb. The behind. I like it. The finish. Happy, ready to roll, just moving right along. Do you find yourself brilliant? I find myself at this point, I look back on, you know, Brandon, because I always thought I was not that smart, having really struggled to read, struggle, half illiterate, the whole work. And now I'm like, you know, Brad, it's a pretty smart shit you did. I give myself a little more credit for you. I gotta interrupt this program. I'm really happy. I really like the relationship you have with yourself. We've pointed out a lot. I'm really happy that I feel like you're really getting into a nice place with yourself. Yeah, I mean, it's tough. When you're fighting the fight and grinding, trying to get numbers, you don't always get your best self out. And that's what you gotta avoid, because it's really all about the relationships and about loving what you do and making sure you love the people at home. So I'm very grateful and my wife keeps me straight, which is, you know, my wife was hung in with a lot of my bullshit, so I'm very grateful. And thank you for saying that. I appreciate that. I feel it, it's cool. You're a vibe, you're a vibe, Brandon. Thank you. I'm young. You're a vibe. Thank you, man. You be chilling, you happy. Yeah, thank you. That's not a lot of that. Vibes cha cha, what do you got? I got Curious Crane. That's me. You're curious. I'm always, I always wanna learn something. I always wanna learn something new. I feel like, cause all my life growing up, I always thought I knew everything. That was one thing my mother always said, you think you know it all, you're a cat with corn. Cause you have conviction. Probably so. Right, cause that's, I wanna break this down. Cause I think it's a strength. But to your point, being a know it all and being, if you don't, if you have conviction, cause you knew yourself, you knew you had it, without humility, right? So the reason they're called V-Friends is some of them work together. So here is Humble Hummingbird, right? So Humble Hummingbird with conviction cockroach, that's the game. You have conviction, but if somebody says some shit, you have to have the humility to be like, oh fuck. I thought I knew, but I did it. Conviction's beautiful. That's happened a lot. I like, I had it happen a lot. But yeah, and I definitely curious, I'm always learning, I always wanna know something new now. Cause I feel like I don't know it all. And when I feel like I don't, well, when I feel like I do know it all, something always goes wrong for me. And I feel like, you know, you gotta go through that sometimes. You gotta go through humility, but you're staying curious. I'm pretty, I've been doing pretty good. I'm pretty good. Were you a good student in high school? No, I was bad. I was a bad kid. I was a class clown. Was anybody here a good student? Cause I was a class clown. And now my teachers are calling me, oh my God, my kids love you. They watch this stuff on the top. That was the worst. Pull up down from the top. The sign, the sign, the report, grab it. Take that down. I love that. Take it down. I got a bunch of passes in my head. Put it in the middle. You want to see some shit? Look at this girls. Oh great. Oh my goodness, look at that. Break it down. Tell them. Give them some highlights. There's nine, 10, 11, 12th grade. Oh, I can't, I was waiting, cause we probably got to see you crazy. Give them some highlights, girls. You gotta see in ceramics, which I'll give you. How do you get into seeing ceramics? See in English? That's all that, right here. Algebra 1D, IPS, I'm not sure what that is, irritable, biosensor maybe. You gotta see in that speech, you got a D. Hold on. In speech, giving speeches in class, I got a D. That was my only A by the way. I am one of the 100 most well compensated public speakers in the world currently, and I got a D in speech. Keep going. Let's give you some highlights. You got an A. Give them German 1 freshman year. Yeah, German, you got an F. You got an F in German. That was 9th grade. Now on the bottom there, this is 9th grade German, this is 10th grade German. Tell them what I got in German 1 sophomore year. A F again. Okay, so just so everybody knows, in Jersey, in Jersey, you have to pass. You have to pass. Should we go on to Spanish? Language. You have to pass language. Two years in New Jersey to graduate high school. Same thing. I come out the gate freshman year, I take German because I was born in Russia, and thought they would be similar. Like an idiot. F. I run it back on some, yo, fuck that bullshit. I'm coming back, I'm getting a D in this shit. I run it back. A D. So then junior year, I have to go take Spanish 1 with fucking 8th graders as a junior, what I got? Junior and Spanish 1, you got a D. So you passed. You passed, I got a D. You said one reason. Big shout out, Senora Kennedy, the only teacher in my life that saw me, called my mom and said, I'm just gonna pass your son. He doesn't even know what Ola means. What Ola means now? Hello. I bet. What'd I get in Spanish to my senior year? Spanish to senior year, he moved it up to a D, which is the exact same. No no, dogs is D2Ds. D2Ds. Yeah, it's the same thing with me. With French, my mother had to come up and beg the teacher to pass me. Affin pre-count. Affin pre-count. I couldn't learn French. Check this class rank. Same thing. What is my class rank? Class rank in four years out of 254 students, you are 243. That's cold. I wonder how many of those. Yo, that's right. I wonder how many it owns. How many of the 242, what are they doing now? What are they doing, exactly. Yo, knife grade me. If I was watching this. Where'd you go to high school? And I seen that, I'd be like, oh yeah, I got hope. I got hope. Well this is why, by the way, I appreciate you saying this. That's hope. That's literally what I'm, you know what I'm doing before actually, the parents. The kids. Don't get caught up in this. The kids, man. The reason we just did that was for the parents that are watching and the ones that are listening at home. I am remarkably happy. Fuck my professional success. My mom built me. I am gloriously happy as a human being. I'm very blessed. I'm clearly professionally successful as well, which is secondary, but still matters. And this was, this thought that there's any correlation. And by the way, then when people are on the other side, like Gary, that's okay, but you're an enigma. No, no, I'm not an enigma. I'm aware that not everybody reaches my level of happiness and success. But I know unlimited straight A valedictorians that can't, the career students, that they can't pull it off in the real world. I know tons of people. All four of us are bad at school. All four of us are chopping up right now. Like school is fine and it works. And by the way, it matters for many people people learn different ways. I just don't think we realize that half the people, half, don't learn the way this whole system's built. That's half the people. I would have conversations in like parent-teacher conference and I'd be like, your kid is annoying in my class, but he's also really funny and really personable. So I have to tell you, yes, he's annoying and it's disrupting the class, but I said it nicer than that. But like also remind him like, that could be the strength that makes him successful and whatever he does after this. Him being personable and coming to my class and smiling puts a smile on my face. And while he's at my neck, I'm at his neck. But hey, the school you coached at, my mother was smart enough to realize put me in a pass for high school. So I got caught up in the learning, not worrying about the grades. And then I'm going to Syracuse, which is my friend still like, where you going up the Cues? What's going on up there? I'm like, is that a SUNY? I'm going to Syracuse, never going back. My mother said, look, we're so poor. These are what I raise, have no grades, no money, 760 on my boards combined. I almost got a zero on the English. I go home, I'm crying like, mom, the guidance counselor tells me I shouldn't go to college, I should go to a trade school. I can't use the language, there's so foul of my mother laying off. She's going to go up and beat the shit out of the guidance counselor. Mom, you can't go up there. She says, I want you to go get that book. I want you to find the most expensive school in New York state. That's who's going to give us the most aid. So how are we going to afford it? We got no money. Nobody's going to have the balls that has your grades. You look, you've been working for 10 years. You got to go up and make a sale. I have the Syracuse made a sale. That's amazing. That's tough. They're crazy. As moms for you, though. Yeah, I always say moms are the most important people in the world. They mean the most. And they have the biggest impact. Of course, it's actually very common, sensical. You come out of them. Facts. I love what people are like, try to argue. Let me end this discussion immediately. You were once inside of her. You know what's saying that is? Like, we don't think about it because it's just so mon... I'm going to say it nice and slow. Of course they are. You were in there. You, this is like the most basic. I don't understand it. People don't understand it. This is how you started. Let me tell you where you all started. In there. From the womb. In your mama. Of course they're the most important. It's so funny when people are like, I don't know. I'm like, the music, the influence. You think pop culture is more important than the place you came from. You came the fuck out of them. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Fuck you. It's true, that's very basic and true. Right, basic is why I won. This was all complicated bullshit. By the way, can you just tell everybody the only A's I got in all four of my years of my life today? You have an A on... Freshman year. Fizzed. Okay, then. Gym class A, freshman year, second year. Fizzed again. I'm not sure what Northwest world is, but you gotta be in it. Is that history? History. History was the one thing I listened to. Did you have a cool teacher that told fun stories? No, yeah, we had good teachers everywhere and bad teachers. It was just that I never knew why it was good in history until I got older. I use history to tell me the future. It's more, yeah. Everything old is new again. And so it's, I didn't realize it was my obsession with pattern recognition and human behavior. Like why did, was there a war? Why did we go to Vietnam? The why. So A and gym, freshman, sophomore, junior year. My only A was in. Junior, Fizzed again. And then you got two. You got health and Fizzed. Yeah, it was a gym. Legend Michael, I was in, bro. I was in jail, if you know what it was. You know what we called me? A gym class hero. I would go to gym class. Like it was game seven of the NBA finals. People were like warming up. I'm like, I'm trying to kill people. Like I, it was the most important thing for me in the world I don't know how to not compete. Like they're like, all right, gym class, we're gonna play. I'm like, I'm trying to kill you. And that's when you could play fun games like dodgeball. I feel like you can't even play that now. Cause like people get, you know, you can't hurt someone. You can't hit me in my head. No, you don't play dodgeball. Yeah, I know. Hit me in my head. And we used to play dodgeball with the rubber balls that like bounce off you, not the like foam ones. Not to let the foam ones. Yeah, we needed the foam ones. What has been the thing this year where we're, by the way, 8% of 2024 is over. Just to get the people that need a little motivation. It really fucks with me. Yeah, right? Didn't that hit you? It's fucked up when you say it that way, right? Damn, I got a lot of it. Right? 8% is over, right? If I wait. It's 8%. January was the longest year ever. 8% but on that note, 2024 is here now. What has been the thing you've seen in the last month that's been interesting? A person, a trend, an app, a brand, anything in the first month of the year. And by the way, if you want to go back a couple months to the end of last year, in the last 100 days or so, what's caught your attention? Give it some thought. Anything that's caught your attention, a person, a trend, a movement, anything. What has caught your attention in the game called pop culture? I already know one who's a creator. I'll go with the creator since that's, I guess that's what I am. There's this girl, Veronica is cool. Big shout out. Is just the funniest person. I got on her early. Like she had probably 60,000 followers on TikTok. She has been blowing up the past like two or three months I'd say. It is just one of the funniest, most creative and weird and hilarious comedic skit people I've seen. Just like, you know when you watch something and it's so funny to you that you can't even laugh because your mouth is open. You're like, what did I just watch? That's the kind of funny she is. That's awesome. I've been digging her stuff. I'm glad you gave her some flowers, she's crushing. Brandon? You know what's interesting to me is people dying to get out. I just, you know, you go to any event, any concert. I've done Q&As, I haven't done it a while but I want to bring experientials back because most of my customers asking. I said, I don't know, people are gonna come out. So, I mean, just did like a quick air and moon Q&A. The manager of the Yankees like sold out in like 15 minutes. People want to get out and want to get back to meeting people, getting around people which is very promising. And I think that trend's gonna be strong. I mean, you go to most concerts, games, packed. So, people want to get out and if you're out there you have the ability to create situations for people to get out, it's good. And you know, having your people go back to work is such a, that's another issue. I've been in the office every day with my staff but this is the hybrid thing. I'm a fan of it. You know, maybe you're gonna work three, four days at least but I think you're doing a disservice to yourself. I realize some people can work great from home but I think getting in the office is healthy and you shouldn't avoid it. Yeah, being in your home by yourself 24 sevens. It's got some things. I agree with you. The real life stuff is very obvious to me as well. The real life experiential, real life events. People are, it's happening. Like the most important, oh, the most thing I've seen is kind of wild to me is Snapchat. Now I think I know Snapchat now is different from than the one it was. Like now, you know, people got these gold stars and they posted their life all day long. Like you get paid for Snapchat and they had a vlog and but like, if I'm seeing Dwayne O'Rock Johnson on Snap and I'm able to see all the behind the scenes of his life and then you know, I'm having this talk with the Snapchat reps and stuff and they're like, you get a whole different fan base on the Snapchat. 100%. I didn't know that. I'm a big TikTok Instagram guy. So I'm with YouTube shorts. I am, my man's always telling me, you got a post on YouTube shorts. I didn't know how big of a thing that was. Like I'm getting into it. You need to do everything. That's what I'm trying to get into. This is the point, the book before we went live when you talk about Jeff Giabbrite Hook, the book I wrote. That was like, here are the platforms that matter. Here's the content that's working. So I have a- Don't overthink it. I have a new book coming out called Day Trading Attention. And I mean, someone like you, I mean, you, by the way, you know where your shit would go crazy? Where? Facebook. Yup. I know. Wow. You're the fourth person out in Tomida. My shit goes crazy on Facebook. I'm like some old geezer. Of course your shit goes crazy. You're fucking heartthrob to those 80 year old fucking women. Oh my God. They're like, this young boy is amazing. I was checking on all your Instagram right there. People going crazy, but that was fun. Yeah. Bro, the number one thing you need to do out of this podcast is go home and realize, okay, I've been bullshitting. I need to do YouTube shorts proper. I'm real proud of you. Because Snap is the one that everybody misses. I've been killing it. Snap is real shit. Snap, YouTube shorts is incredibly, YouTube shorts is TikTok, but you won't get as much reach up front, but long term because people search, and then it leads to your main channel. That is like oxygen. I gotta go on this myself. I just didn't know if shit. And Facebook? Facebook, first of all, a couple things that people don't realize. The amount of 20 to 30 year olds that are on Facebook still, they're not going 18 hours a day, like they're on TikTok, but they're going. But nobody contemporary is making shit for it. So they're just, it's the same shit as Snap. All this is day trading attention. Where's there more attention than people that are good making content? There's the arbitrage. The reason I went crazy about TikTok five years ago was I was on it when it was musically, and I was just waiting and waiting. And then there was a tipping point two years before COVID where I was like, oh fuck, it's there. And so I got loud because I was winning, but I wanted other people to win. And so that's what's always going on. I mean, that is imperative. And then finally live streaming. Twitch, yeah, Twitch. Twitch, and even better than Twitch, actually, because Twitch is hard. Like I only have 500 people watching right now. You have to build up over time. I've gotta earn it. It's gonna be a grind. TikTok Live. TikTok Live puts you into fucking people's feeds while you're on. So on Instagram, you go on, it pings all your users, and a certain percentage comes over, and then it declines. So depending on your audience side, for me it's like 2000, come on right away. And then five minutes later from Yap, and I look up in the corner, it's 800. It declines, because my crew gets pinged, they check it out, they're like, I don't give a fuck what Gary's doing, they're out. TikTok, you go on, pings. And that's right. And so you start, you look over, there's 600, and then you look an hour later, you weren't even doing anything proper, and there's 4,000 people there. Because they keep, so, and here's the big thing, I'm saying to you three, and obviously I'm saying it for everyone at home, who's watching live now, and who's watching, listening on the podcast in the next weeks or a year from now. The key is to day trade attention. When something's there, you gotta squeeze it, cause it's not always there. All those fuckers didn't jump to TikTok when I was saying it, cause they had a nice little gig on Instagram, and they were nice and cozy, getting their thousand likes there, and they felt good about their self-esteem, because on TikTok they had no followers. The problem was, once the attention moved, all, winning on Instagram now is hard. Supply and demand, the end. Heard? You right now in this hot moment, are you fucking kidding me? YouTube shorts, Facebook? Chass has something new, Instagram Reels. Yeah, Reels are great, but it's, listen, this is what I do for a living, I'm not even going by my content. This company spends billions of dollars in advertising, that makes millions of pieces of ads a year, like I can see the whole, it's not, I'm in it, and I'm that guy, I'm proud of how good I am at it, but I have much more data than everybody. Like this is like, Instagram's great, it's harder. If you do the same effort on Instagram, that you would do on Facebook, Snap, YouTube Shorts, or TikTok, you will get more on all four of those than Instagram. Instagram is the established social network right now. Not like unbelievable amounts of content put on on Instagram, with a heavy percentage, every minute that somebody spends on TikTok today, was an Instagram minute five years ago. It's fair. Gere, do you think that's why, it seems like Instagram is more valuable. If you have a lot, you can have, if you have a, I'll put it this way, I know people who have million, a million followers on TikTok and aren't really monetized, if you have a million followers on Instagram, you're caked. Different bullies. When you say monetized, ads from the platform? I just mean they're not getting a lot of brand deals, yeah, they're not getting, and so like, how come? That's because the decision makers and corporations are behind the times. Yeah. So a million followers isn't as valuable to brands as 500,000 Instagram followers. For another 24 months and then it will flip. The problem is, go get a million followers on Instagram. Yeah, I'm gonna weigh. It's hard. It's very hard. It's very hard. TikTok, you'll want it in a month. Your clothes are in a month. I'm at 500K, 500K. He could decide he wants to, and if he did, then you're trading your own attention. If he wanted to get to a million, he could. He would just decide for the next three weeks to go ham on TikTok and push everyone to Instagram, maybe do a contest. Everybody follow me there. I'm gonna pick three of you and have dinner tonight in the city. Guess what, that 550 will be 730 tonight. But he might not want to, because followers aren't the same anymore. The social media I grew up with was email marketing. You would get a million followers and then 35% of certain percentage of them would see it. Now, there's people, I got 15 million followers in TikTok. There's people on their first post getting more views on that video than me, because the content is the variable, not how many followers you have. All of us stopped following people, because the algorithm sends it to us. So they're like, oh, I like this Gary Vee stuff, but then I'll say it again. You don't think the way we did six years ago, you follow. This is a real fucking game. It's about how many likes you have on your TikTok page. Engage me and not engage me. It all changes, guys. Watch time. Watch time. Shares. Right now on Instagram, it's shares. This is what I spent on. Shares is the call to action there. So it just, oh, and by the way, and then three months, Instagram might want something else to be the thing and TikTok this. So this is real fucking shit. All right, going back around the other way. As a kid, let's give some flowers. Who was your idol as a kid? Or who was, if you can think of one person that you just thought was the fucking greatest, I'll go first, Don Mattingly. Don Mattingly from the New York Yankees first baseman. The Yankees sucked in my era. The 80s, the Yankees were bad. Donnie baseball. Donnie baseball. You're gonna be with them on Sunday. I love them, please send them my love. By the way, should I be dialing you? Should I dial you up when I'm with them? Are you supposed to do a card? I don't think you do a card. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, thank you, thanks. Thank you, brother. Yeah, of course. Keep you around. Come back. Protective Panther. I'll tell you why. I've had a great first month of the year. My sister and I are communicating via text and calls at FaceTime so much in the first month compared to like even last seven years. We always chop it up and we're very, very close. But I feel like we're like, it's really nice. Like I would say we're very close, but I think like this month has been remarkable. Like we're just locked in. You know what, you know how it is, right? With relationships. So I'm feeling great about it, but it was funny when I looked at the cards, it tapped into a feeling I was so protective of my sister growing up. Cause I was an 80s kid and you went outside. Yeah. And I was going outside when I was eight. She was five and we were outside and mom don't get mad, but my mom didn't know where to fuck we were. It was the 80s. Nobody knew what the fuck. Parents are all freaked out on this. When I was nine years old, my mom had no fucking clue where I was. And I was outside somewhere. Also was outside. It was outside, bro. And by the way, outside when I was nine, in 1984, meant we were on the railroad tracks on some standby me shit. We were fucking hitting. We used to have a game called, we would have a game called sticks where any one of us, this 10 kids is our crew. We'd be like sticks, you know what it meant? You need to pick up a stick and hit each other. This happens when there's no phones. There's a fine shit to do in here. You can't record any of this. It's running across the street fucking cars whizzing by on some like, like we were like little kid Frogger. Like it was, like it was. So anyway, because of that though, your instincts, I was protecting my sister constantly. I thought I was grown at 11 and she was eight. I gotta take care of her. And so protective Panther hit me in this pack of like, I loved being protective. I learned how to be a leader because of my sister. I was built for who I ended up becoming because I got the training and the trenches for my sister. And now you reconnected. I wanna make a very clear connection. I just feel like for the first time in a long time, we have a great connection. I have an amazing relationship with my sister consistently. It feels like it leveled up for some reason and it's so fun for me. Like it feels so warm and homey and amazing and delicious and the best. I feel like five years ago or something or maybe three years ago, you were like follow. If I ever gave you a value, follow her. And I shot her follow. So I see all her real estate stuff. She's killing it. If you wanted my house in Jersey, hit up Liz Nivello. Liz Nivello. Liz Nivello. All right, your turn. Man, Jim Carrey. Okay. I love Jim Carrey as a kid. I'm still a dude to this day. I just feel like he was so himself. That's one of the people I idolized. Like when it comes to telling my fans and telling people who know me, I like being myself. I like the way I am. By the way, I apologize for brother. Cade91671 says, I don't fuck with Gen X. I just wanna talk about this for a half a second if I may. Not sure. The world is very bad at something. It's called, we have found more and more ways to not like each other. Facts. You agree? Right? Religion is well documented. It's been a problem for 10,000 years. Race, well documented. Gender, unfortunately. Boys versus girls. It ebbs and flows, but not well documented. We have done such a good job. And that's me saying we've done a bad job. We have allowed 8 billion humans on earth to continuously find things on gender, race, income level, country. I'm American. I Italy hate spate. Country and the fact that we have now crossed over into another one, which is called generational hate. The fact that boomers hate Gen Z and Gen Z hates Gen X. And the fact that a human would type, I don't fuck with Gen X. By the way, I'm in Gen X. We don't even get talked about. I'm just pumped to even mention Gen X. It's millennials, boomers, Gen Z. I don't even know if people know Gen X exists. I didn't even know what Gen X was, honestly. There you go. Yeah. The fact that we're in this place where we are continuously looking to find another thing to hate each other about drives me fucking crazy. You're diggling us. Yeah, that's corny. It's stupid. The whole thing fucking sucks. Anyway, go ahead. Yeah, no, sorry. Jim Carrey, he just saw himself. And I used to try to, still to this day, I try to find ways to look up Jim Carrey interviews because I just want to see him talk. I want to see the things, like how did he grow up? How was his relationship with his family? Like he's just, from eighth Ventura, my favorite movie's The Mask from The Grinch. Like I just love Jim Carrey. And it was always awkward to my mom. She was like, Jim Carrey, like, you love Jim Carrey like that? And even now, I get on interviews and they say, who's someone you love? I love Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is the man. Brandon? Well, I was really lost and I have a dad and all that stuff. And I go to this summer camp to work. And I was a dishwasher. And I went to this guy, Alzi Jackson. He's a big black man, very large. And I say to him, Alzi, here you have a training program. He goes, and he's like, white boy, you can sharpen my knives and we'll see how that goes. So every morning I go, I'm there, crack it down. I'm sharpening the guy's knives. At some point after about two weeks, he's like, stay away from my knives. There's been no knives left. There's been no knife left. So I was just sharpening them all day. And he took me under his wing and actually taught me how to cook. And he was just incredible. Like a dad to me, just taught me everything, told me the truth. I'm like the opposite about whatever that person was talking about with Gen Z. Like this guy took me under his wing, told me the truth, told me all the things I needed to know and learn about. How old were you? Started at about 16. Amazing. And this guy, besides teaching me how to cook soups, he just worked for Campbell, he was a hat maker. But this guy, I'll just tell you a quick story. This guy, we're making Chinese food one day. Me and this guy, Sach, everybody had a nickname growing up. So we're cooking this Chinese food, fried rice, our balls are on fire, the ovens are right underneath. And we get in at 5.30 in the morning, cooking. So this was an easy meal. We cooked everything in the morning, afternoon, we take a few hours off, come back for dinner. So we get off to work, it's like 100 degrees out, we're just killing ourselves. Go get a beer. We go back to the room, we have like an hour left, we have to go back and we take a little nap. Sach comes running in my room, go wake up, wake up. There was a fire, he goes, we missed dinner. It's 10 to 7. You know, to help at 5.15, the camp at 6 o'clock. We go in the kitchen and we start yelling and screaming, pots are throwing. I'm going around the kitchen saying, you let us sleep through the meal, your future in this kitchen is uncertain. I mean, you may not make it. I don't know if you're going to make the summer. And he's like, my buddy, Sach is like, you black, you, man, you're the, so at some point, as he had enough, he calls us to get us out of the kitchen, just for creating a ruckus, pots are flying, and we're like, that's serious. And Sach is physically getting removed from the kitchen with two people, he won't leave. Because we let, the guys let us sleep through the kitchen. So on the way out, I'm near the door, I go, I'll see you. Why don't you wake us? And he just gives me this green, he goes, I started to give you the night off. And I think about it's like we're 17 years old, working 100 some hours a week, and we're pissed off because he gave us the night off. And that's the kind of pride, like that's what he instilled. Maybe I'll say, we didn't get your work ethic from Mike. I'm like, you know, unbelievable. You don't know, I believe that people are placed in your life, you know, to run it to him and I never went to college, it wasn't for him. It's amazing. Never, no way. He's like, you got to go to college and explain how to do it, how it all worked. So you know, you're very, very fortunate. I love that. Yeah. Shout out to him. Yeah, I think I've had like different heroes at different stages of life. Like different things I've been doing. I've said I had great parents growing up, so. That's awesome. And great friends, you know, friends, parents that were really, really pivotal in my life too. Professionally, I really, really looked up to Jay Wright. I love that. As a coach, yeah. I love Jay Wright. Jay Wright was the coach of Villanova. Okay. Yeah, he won two national championships. As a Knicks man, we're basically Villanova now. We're Villanova, I'm a Knicks guy too. So. Here we go, man. Jaylin Brunson went to my high, I should say I went to his high school now. He was after me though, but yeah. So professionally him, now like comedy wise, big Adam Sandler fan. I feel like the world just needs a movie that's just like a feel good. You know he's gonna win the golf championship at the end. Just give us happy Gilmore. Like why is everything so complicated nowadays? So yeah. Because in life we find what we look for. Yeah. And we've just decided to start looking for the negative. Meanwhile, the world is unlimited positive. Yeah. It's everywhere around you. The problem is humans see what they're looking for. Yeah. It's just the biggest truth. Yeah. This is something I'm so passionate about, brother. If you decide to look for positivity, there's unlimited positive everywhere. Thanks. You got vibes everywhere. I think even in comments like you and I experience it and Gary you too. And I'm sure you being on the internet, it's like you'll get hate comments. Of course. I mean I didn't even know I had a weird neck until I got on the internet. I was like oh I guess I have a weird neck. All right, all right. And weird teeth. I think I have a long neck. I think it's just cool. It looks athletic and good. I like your neck. I mean I've been putting on some weight. Yeah. That's good. You look like you're taking a shot from the face. Thanks man. I wish you had that neck. Take a punch. But I think it's more just kind of like the mouth melts into the, you know, there's not much. I wish I could do like. That seems like you could do some crazy stuff. So that looks like it's good content. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. I basically did that in every video. Let me just get that. I basically just do this and breathe in my videos. Yeah, you're one. That's like. You're not right. It was random though. I didn't see that coming. I think I just. Jared, it was awesome. I'll give a quick story, really quick story. I went to go see a practice when I was coaching at York. And see a practice at J-Rite. He was coaching. Yeah. I was coaching basketball. And I, he was able to hold a kid accountable. A really a five star recruit. He was able to hold this kid accountable without screaming. And I was like a young coach. And I was like, I was a screamer. I was like, oh, you know, tough kids. I was in Brooklyn. You know, do we were walking through metal detectors? So I was like, I'm not one. Get your ass over there. I think I'm coach Carter or whatever it is. And you realize that like you don't need. I just want such a valuable lesson. I apologize. You know the only time it was ever universally booed on stage because I've had a very good public speaking career was at the height of his popularity at South by Southwest. I said, fuck Steve Jobs. I never want to be like him. And people were. Boo, boo. Crazy, really? And I said, let me explain myself. I'm like, all of you in Silicon Valley now are being mean to employees because the stories are out that he's tough and not nice. It's corny. And all of you are trying to be not nice. Yeah. And I was trying to set the tone for who I am now. Even back then of like, I believe who you are as a person. How people talk about you behind your back. It's important. It's way important. It's the only thing. It's not even a fuck how much money you made. Fuck you. Who gives a fuck? Do you know any rich people die and three people show up to their funeral? You think that's a good life? The fuck's a matter of people? The fuck are we spitting hate for? You hating someone? When people leave negative comments on my account, I feel bad for them. Yeah. I don't feel bad for me. Especially when they're fathers. You imagine living life going around trying to make other people feel bad. And they're fathers. Your shit's not funny. Gary, this is okay. I probably was in three minutes later already. I gotta get the fuck out of here. I wanna say one quick thing. One second. One. Ask permission if you before you kill somebody to let them know what your intent is. That you're gonna, you know, you want them to be great and it's not personal. So if I kill you, it's just to make you better. And have that in a really normal conversation. Some believe how many employees now say it's okay. You can get crazy with me. I'm asking you permission to do it. So this way what I'm doing it, there's no one coming from. And honestly, I'm in the J-Rite school. Like to me, you guys know this. Dustin, we've been together how long? Five and a half years. You've filled me constantly. How many times have you seen me yell at someone? Why? You can get the point. For what? And by get it, we've all got, my father yelled at everyone. I get it. I'm just, and by the way, that's beautiful. Like, hey, but like it has no positive effect. Like that's your unhappy. That's your own weakness. That's you reflecting. Anyway, I love you all. Thank you for being here. Thank you so much. This is really awesome. Keep it on the brink of love. Thanks, guys. Bye, everybody. Love you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye, everybody. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
