My big thing is that I genuinely don't think most things matter. And so, I'm very big on lack of ego is why I'm good at delegating. I actually think way too many people suck at delegating because they're egotistical and they don't deploy enough humility and they actually are micromanaging out of their own insecurities. And so, it's very easy for me to delegate because I trust people and I trust them up front. You know, my dad always says, you've got to earn my trust and I always say, I'm giving you trust and you've got to lose it and actually it's kind of hard to lose. I think that's allowed me to go fast. It's allowed me to scale. I think it's a differentiator and I don't think anything can really cripple me and so I give them the room. I think delegation has a lot to do with ego and insecurities and I watch and I'm able to do a lot of things by giving people room and to me, if I'm doing 97 things and 97 people are helping me and they're all ranging from if a 10 was perfect execution from a 4.2 to a 9.7, doing 97 things from a 4.2 to a 9.7 is a hell of a lot better than doing one or two things at a 10.0. It's a net score game and that's how I'm wired and that's how I strategize and then as people prove that they can do 9.2, 8.7 work, I move them up and if they prove they can do 11.0 work, I remind them that maybe you should be doing something up for themselves. So that's the bottom line.
