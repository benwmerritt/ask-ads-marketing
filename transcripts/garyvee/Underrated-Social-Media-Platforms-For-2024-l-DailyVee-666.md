Meanwhile, six hours into a live stream. Guess in the comments, my fastest growing platform right now. So a lot of LinkedIn answers the answer to the question and it's not even close. I did trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life documented. Really thinking about streaming all day, just seeing the true day to day. I think there's something cool about this in the background for eight hours straight and I'll unmute and try to give a little tidbit. This is very alpha, alpha, alpha, not even beta yet, but I think this could be very valuable. For everyone, even the worst acting citizen on this call, I'm prepared to help them get a job, not at VaynerMedia, that pays them more than they get paid right now at VaynerMedia before they get fired as long as they're communicating to you and me. Think about that. You know, fucking insane that is, Kate. It's the safest agency in the world, but it's completely predicated on how much people talk to us to fix shit, not to each other to talk shit. Who I like that? That was it right there. I love you, happy holidays. I can't wait to see you in a couple of weeks. VaynerNation, what is good? It is time again for podcast with friends where I bring people from different worlds doing cool shit and we just kind of chop it up. I'm excited about this episode. I'm obsessed with TikTok Live. I think all three of you should build on TikTok Live. Everybody doesn't go live because they think they have to do something. I think you should go live while you're eating lunch. Oh, that's what I do. Tell me. I do live sometimes on TikTok where it's just me eating and talking to people for like two hours. Everybody heard on Twitch? If you're trying to build your shit, because I know you are, please pay attention to that. TikTok Live to me right now is one of the best arbitrages, one of the best ways to day trade attention. We're on mute. Yeah. Set it on mute. Wait, what do you want to keep on? Meetings, hashtag test. Okay. Because when we do it, I want to always go back and be like, this is what we can do. I'd love to do some B-Friends stuff right now. I think this is like a potential evolution of DailyVee. And if I can figure out how to unmute enough that there's value, and if I can figure out what can be playing when we're on mute, maybe it's old podcasts, music, up and coming artists. That could be cool. People discovering new artists while they're watching. We'll figure it out, but I'm excited. I have a lot of passion that we have to stop making videos that people don't want to watch. This phenomenon of making commercials has to finally hit ahead in our industry. Nobody on this Twitch channel right now, nobody in these streams, like they do not want to watch these boring 30 second videos. And you know this, Dina, as a senior marketer, they're freaking expensive. Wasting money in any shape or form in marketing is a bad idea. Running regular television commercials on network and cable at the costs of what they are today is fascinating. This is the truth. I mean, you're seeing it meeting up and meeting up and meeting to recap a little bit the South Victoria and Hannah and Marcus, my chief of staffs. We're just planning, trying to take care of like some things. Hold on one second. I run a Twitch stream on mute now, my whole day in my office. And Snowflake just asked, Gary, do you have a Boston presence, I guess for the company? I just wanted to answer him and tell him that we do not because I hate the Patriots. And now let's go back to this awesome meeting with Telly. Everybody buy a Telly. I really gotta pee in my pants. Yeah, let's bang this out so I can go pee. If this is something you were doing, how would you tackle it? It advice to just get them to see that color is a valuable tool for wellness. An ungodly amount of podcasts and social media content is the most feasible way for someone who doesn't have lots of dollars to get a message across its storytelling. And I think that comes in blog form, streaming form, podcast form, and then social media, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, like it's content, baby. I really do appreciate you. I'm incredibly humbled that any of you would just join and chill out with me for today. Means a lot to me. I have a funny feeling the community in here is gonna get very friendly and awesome. We'll probably be muted given the nature of the meetings I'm having. To recap everybody what's going on here, I'm just testing something new. Like a daily B meets ASMR kind of thing here that I think could end up being really cool. And I hope this shows you how the sausage is being made. Like that's just saying here. And I think it's gonna really matter. Like daily B really showed people. But I think this is like even more real life. And so I have a feeling that this 129 people is eventually gonna be 12,000 people. Like I think I can really build this, but I'm just testing this the first time I'm really doing it. We've been talking about it. So I'm excited. So thank you for being here. So what I'm about to do now is hang out with a bunch of people virtually who own an NFT from B Friends that gives them access to that. And I'm excited about it. Guess in the comments my fastest growing platform right now. So a lot of LinkedIn answers TikTok. The answer to the question and it's not even close. Facebook. Gaining thousands and thousands of followers a week. I can't push all of you enough towards TikTok live. Meanwhile, like it might be Facebook. It might be LinkedIn. It might be Twitter acts. Like all of you are gonna be better at certain platforms than others. Cam Cam just asked, how am I using Facebook? I'm posting on my Facebook page. Written only is crushing. Literally transcribing words out of my mouth, typing them out, hitting post. So you gotta try different shit. Look what a pack leader dog said. I post the same shit on all platforms currently, time issue, I totally get it. And Facebook has grown most by far. You know why? This is how day trading attention works. There's still millions of people on Facebook, but almost every contemporary modern creator is not making content on Facebook. Supply and demand. I don't know if all of you know this, but we've opened a restaurant in VCR group called Little Maven. It just opened. It's in New York City. And like I'm blown away by the feedback. We're one weekend. For everybody who's in New York, or if you're visiting New York for the holidays, please go check out Little Maven. It's pretty exciting. Brother, I'm really glad you came. I wasn't really excited to come here. Price this when you get out of one hour of the dinner. I couldn't agree more. And in different forms, I'm aware that I potentially tonight can bring value to people, but like it's people period. I mean, it happens to me all the time from people that are accomplished, people that are struggling, people that are different. You know, like I'm gonna leave right now. And many of you might get the most value, not from me tonight, but from someone that said something here. It's powerful. People, it's very powerful.
