Day trading attention means that you do not put anything on a pedestal. I have no romance to social, to Google, to Facebook, to TikTok, to myself or anything I've done prior to my career. I care about today, right now, and what is overpriced and underpriced behavior to make the thing that I want to happen happen. All that is happening is supply and demand. When Google AdWords came out, I bought the word wine on Google AdWords the day Google AdWords came out for five cents and owned it for nine and a half months before anybody bid me up. That's how you win. If you are targeting the 13 to 20 year olds, I just want to clarify it for you right now. The only thing they give a crap about right now from storytelling platforms the way I look at them is Instagram, Snapchat and Vine. Jerome Jar, a very famous Vine or Snapchat or Instagrammer, and I started an agency called Grape Story, a sister agency to VaynerMedia, all those characters. Last May, where we represent the best talent in the emerging content platforms to do branded content and things of that nature, I actually think right this second as I take this show, Facebook is the best direct selling marketing platform in the world. We're literally going to do a live QVC. I think retail, selling stuff online is very real to me. I'm a big believer in it. Instagram is clearly going in the right direction. I'm fascinated by Musically right now. It's a social network that's emerging. I think Musically is absolutely, at least already in Yik Yak territory where it's like really got my attention. Snapchat's more fruitful than Facebook right now video for somebody that's up and coming. Even though Facebook video is a big, big, big platform, it's harder to break through that noise. It's supply and demand of attention. Supply and demand of attention. I think influencer marketing is going to have an incredible golden era of a decade. I think we're in the beginning of it and I'm very fond of it. Organic reach of just posting on LinkedIn as if it was Facebook nine years ago is at a level that I haven't seen since Facebook. TikTok is in a place similar to all the platforms before it where the attention is so underpriced on TikTok. As you know, there is no version of you getting 4 million followers on Instagram in a month starting tomorrow. TikTok is so unique right now. The right answer is at this second to massively triple down on TikTok. I want to start a social network that only lets you post once every 24 hours. That's the restriction. YouTube shorts is incredibly interesting. Twitter has announced that they're going to make a much bigger play towards the creative. So I would say six months ago it was pot committed TikTok. I would argue that they're all going through the merit of the creative is the distribution now. So all of them and because the best of the best are so focused on TikTok, there might be even more arbitrage in YouTube shorts and Facebook reels and things of that nature. Facebook reels which are similar to TikToks and Instagram reels have exploded. Facebook dominates 50 to 70. Attention. It is the only asset that everyone in here must chase to produce what they want. The reason to be early is no different than the reason to be early in real estate. We're sitting here in Hudson Yards. We were here four years ago as a tenant. That was a better price per square foot than it is now because this is all built out. That's how I think about the end consumers awareness. Organic reach on Facebook six years ago when I was screaming at the top of my lungs was remarkably low and that really helps small businesses. As larger businesses come in and start spending ad money, the cost of getting into the stream goes up. It's like everything else. Super Bowl used to cost a lot less when a lot less people watched it. Day trading attention isn't about predicting what's next. It's about staying on the pulse of where people's eyes and ears are today and marketing for the now wherever that happens to be. The biggest misstep that I see from everybody is they're obsessed with yesterday. They're curious and willing for tomorrow but they're missing the mark today. In 2042 I'm going to stand right here and be like you fucking idiot still do social media? I mean it. Day trading attention means that you do not put anything on a pedestal. I have no romance to social, to Google, to Facebook, to TikTok, to myself or anything I've done prior to my career. I care about today, right now and what is overpriced and underpriced behavior to make the thing that I want to happen happen. Period.
