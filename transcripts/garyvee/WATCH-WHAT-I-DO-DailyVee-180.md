You have two options, stay patient or quit. Which one's more attractive, George? I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like a lasso. Macro, Macro. Like a vision boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Tabba motherfuckers, I've been telling you. Countless talking about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. That meanin' I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to tackle. Hey guys, I'm gonna do this quick call. But I wanna just state something that's happening on Insta, there's so much growth for me on Instagram. And I'm concerned that people are getting confused. I don't think I'm worth listening to or being paid attention to because I have funny quotes or inspiring quotes or inspiring one minute clips on Instagram. It's not what I'm saying, it's what I'm doing. Check her risers and you'll find another use in the rise. I ask I don't know when I'll find her. Traffic's comin' alive and I'm seein' people change. I run in front of my eyes and reads why I can be contrived by the rule of the line. And why not keep the bitch my heart and why the stick at the side when nothing was to come of it. We saw her crazy inside, shed a glass at the dash, pushed the pedal and drive. And she convinced me to get drunk and now she's making me mad. I'm not gonna let her get mad. I'm not gonna let her get mad. I'm not gonna let her get mad. I haven't seen a sense of what an obstacle is crazy when they watch a new crazy when they watch mm-hm. Oh, way, y'all's the music man Fuck it, join the hospital. As soon as you get away from southwest. People that are like, givin' feedback right now, like, both pro and con, please, please, don't get confused , like, obviously I communicate I'm a human being, but this is about what I'm fucking doing 18 hours a day. Not what I'm posting three times a day on Instagram. It's the execution. Come on YouTube live. Give it to me. I'm live, but I'm not really live. Nothing. It's trying. It says I'm live, but I'm not. Can you guys hear me? Damn. I love this. All right guys, I'm gonna figure out how to get a better connection. I will definitely be back on this. We will definitely do this. Life will happen, I promise. I'm not magic or special or anything and how clever my picture is on Instagram. I'm trying to be special on the fact that I'm out executing strategically and then putting in the actual work to build businesses that come from merit and a good place and bring enormous value to the people within them and the people that watch how it's done so that they can map it and do it themselves. I don't think I should have any guests on Ask GaryVee anymore. People just get upset that I interrupt and I think they're right. I'm just not willing to not be me. Just fine, can't do everything perfectly. You've always done that. Back to one library TV news. I couldn't get upset that. Yeah, I'm not good at it. The funniest part is I don't do anything perfectly. I do a couple of things solid. The jewel one. The jewel one I did really good. I thought I was like, no, no, Tony could too. Like everybody can, Seth Godin can too. Like the jewel one I really tried. I really tried on Tony. Tony had a go. And so like I want to move it along. Like it's how my brain works. Like by the way, it's like there's plenty of people that email me that love it because they don't like listening to podcasts that like you let the person answer for 700 years and everybody knows what the fuck they're saying. Sorry. You're always right. It's what you do. But I don't want to get people just like people are very sad. I don't like this set now. What's that? No, I just, actually, you know what that's it. I'm only doing guests and you know what? I'm gonna triple down. I'm not even gonna try anymore to be somewhat, you think I'm interrupting now? Wait to fucking episode 300 motherfucker. I'm gonna have 15 of the most famous fucking people you ever saw in the rest of the fucking world. So this is about my fucking post. It's about my execution. I don't wanna see you walking on my kitchen floor. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. When you manize a city and you said we want deep out here, but we needed some more. We need to need to create content and distribute it. It's not do for complicated. You know, it just fucking mess it. Airport life is sad that I'm so cozy to remain for? It's what it feels like home. What do we have? We have Naples and we have Atlanta. We have St. Louis. We have Austin. We have New York. We have New York. Today anything super sister I said go, tellin' me to run a mile Are you still in love with me? If you wanna make it real Sorry, I know you probably get this like every single hour But, and it's probably really cool for you But, yeah It's really cool for me I was like just scroll on Instagram and I was like no way What's your name man? Liam Thanks for saying hello brother Yeah absolutely, do you mind if I get a picture of you? No, no problem Thank you very much My pleasure, I really appreciate that Thanks for saying hello Real pleasure Thanks my man Thank you brother I'm super excited to be down here in Florida Pretty epic dinner event tonight Trouty's here But you already know that because I'm sure you'll show that goofy thing he did Should be a pretty epic night A lot of business development Pretty senior stuff should be really cool Friday really looking forward to it This Friday, south by southwest My 10th anniversary of going to that conference The place where a lot of this happened Where I met a lot of the people that changed the course of my professional career Really got into the web 2.0 movement Giving a Q&A keynote So instead of pontificating just rolling in saying Come if you know my spiel Fire away with your questions Really looking forward to it Should be a lot of fun And we'll see what comes of it Really not sure what's gonna happen I'm a counter punch I'm sure it's the same old stuff right People looking for permission to go People looking for that extra push That extra motivation Some people looking for that subtle detail That secret Here's a secret It's four letters W-O-R-K That's the fucking secret That will always be the secret It's the only thing you can control Your talent is your talent You can only maximize it And so it should be fun Really looking forward to it South by always good mix of like Corporate Fortune 500 people, entrepreneurs Startup Hardcore Tech founders Media journalists Real hodgepodge Real kind of cool melting pot Of different people with different agendas Different strategies So looking forward to it You know for all of you That are going to South by Southwest My one tip is to just say hello Right, the conferences are about networking The content you can watch the next day Or follow the Twitter stream right But saying hello And sparking up a relationship Is something that's not really replicable Genuinely maybe the only time You ever get to do it So whether it's somebody you admire Or you're just standing in line And you don't know the person You never know if that person Is the key to your next step I think a lot of people think information Is the unlock to the next chapters Of their career But I find that it's the people That are often the actual unlock And so a really easy tactic Say hello, be warm and kind And network I know some people Have anxiety with that Or this and that I'm empathetic to that But I would highly recommend trying to break it If you're going to a conference like South by The networking is the ROI Good afternoon, Instagram How are you? Hope you're well You okay after that tremendous drop? How do you stay patient when building a brand?
