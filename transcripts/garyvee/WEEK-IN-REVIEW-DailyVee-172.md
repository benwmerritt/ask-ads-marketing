Macro, I'm from mom and castle, gotta look round like gravel, coming back around like lasso. Macro, Macro, like a visual boy, I see with clarity, I hustle like my name is Gary Vee. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts are stolen by equity, I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree, they meanin' I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the word, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to heaven. So let's expand on shooting for the moon, and landing on the clouds, or shooting for the clouds and landing on the roof. Shoot for the fuckin' moon. Because the stars are better than if you shot through the clouds. Because if you shoot through the clouds, you're gonna end up on the roof. Here comes Jordan, Jordan's running, running for our workout. There he is, there we go, there we go. Anyway, hey, hey, hey. So anyway, what I meant in there was the fact of the matter is that people's goals aren't big enough. Like, I think that people make way too many short term goals and they're thinking of one and three year macros. And so for me, one of the great things about trying to buy the New York Jets is it's stretching my thinking. A lot of my behavior is five, seven, twelve, fifteen years old, long. And so I think that when your goal is to, you know, own a BMW, or if your goal is to get a Rolex watch, your behavior becomes more short term. So one of the things I try to teach my managers, my entrepreneurs, my audience is level up your thinking, try to leave a legacy. All of a sudden you become a better person. Try to buy the New York Jets, all of a sudden you become a more successful business person. Stretch your goals. Make me a promise after this episode, stretch your goals. One of the things to expand on in this weekly recap is why did I buy PureWOW? So a lot of PureWOW meetings this week. Obviously VaynerMedia is an agency, right? A paid media agency. We buy ads on websites and other platforms. A creative agency. We make pictures and videos that you see on those platforms. But part of my plan, always along with VaynerMedia, was to create and or buy a media company. Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Conn and S. & Hers, People Magazine. But what does that look like in a new digital age? The age of vice, the age of refiner 29, the age of bar stool. And so looked for about a year, wanted to create a holding company VaynerX, that VaynerMedia stuff would sit over here. And the gallery is what I call the media world. PureWOW being the first acquisition in that world. PureWOW to me was winning in that upper millennial, low gen X female demo. Which makes the buying decisions of most products in our homes today. And was a very attractive place. Plus Mary Kate, the editor, that voice, her team, incredible Ryan Harwood, a friend off the field. Watched him from afar. Never even considered PureWOW because Ryan was a friend off the field. And then stumbled into it about 18 months ago, 15 months ago as a conversation. Got to the right price on both ends and made the move. And now the goal is really to create one of the great female media brands of all time around PureWOW. So I'm excited about it. So just to round out the repertoire, you kind of have an army belt, a Batman belt of different things. And so PureWOW and media companies, and I'll be looking to get more. But PureWOW was really at huge scale, one of the top 5, 7 players in that female demo. But was really built around the creative story. Not traffic arbitrage from Facebook or Instagram. Because that nature plus felt like there was a lot of what I was learning on Instagram. And Facebook that could be applied to PureWOW. So 1 plus 1 equals 3 scenario. And just the progression, the progression of the journey of the master plan. It was the right time to be in our media's at scale. And to build out the media property arm of this journey. Hey Gary, I'm having a question. You are building a personal brand next to your companies. And I would like to know whether everybody should have a personal brand. So businesses come and go. The person stays longer usually. Let's say 80 years. So it might be a very good idea to have a personal brand. Let us know please. Thank you and greetings from Germany. The skills, the stomach and appetite for all the people that want to troll and things of that nature. I think it's a very personal thing. I think it's like raising a family. It's like a relationship. I don't want to fly in here and tell you everybody should. Everybody who's capable and wants to should jump into the pool. If you're debating it because there's a lot of vanity there. I do think in 2017 some of the narcissistic kind of vanities have gone away as all of us are now kind of putting out content and living some version of a personal brand in comparison to 2008 when I wrote Crush in 2009 when it came out. So yes, I'm a fan of it. And I think there's a lot of upside that comes with it. But like anything in life, there's a yin and yang. And so there's definitely some baggage and some personal feelings getting hurt. You've got to have the stomach for that feedback. So I'm a fan. I think people should do it. I think it's good for business. I do think that as your business career evolves, it means that you have a base every time you start something new if you decide to go that route. And so I'm passionate about it. I think it's good. What did I mean by fixing the plane while you're flying it? You said where I'm going? We're fixing the airplane while we fly it. By the way, by the way, by not taking a stop in Providence, Rhode Island to fix something and then Kansas City, Missouri, we've lapped the world 15 times while everybody's still fixing their brakes and fucking Wichita. The big thing there is that too many people, oops, too many people aren't moving. You always have to be constantly moving. It's like right now, just got done with these hard rows. I felt like I had it in my mind even though I'm not breathing super well. I'm just moving. I'm just going to work through it. I'm not going to wait. Too many people think that you have to like stop, fix and go. I think very much like it's NASCAR, right? You come in, pit, move. I've got a lot of problems at VaynerMedia, but I don't stay off the offense on a lot of the great things that are going on. VaynerTalent, Vayner, the small business thing, by the way, small businesses hit me up. You know, the consulting stuff, the video production stuff, the paid media stuff, sure there's a lot of things to fix, but too many people dwell on what's wrong with their organization. And they spend all their mind time, their strategy on trying to fix that. That's like parking the plane and fixing. I'm like, look, I've got to fix those things because if you don't fix it, the company breaks. But I'm going to stay on the offense. I'm going to keep flying my plane and fixing it midstream. And so that's what I mean by that. You don't have to dwell, stop and address all your issues. And then when it's perfect, you move forward. It's a huge mistake that slows you down. That's why so many people build smaller businesses. One of the reasons I've built very big businesses is that of course I've got to fix them because if you don't fix them, you die. But I'm always tripling down on my offense as well.
