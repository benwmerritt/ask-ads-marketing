Police is coming by the way. Step on it. There was an accident. Fuck this accident. Fuck this. Oh that was a cop itself. I would have followed that black car back in the day. Good thing I'm not drive anymore. Macro. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro. Like a vision boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts were stolen by equity. I'm triple H giving the pedigree. That mean that I'm special, my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty in the earth. I'm moving furniture to heaven. Cities like New York, Hartford and Providence are all expected to get between 12 to 18 inches of snow. Boston and Philadelphia could see up to a foot and some other areas could get more than two feet. Any case? Morning Rick. Morning. Nobody's going anywhere anymore. Got a flight out of New York. Yes, smart. Fast. You don't get the benefits unless you move. Got a blizzard coming in. I'm going to switch up some flights. Jordan's flights got canceled. D-Rocks. Who knows where it ends considering that. Working through some kind of higher level structural stuff so that it's big, that helps. A lot of times we get stuck in the day to day calendar and there's a lot of meetings that don't allow us to quickly make macro like two hours with the leadership team happen. Because in order to do that, that's canceling. If you've got eight, 15 minute meetings or something like that. Kind of letting those people down. So, when someone like this comes in, blizzard, he's flying to SF with our CFO, was decided within 10 minutes, booked the flights. We actually got the last two first and last flights out of New York City tonight. Booked the hotel. He's going to spend five hours tomorrow with the CFO all on a whim. He was supposed to be in Austin. So, within four days he was in Austin. Then he was in New York, built out of full bay in New York, which was fantastic. But then that all got canceled. Now it's even more fantastic. In between those times, this came about. How he's flying to SF with our CFO. Spending a whole day together. Catch up on some sleep. And then from there, he speaks in SF Wednesday. Speaks in SF Thursday. Flies back. Full day in New York Friday. Goes to Vancouver Saturday. Speaks in Vancouver. Flies home. Then he's doing a week with family. So, a lot of logistical stuff. Just getting better at it, which helps. It's also anxiety when you first start booking a lot of flights. Like, typically when someone is going out, you can think about booking a flight. Going on a vacation with your family. It's this big process of like, okay, we're going to book the flights. Now I book flights in my sleep. And so that anxiety of like hitting by, like has gone away and that was like real. So I can just quickly boom, boom, boom. Yeah. What's that? I think it just, you know, you're a young dude. How old are you? 20. Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to ebb and flow. You know, I think if this place is going to be the continuing rocket ship that it is, there may be some real opportunities for you. And or I think that you get to a place where you're like, fuck man, I just need to do shit for myself. Here's the good news. This office is open for you if you want to grow here or if you want support or strategy to win outside of here. I think there is no advice. It's hard to bounce both. You've got to reverse engineer your mindset of like where you're at and your world's going to change. So many things happen between 28 and 35 in a man and woman's life. I think you need to just think about how you want it to play out. There's no wrong or right. You've got plenty of time. Things will change. I mean, do you want to have family? Where do you want to live? These are things that really start to manifest. I think the one, I will give you one big piece of advice. I do think the economy can't stay great forever. And I do think that that's something you have to factor in if you're going to go with more high risk and do it all by yourself or reverse. I mean, I don't know. Vayner's going to do better than others, but like, I think, I mean, the amount of agency people are going to be looking for jobs in two or three years when shit hits the fan, you know? So, I don't know. The good news is you can come and have any conversation with me. Good. Anything I can answer for you? Let's see. I'm sure like you get asked all types of interesting questions and people are probably coming in and play. You know, I just want to answer the questions people have. You know, like I'm not looking for something clever. I'm looking for truths, you know? Me and my friends are kind of like, we've been talking about this a lot and we are like in our mid-20s starting to evaluate our passions and the validity of our paths. And it's this question like, what is it that makes you forget to shit? Being a businessman. Like, I've got it. I've always had it. Like, running my businesses. Like, I don't even eat. Can't shit if you didn't eat. Do you know what I mean? So, I got it real good. So, I, that's what stops me from going to the bathroom, the game. Like, I mean, like, you know, it's crazy. I do the blog, but it's edited. So, people are like, whoa, you never eat or anything and then people leave comments like, but it's the way it's edited. But like, Tyler and D-Rock know, like, I don't, and like, I don't do anything. Like, I'm a robot because I'm so passionate. Like, my work, my work. You know, that's what I wish for everybody. Ready? Yeah, I gotta just go. Sorry. 3, 2, 1, go. Actually, this is a pretty impressive resume. But do you have any degrees? Yeah, actually I have two of them. Two degrees, huh? You're hired. My number, right? Real pleasure. Real pleasure. Alright, let's walk. Okay. Want me to do a YouTube live for this episode? With Wi-Fi? Yeah, right now. Okay. Yeah, should, right? Because we got Wi-Fi, I'll go for it hard. Yeah. There you go, Sean. You can flip it around. Hey, everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and this was episode 244 of the Ask GaryVee Show. Hey, Taylor, it's GaryVee. You're on the Ask GaryVee Show. No way! Yes, way! Okay, how do you get over the stump of the stump of you're graduating and you feel all this pressure because you're trying to build something but you're still so young but you want to do this fast and grow it big and I'm just in a rut. You need to be patient as fuck, Taylor. You're 22, 23 years old. Like, what do you think's going to happen overnight? Yeah, I know. So you need to be fast, 7 a.m. to 2 in the morning every day but in the big picture you need to realize nothing good is going to happen for the next six years. Every second you spend thinking about what somebody else has is taking away from time that you could create something for yourself. Yeah. You're losing. You're losing because you're laying in your bed looking at somebody's fucking glamorous, photoshopped picture of them doing something cool and you're envious and you're jealous and you're impatient and it's crippling your upside. Yeah, because that's where I want to be and I know I'm not there yet. You haven't done shit. I know. So go do shit that actually gets you there so that you earn it instead of like you dwelling that you're not there and hoping something's going to happen. I don't know what's going through your mind. Yeah, well I guess I'm hustling on the side but I don't think I'm doing enough, I guess. You've got to deploy patience and you've got to love the process. I'm addicted to the process of the battle scars, the setbacks. You need to stop giving a shit about what anybody else has and realize that if you put your head down and just work for the next 10 years, no glamour, no new fucking car, suitcase, jewelry, trip, event, no Coachella, no fucking new fucking sneakers, like fucking work, you will have it. And every time you care about one of the things I just mentioned it will slow down your process of having them. Work. That's the answer to all these questions. Learn things, do stuff, try to sell shit, learn how to make money. Work. Alright, I will. I'm going to give you the best piece of advice I got. Alright, I have a pen. Knock yourself out, it's not super complicated but I think it's actually right. You need to, more than anything, think about two core things in my opinion. And this is off the very little context, we need to get to know each other better. One, you have to, at all costs, not beat your own self up with yourself. Yeah. At all costs. Fair enough. It's huge. It's huge and it's hard to do. Correct. It's huge. You need to really be your own biggest fan instead of critiquing everything. Yes, in a minute. Let's do that, Christiana, you're drawing with you too. You should go downstairs in 10 minutes. I need to see Roger. Okay. I need to bang him all out. I want to. With the risk of you missing this flight? What time's the flight? It's at 7.55 but it could take you an hour and a half to get over there. And it's just going to be mad and it's going to be clear through. This is fucking insane. This dude is so talented, right? We need to hang this. Yeah. Best painting ever. My man, Franco, appreciate it. Look at the blue eyes. Look at Joe Namath's blue eyes. Yeah, yeah. It's huge. Or comparing yourself to other people. Yes, because you don't know their truth, by the way. You don't know what's under the hood. Yeah. It looks the part. People can tell you at the fucking Zaki's wine tasting on Saturday in Scarzone what's actually happening but it's not true. Do you understand? Absolutely. It's important. But it's also like... Number two. This one. Of course. Number two. Moments in time. Mm-hmm. You've got to wrap your head around how young you actually are which seems insanely different when you have kids and the, the, the. You have to wrap your head around how early in the process this is and how this is just a very small moment in time. How we build the social following and how we see it and people from my team and I think both would be smart depending on how this flesh is out after whether you know you're not doing anything with a business partner in short term or whether you are and then how does that incorporate into that. Very quickly I can tell you you need to get every voice out of your head beside yourself and you need to love yourself. You will win. No, you will. If you just accept yourself for who you are like fuck man do you have any shortcomings I have? But it doesn't feel like that if you're consuming my content because I just don't have any time for it. Like what? You're going to beat yourself up? Can't live your life based on other people's point of view. What's it saying on timing? No. Holy shit we're going to miss this flight and if we do we're finished. Oh fuck. 714? That's really bad man. That's really fucking bad. What is it 755? Fuck man. We're in deep shit. Police is coming by the way. There was an accident. Fuck this accident. Fuck this. Oh that was a cop itself. I would have followed that black car back in the day. Good thing I'm not driving anymore. Avi what's the number now? 715 still. We're getting rerouted so we're going to get off here and take a look at the streets. There must have been a huge accident huh? What's it say now? Bye. Thank you man. Bye bye. Pumps about that. Pissed I'm going to miss this flight and I'm going to lose out on like $150,000 in speaking. It closes at 745. 726. Yeah it's over. 726. What time does it fight? 735. You need to eliminate all costs, everybody else's voices and everything starts clicking. You need to remember this conversation because it's easy and feels good right now but then three weeks from now it goes away. This is real shit. This is how you get happy.
