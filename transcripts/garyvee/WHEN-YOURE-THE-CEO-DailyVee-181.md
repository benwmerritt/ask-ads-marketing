I guess we signing off. I'm not really sure how to end this shit. Guess I'll just talk my shit. Yeah, young and impatient. I don't have time for changes. I need consistency. I hear too much complaining. Don't do this shit for fun. I take the serious excuses. All I keep hearing just step the bitch in and get it done. Niggas going through motions. I tell her miss me. I'm focused on making history. Warmth is for my intensity drawn. You cannot limit me. Moments like these are hard to find. I just want what's mine. The crown and the title. Don't let me near you. You over-wrapping. You rap like a hundred words. For minutes, still no one hear you. Hard to hear you over the laughter. My confidence tatted. I'm ready. I wanted it better. Don't none of you scare me. What happened? Too obsessed with maintaining the fact that you made it? All of that money talk. You over-copping Satan. You rap for your friends. I rap for the world. I'm out chasing dreams. You out chasing girls. Too busy FaceTime and borrowing bars. I did more than you in a year. I know that's gotta be hard. A million views and nifty seats. You boys can't compete. You know I started my business because of you. Thank you. Yes, I saw that. It was awesome. We were gonna talk a couple years. Got a partner. We're now launching Metam through. Did a vlog. I was one page in the AskaryBee. I was like, I gotta do something. Started the vlog. I made a faster for the city. I made a whole bunch of business connections. Sting it in the social. Huge. Makes me happy now. You're welcome. I'll grab something. Yeah. That's good. Awesome man. Yeah. Continued success. You rock. Hi. Jill. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Awesome. Perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. I don't know if you put your connection in. Yeah, that's my grass. I made the connection. I got the connection. Yeah. How are things? Good. Yeah. Oh well. Good. One of the things we're finding, I know the vendors out here will agree and it's all the dealers, is there's this change of narrative on metrics. What's working, what's not working. Which metrics to look at. Which ones are not. Sales of fucking cars. And the way we do that, and the way we do that is by suffocating the marketing. I want to be in a bake off with your stuff. My picture can say ask for Rick or call. Do you guys know how to get Google phone numbers? Get a bunch of Google phone numbers. Use Twilio. Make all your separate marketing call a different phone number and then measure it. Not only that because calls aren't sales of cars. Then follow through in which you might get 80 calls from Facebook. You might get 130 phone calls from the radio. But if you sell one car from the radio and seven from Facebook because the data you targeted where people actually in the goddamn market to buy a car. The reason you guys spend so much money is you're always spending because you never know when the person's in consideration. Facebook has data of people searching to buy cars and you can get in their feed. I mean what's the matter with people? I'll tell you what's a matter. You don't know that truth that I know. You didn't know that. You didn't know that. You didn't know that Facebook, you think this stuff that came out the other day about the FBI and the CIA like hacking every that. Yes. Like just assume everybody's looking at you at all times. Privacy is dead. You are naked. You don't like it. Stop using your phone. Let's see how long you last. So yes. It's a huge advantage. And so you know the metric is selling cars man. Like you know the reason I want to pay an Instagram influencer who's like good looking ab dude or a booty chick is because I know 4,000 people show up to my dealership and three of them may buy a car and I'm willing to make that bet. I have to at least taste it. I want to see what it looks like. How are you not curious? You touched on the third. Let me tell you how you do it. You go into Instagram. You search. You search a hashtag like whatever you just search. Actually search. I'm sorry. You go into Instagram. There's a search bar up top. You search by location. So you put in your zip code, your town. It shows you the 12 most trending pictures within a one mile radius of your goddamn town. You then look at all the pictures. I promise you seven of them are attractive, scantily clad. The other five or something else. But you click on them. You see how many followers they have. They're global. It's not like all their followers are from Alpharetta. You know like they're all over the place. But you click on them and then you there's a triple little button in the top right corner. That's how you message people. You click it. You DM the person. You say I own a car dealership. I'd like to pay you to show up at my car dealership this Saturday from 12 to 4 and you tell your Instagram followers. They'll reply. They'll say how much. You say I have no idea. Some weird guy told me to do this. How much is it? They give you an answer and then you take a risk. You may lose $600. You may crap your pants when they ask you for $50,000 and you realize how real this is and you keep playing and then you try and then you learn. When you're a pioneer, you have to taste it. There's no report. There's no white paper. There's no modeling mixed metrics that are going to teach you how that's going to work. When you're the first explorer, you have to taste the berries and hopefully they're not poisonous. Good stuff. Questions? Do we have some questions from out here? I want to make sure we get to the top. My name is Nelly and I came from Soviet Union too. I love it. Hey everybody, one life. Don't worry about your accent. Just do you. Your truth is your truth. They'll love you as long as it's your truth. Two. I want a flip challenge leaderboard because I've already tripped. You're really at that number? I know that guy. I know that guy. That's awesome. You made this? Dude, you got some real talent. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Yeah. VaynerMedia is fearless because I'm fearless and I'm in charge. So it's one in the same. It's always fear. It's the fear of the unknown. It's short-term thinking versus long-term thinking. It's acting like the world's ending tomorrow when for the far majority of us will be here 30, 40, 50, 60 years from now. What CEOs and business owners have done a good job with, especially in big companies, is somehow manipulate the conversation that it's not their fault. Like whose fault is it? It's his fault. It's his fault. It's my fault. Like if you're in charge of your shit, it's your fault. So no, I don't see a difference between people and organizations because the organization is following the lead of the singular decision made. Bye. Good luck, man. You're an artist. I know. I'm just a graphic designer. Yes. Put your art out to the world at scale. At scale. I mean every goddamn day on every platform always. You're always one Instagram post, one Facebook post, one Snapchat post, one blog post away from somebody thinking it's great. All right. So does that make sense? Yes, it does. I know a lot of people are buying followers. Bottle it. That means that's a stupidist. Buying followers is the single stupidest thing to do because I'll tell you why. It gets you nothing other than perception. Meanwhile, everybody's smart. Like nobody who's ever bought a follower has ever tricked me that they bought followers. So what happens when you buy followers is the top 10% of smartest people who can bring you the most value in the world think that you're a scam artist. So maybe you tricked the bottom 10%. So when you buy followers, you're up. Yep. Elevator. Take care, guys. Thank you so much. So you're welcome, bro. You got time for one more handshake? Hell yeah. Thank you, man. Appreciate your time. Okay, man. Still well. Thank you, guys. Take care. So, I'm here. Buying followers is insanity. You know? Like, don't... You're worried about other people. Yes. I'm definitely worried. I'm worried they're gonna judge me. I'm embarrassed about how my follower count right now. Don't. We all started there. You're wrapping your self-esteem into following count is a huge mistake. Don't buy followers. Don't cut corners. You got to be patient. You're such a baby. You're so much... You're fucking crazy. Don't worry about that. Like, you got to care about... Stay inside yourself. I respect you so much more for having 97 followers that are yours than somebody who bought a bunch. And I can tell because their engagement rate is shit compared to how many followers they have. Do you understand? Yeah, I do. Those guys, they don't talk to their followers or anything. Patience. Patience and inside yourself. Nobody else. Inside yourself, patience. Inside yourself, patience. That's it. Thanks, Gary. It was really nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Bye, Bianca. Bye, Bianca. Thank you, guys. Take care. Have safe travels. A honey empire runs all the way through, right? Like, I'm at this point. As you guys know, 60-second club, a lot of t-shirts, a lot of books, but also a lot of two- and five-minute FaceTime. So, I'm about three in right now. I'm about to do a job. Here we go. A job. Bopara Jandala. Listen, Vaynerchuk gets put here, too. You're an engineer. That's right. Makes sense. You're practical and entrepreneurship. I would tell you to level up your thinking. I wouldn't think about it as weddings and as birthday. I would think of your main thing as just calligraphy. So, I just went on a huge email storm, I guess. Email rant to the whole company. I said, how many did you get to your office? Well, I sent like 54 emails to the whole company. It was great. Just huge communication thing about speed and efficiency. Some of you might have saw my tweet. That started it. Then it got going. I just got a lot done in an hour and a half on email that will impact our company for a long time. It's nice, huh? By the way, for everybody at home, this whole to-do about the amazing weather, it's 59 in New York. I feel like people will be dead in that life. There's like the books. This is when I'm always my cheapest, my desperateest. You've always been very smart to trade on me during those times. I've actually always admired that and thought that was smart. Give it some thought. I'm always jammed with you. Number two, and this was interesting. Do you guys have an agency or do you do all your creative marketing and media work internally? Love it, brother. Talk to you later. Four minutes to monster things. Four minutes. Fuckin' put both times there. Start done. Put some music because it's freaking super. Try to sneak a word or two in.

This is the kind of meeting I like. Two people. Yep. It's a very good number. It's going to get cool. What is it? Empty conference rooms. All of a sudden we have empty conference rooms. Crazy. Crazy how that works out. Is that it? Duh. Yes. This is a nice looking meeting to human beings. Feeling great? Feeling good? Feeling good. I feel it. Feeling great. I love it. Yeah. I just wanted you to come in. I wanted you to come into the Boston office. Yeah. I didn't know about this. Steve, can you get this in the background? Yeah. You can get it in the background. Yeah. Sure. Can you get a thumbs up? Can we get a thumbs up? No. You can't get thumbs up. Some things actually don't really bother me. To be very honest. Really don't. Brandon Marshall is a giant. It's more of a tropex. Yeah. Oh my god. This is insane. Aw. Uh-huh. This is really cool. This is my life story. We're probably going to have to frame it. Yeah. Let's frame it. Who made it? Let me get a social for you. Okay. Hold it up real quick. It's a quilt, right? Yeah. This thing is insane. I'm about to give a shout out to the wonderful person that made it. Sick. It's a quilt, right? Preview to BizDev Sunday. It's going to be the main theme. VaynerMedia doing an alumni program. One of the great things about this company is we have so many incredible people who after three, four, five years, or sometimes even after six months, or after working in agency for 15 years, and we're six months here, they know this is the pinnacle, and they're like, oh, it wasn't my agency. It's just an agency life. A lot of small businesses, a lot of large businesses. We're creating an incredible thing. Part of the Honey Empire, an internal alumni program where people can raise their hand, all these startups I'm involved with, all of you, people looking for talent our way. This whole digital 2017 camp thing that we've been talking about, the tours of $10,000 ahead. This is another layer, another big idea, alumni program. If you're a company that's looking to hire unbelievable talent, all disciplines, we're gonna, it's gonna be cool. When somebody comes to us, or when we decide somebody's not part of the team anymore, we're gonna put them in this alumni funnel, and they're gonna shoot out. It's gonna be really cool. I'm pretty excited about changing the way HR and job hunting and the whole thing works. So a little quick little preview in today's DailyVee for what you'll definitely see Sunday. This is the place on the left here. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cut it, Vee. Carrie Vee. How are you? Such a pleasure. How are you, buddy? Feel like I know you. Hi. I'm Tyler. The famous Tyler. Yes, Tyler's here. There's not the Tyler you've been talking to. That's Tyler Schmidt. It's just so many Tyler's. We have multiple Tyler's. So this Tyler is not a... He's just filming a little B-roll, and that's it for my vlog. Is that okay? But if that's not okay, that's fine. The video's not permitted. Awesome, then he's not... Then he's not doing it. No, I mean, we can always arrange stuff like that. Dude, no, it's so... All right, we're out. Super not. During daytime to the light, it's always much better, but yeah, we need to do this a little bit. Time with him and I'll catch up with you. Man, it'd be so crazy if we could actually put everything out there. Like, the real... The real stuff. I want you to keep that part in this episode. The real stuff. Yep, I'm giving it to you 97% real. What Babban's talking about is the insanely difficult shit I'm dealing with. I can't share because it's just involving people's lives and it's inappropriate for me to do so. Now, that being said, it's important for me to continue to reference and I do for you guys so that you guys know that, but there's just nothing but adversity and difficulty. It's... I often say I'm a firefighter. When you're the CEO, it's all your fault. Everything's on you. And... Yeah. I think what's interesting, the reason I'm going to use this clip is your perspective's interesting because it's fresh eyes. You're like, oh, this is what it is. It's real shit. This grass is always greener. Yeah.
