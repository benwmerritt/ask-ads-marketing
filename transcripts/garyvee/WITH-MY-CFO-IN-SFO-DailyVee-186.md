This will be a different look like I'm gonna sit here now and we've been sitting here for an hour, hour and a half and we're gonna sit here for the next five to seven hours re-looking at the financial impacts of our business. You know, we're running between VaynerX with PureWow and VaynerMedia. We're talking about over $150 million dollar entity and so there's a lot of work. There's a shitload of Excel sheets here that I'm not necessarily interested in but the work has to be done and when you get to this scale and you get to 800 people, you know, there's a lot of inefficiencies especially when you're building culture and so I'm just looking at the financial impacts of the business. So this is about as boring as it's not selfies, this is not fun quotes in the interview, this is not the stage people rushing it, this is not DRock waving his fucking hand in the camera, this is fucking real work. The true life behind being a CEO, the big company, GaryVee, DailyVee, these are my side hustles. This is what I do for a living so I'm gonna board the fuck out of you in today's episode. I'm from mom and Casio, got it on the ground like gravel, coming back around like lasso. Maco, like a vision boy, I see with clarity, I hustle like my name is GaryVee. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts are talking about equity, I'm trippin', they're giving a pedigree, they're me and I'm special, my specialty, I'm putting the work till I'm dirty and the earth I'm movin', furniture to heaven. Two Minimutations. Two Minimutations. That's what it is, two Minimutations have killed us. Everybody needs more people because everybody's in everybody's way. My life is different than the picture I painted The pain and deferred the pain Or maybe that's how I drank it Or maybe that's how I contained it Till I spill it to you Let me keep opening I said I saved your life, you saved my tools When depression was resting On my conscience like Danny I never second guessed my sanity I knew I was crazy But that crazy was good Because that crazy was tough They tried to force the pharmaceuticals To reform and harm me But I just did me And do it in a heart I still have to try to get out of this I can say because they didn't have the They had zero patience The two interactions I had with him I was like, brother Like you've got to pay your dues You know, like that's what we all do You know, and the lack of patience I think of Hey guys, it's Gary Everybody on?

Hey, sorry, boss Thank you so much, man Thanks for saying hello I wish you well Bye-bye So, we now have a full name For the Vayner Internal Day Daily Digit... I gotta kind of get back to... Daily Digit Where it says the Daily Digital Deep Dot Is the name of the company It's the name of the company It's the name of the company It's the name of the company It's the name of the company The Digital Deep Dive I want that all to be the same font And the same way And then the... All the D's in the name To be green Got it? So, either... Either... No worries, no worries Either pick the first font or the second font You know what's amazing is the reaction to the culture first? You can do... We're literally doing things big Yeah, I mean, that's the beauty There's no reinforcers You're trying to take me with you Of course, of course You don't need to You know? That's interesting I want you to sit at that point You're building a core here So guys, I'm sitting here I'm talking to Alan Let's show Alan And Alan... Alan has been a remarkably successful You know, corporate CFO And, you know, I think his last P&L That he ran was a $500 million Holding company Like, big, you know... It's not his first fucking rodeo We're doing a lot of stuff here And, you know, I told him Like, you know, we're just talking I just said... D-Rock just said, I want more insight on it Here's very simple When you build culture, this is why honey first Honey empire Instead of empire of honey When you have a honey empire And your direct reports are blindly bought in Because you've done everything right To prove them to trust you You can do big structural changes Big strategy changes Big reorg Big fundament If I emailed the company... If I emailed my direct reports My leaders tomorrow and said We're now selling actual honey Like, we are no longer an agency We now produce honey I just bought a honey farm And, you know, Pasa Robles And we now sell honey And I just think 80% of them will be like Okay, like, what am I doing? Like, yes! Yes, comma So when you build culture And you build trust You can go fast You can do things fast We're about to do Six months worth of work politically In six hours And that's special And that's the difference And that's how you win And that's where big companies die And when you start getting into, you know Nine figures 100 million plus You get bigger And you get slow And when you're the CEO You, uh... You've got to have that buy-in from your constituents To be able to get the shit that you want done And, uh... And on the flip side A lot of corporate CEOs Uh, spend too much time Worrying about the politics under constituents Which then creates non-action Which then creates failure For me, I know I'm going to get 9.3 Out of 10 constituents on board With what I'm about to do And the .7 Won't be here Because there's no options Have to win And speed's part of the equation It's deep Yeah, it's...
