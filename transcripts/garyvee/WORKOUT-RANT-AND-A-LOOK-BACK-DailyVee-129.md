From the same guy Full zip, my fucking ass out of the savage Holy shit! I'm fucking wearing this shit all the time Mmm, yeah What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? Hold. Good. Saturday, not a whole lot of uh, Daily V action. Weekends are always gonna be a little tricky. Jordan and I pumping out a quick like 15-20 minute workout. Happy birthday, Max. Went to the birthday party, went to Jers. That was fun. Just by being scared by myself. Right, check by the next time. That's final call my sister. Change plans, let's do this. You might have class though. You can do it, chief. You know what? So we're doing it. Just been reading all the comments, engaging. Very hip hop kind of week. I'll be doing this, man. I've been looking forward to it. Like if I could do what you did, I'd be the fuck, I'd be real fucking famous because I really understand distribution. Hold, my whole thing, done. My dad's gonna be real happy. If Drake put out 365 days of songs for the rest of his life, he would win. Real punch in my man. How are you? Smell good, man. I appreciate it. Which was fun. Just grinding. Just a lot going on. Such an interesting thing when I was filming Planet of the Apps. A couple weeks ago or in December, Will I Am was trying to razz me and get this kid to go on his team because Planet of the Apps is a little bit more like The Voice. It's the Shark Tank meets The Voice for apps. So we're trying to get people to go on our team so we can mentor them to get in front of the VC. And so he's trying to get this one app to, god my arms are tired. Hold this, just hold like this. So he's trying to get this one app kid to go with him and he goes, look. And we were talking about marketing and getting people to download the app. He goes, look. If you want to go with marketing, if the marketing is what's gonna kill it for your app, then you gotta go with Gary Vee. He's the best marketer I've ever seen, best marketer in the world. But if you care about culture, then you've got, I was so fucking pissed. I was like, motherfucking Will I Am. It was a great move. I jumped in. I'm like, look, if you like culture and marketing so much, Will, why are your headphone companies working with my company VaynerMedia? So we were rousing. But what's been interesting over the last two to four weeks, looking at meme culture, looking at Instagram influencers, looking at Facebook video, looking at a hip hop emerging talent, you know, Flippa and Swag Hollywood and Saab and some of the kids I'm hanging out with, just really looking at the business landscape, why commercials aren't working. There's this incredible moment right now. I feel like I'm penetrating this like culture force field and I can see it, all the pieces coming together and the way that Will calls it culture, I call it attention, day trading attention, attention arbitrage, these subcultures, Jordan fitness influencers, hip hop influencers, cartoon influencers, gamers on Twitch, you know, the entrepreneur hackers, you know, there's just this interesting convoluted matrix that is moving every day musically, Snapchat, Instagram, you know, Facebook doing much more 20 to 30 than people think, you know, stuff like that. Really fascinating. I feel like I'm in it. I feel like I'm really in it. I'm in it right now. Spring, summer, the show comes out. Just feel like 2017 is going to be a beast. What up, everybody? Real quick, we're going to start using clips from a year ago. Things that we filmed in DailyVee that happened a year ago as contact points or make fun of my predictions that were wrong or just DailyVee classics that add a little spice, especially the weekend episodes. So hope you check it. Every episode of DailyVee. You guys are just hacking DailyVee. Yeah, that's it. You gotta put my handle in this time. Dan Grossman. Although I think, yeah, your father's. Anyway, I should have some record. What do you mean? My father's are amazing. This is all about the way you do things. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I shouldn't have some record. What do you mean? My father's are amazing. This is entrepreneurship. You can't fake the musicians. You can fake the attitude. In entrepreneurship, everybody in America, everybody watching this right now, it's the American thing to believe people don't think of entrepreneurship as a skill. They don't think they can be LeBron or be nine inch nails or be 50 cent. But everybody looks at me and says, I can do that. They don't understand that it's a talent. The other thing that's more practical to actually recognize them a talent and let's say they think I'm 100. I'm the best. Yeah. Them being a 68 is actually quite financially and happiness worthy. Whereas if you look at LeBron and he's 100, being a 68 means that you'll spend a lot of time in rec leagues. There's a different thing, right? It costs you money to try to be a 68 musician. You paid 15,000 demo. You have the overhead. You can't pay rent. This thing being a 60, even for the people that are clearly understanding that they're not me talent wise, it's actually quite practical to be a 68.
