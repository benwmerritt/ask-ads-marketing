## Transcript
You know, like, I don't know if any of you ended up like, ever hooking up or marrying your best friend, but not that I'm not. Oh no, no, no, no, we've actually hooked up. We're just not best friends. Um. That's how the episode's gonna start. Macro, I'm from mom and castle. Got it like ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro, Macro, like a visual boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Taba, motherfuckers, I've been telling you. Countdowns was talking about equity. I'm triple H, giving a pedigree. And me and I'm special, my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty and the earth I'm moving from eternity. That's a great question. First of all, and I think you'll love this, within my organization, and I assume here, but like it's a younger company, we haven't had this talk, winning first of all is very individual. Like the most interesting thing for me is actually understanding what everybody in this room thinks winning is for themselves so that we can reverse engineer it. That's what I spend all my time on. I don't give a shit if you wanna buy the jets or if you wanna make $137,000 a year, have ridiculously good work-life balance, still keep a job when you start your family. I don't, it's unbelievable how much I care and how much I don't care about what winning means to you. Meaning I massively care and then you get to define it. For me, it's just about the journey of building businesses. It is my drug, it is my oxygen, I love it. I love that, I love this journey because I wanna see how we stack up with me involved against the other people that are trying to capture the attention. And so in essence, what it is, is one big game of how do I provide the most value so that in return I get the attention that I see. I'd like to get together just, I feel like there needs to be dramatically more communication from the top with this small group. And so I think for all of you individually, it's a good thought to think about when it's on your schedule over the weekend of maybe the one or two things you wanna bring up of closing ties. I'm never gonna be strong at having the core agenda. Maybe the office CO can take that over for me over time. But I think for me, it's just good to get us aligned. A lot of, when I look back at the last six months, a lot of times things are happening in pockets of two or four, six or eight. I think this will give us an opportunity to do that. And then an opportunity to talk about things that are important. So that's what I'd like to do more often. I mean, to me, that's the big thing. Whether it's, or, I wanna make sure we're over delivering on the quality for it and start really having conversations of what can studio do? What, how do we replicate? Lighter, the entire market is recognizing it. Let's understand what's actually happening here. Like at the macro. All of a sudden, after we do these two things, like people believe. Like only actions make you believe. Like right, like the reason I've been pretty passive is like I'm not willing to look at rhetoric. I wanna look at actions. And then when actions happen, you have to make your decisions, right? Like we are really, really, really dangerous. And very excitingly close. Kieran, what's up man? Good to see ya. I think the biggest thing of new labor is figuring out how we get in global. Because global's creating all of the content right now and we're adapting it. Yeah, well we'll figure out that. I mean that will play itself out. So I think that's it. There's actually a lot of women who want to. We're gonna throw a lot of into your guys pod. I wanna really stretch you and Lisa because I just wanna bet on both of you and I wanna kind of help you. I wanna speed your process through the next levels. So this is, like if it goes away, you may get six new things. That's what it's about. You'll see that. You'll just continue to see things. Totally. Got it? Just keep that on the macro. Yes, and you told me three years ago to eat shit and that meant three years and I got it. Eat shit? Italian words. Caviar. But look, look how well my eat shit strategies work for your fucking career. Totally agree, yeah. I'm Kaelin. I am a VP Group Account Director on a few of our large CPG brands here at Vayner. I've been here for almost five years. I think the biggest piece of advice I got from Gary was a few months being at Vayner. I was kind of used to PR where you were constantly on a lot of different brands and a lot of different campaigns. At the time I was really only on one brand for six months straight and I kinda got to him expressing the desire to be on multiple things and he basically told me to eat shit for three years. And I think that there's value in doing one thing consistently on getting better at that one thing over time. And I think he's right. And so we were just kind of joking about how it's been three years. Hey Ethan, it's Gary Vaynerchuk, how are ya? DRock wants some updates on DailyVee now, so here it is. I'm working DRock, that's your update. I did a meeting with my leadership team, I did a meeting with Rezzy, the restaurant app that all of you should be using. I did a meeting with a couple individuals that run key accounts, stopped in hello and said hello to a candidate. That's what I did for the last couple hours. So when I think about DailyVee, I always wonder like, you know it's funny DRock, remember when we started this like the fourth or sixth or ninth day episode, you were like, and this is one we were gonna do two or three times a week, you're like, how are we gonna come up with different stuff? And so like it's clearly worked out, but I'd be remiss to not tell you these are my favorite days. Just a good old fashioned, I'm in New York, the CEO of this company. I talk to you guys a lot about like Gary Vee being my side hustle, we are debating very aggressively on a daily basis, how do we show you more things? We're trying to do that, but even today like already hard, just had a major client meeting, was very inappropriate meeting a new very senior client and I'm empathetic that me rolling in, not only with like camera guy, but we're doing some still shots today as well. Like that's the douchey of shit of all time. Like, you know, that could go over very poorly and so we need to be empathetic for it. I love when we're like seeing athletes or rappers or we're gonna be in some cool settings, I'm sure. I still think you should come to Super Bowl. So when can you leave now? I know I told you no, but you can come Friday. I can come Friday and Saturday if you want me to. Well that's the only time we're gonna be there, you'll just leave Saturday afternoon? Yeah, done, lock it in, it doesn't fuck you up? I mean, it'll be fine, I'll see my mom down on Sunday. You can leave early for Saturday and I'll do the rest. Cool, see this is how we roll. Anyway, where did that go? Oh, it'll be cool things like Super Bowl and like famous people and there'll be a lot more as Planet of the Apps comes out and I actually become more mainstream, recognize them more, things will happen. We have an amazing dinner with like a very all time classic rapper, so everybody's super mad that I'm only focusing on the new stuff, old stuff's coming, but nothing trumps, nothing gets me going more than a solid Monday with a shitload of business meetings where I'm executing and delivering on being the CEO of a nine figure business. This isn't fucking kindergarten anymore. So, just thought I'd tell you that I like executing, I like doing the work, I like eating my own dog food. When I tell you guys to do something, it's only after I did it already. That's the problem that pisses me off so much. Some kid literally emailed me and said, Gary, I need your help, I wanna learn more about social media, did you see this? This was insane, I need your help and advice on how to be doing social, how to do social media. Because I started a social media agency. So I literally replied to him, what did I reply? Like, are you charging people? Yeah, are you charging people? I'm like, are you charging people? He goes, he goes, yes. I was just like laughing, I'm like, that's like me charging for skiing lessons and hitting up somebody and asking them to learn how to ski because I can't ski. Fucking bullshit. I'm sorry. Hey, dude. Oh, hi. Welcome in. All good stuff. Maddalena's on the phone. What's up, Matt? Hi, I'm the people who are who are you? It's Gary. I'm Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO. I feel like Vaynerchuk's CEO. We're just talking about performance reviews. I just went through a little demo here with... How'd it go? Well, yeah, well, yeah. I'm gonna make so much structure and profit. You're gonna love it. I don't mind. I can... Next phone call. Well, I wrote down today, or like, fix the well, don't fix the faucet. Fix the well, not the sink. Every time. It's great. Which is so important. That's it. Let me give you the manifesto on that. A lot of this is, I'm gonna be the bottleneck. So what I would say is, Office of the CEO should really probably write up, be very close to the write up of all these other things, because they're the closest to probably knowing where I sit in this. Steve's got creative down, and Jason and Aaron, I think I have video down. I can feel comfortable there, but all these other things. But let me give you an example of solutions. I wanna lead the dog to the well. I wanna basically say, we are often asked to help with digital work where the budget doesn't match the need of the amount of creative output for that. We have found over the last five years, one of the great services we can provide for our clients is creating a digital architecture and framework to how to be successful in the modern mobile world. Having a review right now, my intuition on the 90% wholesale, what we do best, what your company needs most. Let me give you, let us present to you, maybe tomorrow, right? Maybe two days, but no more than two days. Wednesday latest, how we do influencer, why we've been winning with Budweiser and Panasonic and others, and how we would attack this. Because Facebook commercial is more expensive and complicated because you get into creative, paid media amplification, why don't we go where there's less politics right now, and let us come with an influencer campaign for you. I'm married. How are you? I'm really pleasure, how are things? Glad we got to connect. Yeah, this is a sweet view. This is not too shabby. Moving on up. Yeah, tell me what's going on in your world, man. And how you're thinking about it. Yeah, no, it's a lot of fun. So I graduated a year ago, so I've been full time making videos for a year. I was doing it alongside school for all the previous six, seven years. Yeah, and then a lot of year fall and time. Yeah, yeah, so it's just been like an evolution of the, making videos about tech, consumer electronics, reviews, explanations, all that type of thing. Which is by the way so weird for me because that's the world I walked into. When I started Wine Library TV in 2006, the only videos online were that. I justine, Dignation, like, you know, like Techzilla, Leo Laporte. And that's where I, And that's where you were influenced, right? Yeah. Put your energy and forces behind pushing them to YouTube if that's where you decide the right places. You have zero downside of the distribution. There's, the entire universe is living on Facebook as well. And there's just no downside. So here's what I would say. You know, it's easy when you eat your own dog food. I care less about hitting the vanity metric of how many views on YouTube I have. I care about the net impact of the brand I'm creating. So to me, if you asked me what's better, 1 million YouTube videos and zero Facebook or 847,000 YouTube videos and 347,000, you're gonna win that game. Not to mention when you start thinking about real economics, like where you're really gonna get into real money. So one of the things that people, one of the reasons a lot of people come here is, if you really look at like the people that come and visit me and I hang with, so many of them have way more followers than me, but the economics I'm able to create are far greater. Cause that's how I think about stuff. When you think about who's gonna consume randomly your Facebook videos, they're the people that are gonna write the bigger checks. They're gonna be the people that are gonna come out and say, here's a $3 million sponsorship deal. That just matters. And in a YouTube environment, you've gotta go to it. In a Facebook environment, it comes to you. What I can tell you for sure is, you don't have to pick either or 99% of the time. There's so much fragmentation of attention. You can't lose the overexposure the way that people think. Good creators are romantic and are calculated around their art. And I do think that you can do both. And you're good looking dude too. I appreciate that. One, two, three. Come here. Yeah, it's me. Hit me up anytime. Hey everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk and this is episode 240 of the Ask GaryVee Show. If you don't have people to give the influencers and you want them to come on so they bring their audience, you've lost. You've lost. Unless you're getting the meaningful equity in your company, you've lost. Everybody, it's a chicken and a game to wreck. You know, like everybody wants, you want influencers because you want them to bring the million people that pay attention to them over and sign up for your world. No matter how much economics you give them, you're getting more than you're giving them in that first move, which means you'll never get started. You have to solve for that. You don't actually do it all, but when you aspire to do it all, you just get to a lot more of it than if you don't. I mean, right? Like if I decide I'm gonna run right now out of this car to California, like that is the goal and mission of my life. I just have a funny feeling that I'm gonna run further than somebody saying I'm gonna run down the block. This is war. So like, I think people are too perfect and too refined and are scared to lose because, and this is why I started with it, they care about what other people think. I don't care if VaynerMedia went out of business what you would say, ah, see, I knew it. You suck. No, I'm gonna rise like a phoenix and stick it in your mouth. It's an important insight and I'm glad you're responding to it the way you are because it's a big deal. Like I like losing because I'm not willing to factor you in to the equation and for me, losing is gonna teach me what not to do again. Hey, I'm getting upgraded. Yeah. Hey dude. Hi. Hi. Good to see you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. If we were to do this and we were to do it well, we'd be the number one brand in one year. It's that big. Like we'll invent, that's what I've always been good at. What I've always been good at is never taking the last medium and putting into the new medium, right? That's where people lose. Like if you look at the first 100 commercials, they were all radio ads. So obvious that I think it's been so heartwarming to think how many people here feel comfortable with what's happening now. I mean really to be very honest with you, given that I think I've peeled here before, theoretically, I'd love to do as much Q and A as possible right now to like really like, I'll give you a couple of top line thoughts. And then I'd love to answer any questions if you're wondering about like how I think about things or from my lens, I'm sure Ryan's giving you a lot of his stuff. But I think that the media landscape is gonna go through a substantial change. More so than it already has over the last decade. And I'm sure for a lot of you if you work here, you understand what that means in the scheme of things. I couldn't imagine progressing my career with not getting into the pure media side of things. But I think I can have a bigger impact than the companies I invest in or things of that nature. And so I'm excited to get to meet a lot of you and interact and take this journey together. And to me, when you sell a company, that shit is scary. You know what's been most interesting to me as this got close? After we had such a fun, like we had, like that was such a great meeting for me. I don't know what, I don't know how it was for you, but for me it was like so warm and so aligned and great question. It was so good. I remember thinking, fuck, if this happens, they're gonna feel safe and pumped. And so that excited me and I wanna deliver on that intuitive feeling that I think a lot of you, I mean, there was a lot of words that could have come out of Ryan's mouth of like, hey, we've sold too. That I'm sure for many of you, you've been debating in your mind if it happens. And I know for fact that the majority of the things that ran through your mind of where this company could be sold to were far less interesting than what we're about to be up to. And so that excites me. So that's my spiel. Cool, thanks for having me. See you soon. What? Something like, like who's doing what? But like, but what I do know is if you own that and you editorially executed it well, that the upside is so great. When you talk about the way I think about things, it's similar to the answer I gave you. A lot of what's gonna come out of my mind is if this hits, it changes everything. And I'm okay to go one for five because one for five is net positive. And I believe the world goes O for O. And that's just my general kind of, if you wanna understand where I think, like as a macro, I think the world goes O for O because people say nice and safe, do what they do, never push it because they're scared of going, oh, you know, missing. Because it's expensive, it took time, opportunity costs. To me, we are now in a place financially, infrastructurally, that we should try to do the ambitions that maybe some of you have on different things as well. And the other thing is, back to the point, I call it, like you should sponsor this for more and they're like, okay, like, you know, there's also that part. By the way, everybody's thinking about the one version of the thing they'd wanna do that they don't do. It's amazing when people are allowed to do that. Like the hustle meter goes through the roof if you're actually doing shit that you wanna do. Like for some of you, creatively, you're probably more than happy to do exactly what you're doing and do this thing as long as you're just allowed to do the thing. And you'll do that plenty afterwards because you just wanna see it through your creators. You wanna bring it to life. You know how curious you are if it would work? You know what I like about the thing? I'm just curious. I'm real curious. I also know it's the kind of thing that leads us to writing the number one book in America because I know that's where all the action is and God forbid we stumble on something. You think NPR knew that fucking podcast were gonna save their business? Promise you they did it. But if they didn't try, they would have never known. ["Mackerel Version"] No shit, but this is ready for this? This is a macro version of what I just told your editorial staff because we're in the yes business. We didn't know what the fuck. We just kept getting to a place where we're like, wait a minute. Pre-eaters has been asking me if I knew something like this but I was in a no business. ["Mackerel Version"] Bye guys, have a great night. Such a pleasure, take care. See you later. Bye guys. Bye, great to see you. Have a great night. Make sure if anybody ever feels like, it's very possible that you could have 39 things and you could have seven in six months. Like we need to be smart of how, yeah. ["Mackerel Version"] We're good. Thank you. Enjoyed it? Appreciate it, yeah. See you later. ["Mackerel Version"] For me, it's just about the journey of building businesses. It is my drug. It is my oxygen. I love it. I love that. I love this journey because I wanna see how we stack up with me involved against the other people that are trying to capture the attention. And so in essence, what it is, is one big game of how do I provide the most value so that in return I get the attention that I seek. ["Mackerel Version"] ["Mackerel Version"] Like how do I best build the best build thing, the best company for the people in it and for the people that are consuming it, which then creates a byproduct of it becoming the standard and even more interesting, how do I change businesses? I love resetting the rules of industries. It was so fun for me to change the wine business, which was a business that on the lower price point, there were low margins, but on premium wine over $30, there was all the margin. I came in and broke that, and I love the legacy of changing an industry. I love that. So for me, winning comes in two forms. Just building very, very, very large businesses. I call it honey empires, right? How do I build a honey empire? How do I build unbelievably successful, massive businesses in a honey way, the right way that's good for everybody involved, internally first and externally second, and then if I can leave a legacy that we changed it, like if my Wikipedia says, oh, and then he went into this business and now everybody does it this way, that's super interesting to me. Like breaking shit and reinventing it has legacy. I like the legacy of it. Thank you.
