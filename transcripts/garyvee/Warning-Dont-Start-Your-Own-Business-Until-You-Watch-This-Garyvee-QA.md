Most people, especially in today's age, are very comfortable blaming others, parents, government, bosses. The worst entrepreneurs blame their customers. People don't get us. I'm like, no, it's your job to do that. Like they might just find your new bagel, cranberry juice concoction not delicious. So accountability is huge. I think work ethic. I think a lot of people talk about wanting to be an entrepreneur because they see the, you can travel a lot. They think it's easy. It's harder. Like nine to five doesn't exist. One of the great things about working for someone else is you can turn off. So I think we're in the era now where we're demonizing social media. I mean, there's an apparent in America that isn't thinking about, you know, social media from a lens of negativity. So I think first social is gonna have to go through a rebrand. And I think it's gonna face a pill battle. I think the lack of accountability in parenting is gonna be a big challenge for social media. Yeah, people, it's easy to blame social media for the lack of parenting. Correct. And I think the political realities in our country also and the world are a challenge. So I think first, I think social is gonna be bumpy for the industry because of the judgment of society. Second, I think there's gonna be a lot of opportunity for social to really evolve. As it always does, you kind of see it evolving every two, three, five years because it's the nature of the beast. All it's trading on is consumers' attention. And so as a medium, unlike television where it was a set function and you knew what a television and magazine was and then what was changing, what was inside. So the content was changing. MASH was different than Seinfeld was different than the Flintstones was different than Rugrats and Beavis and Butthead, but the medium stayed the same. Whereas social, you've got seven or eight apps that dominate, they're all slightly different. But every minute, one of them can create a new feature or structure or a new one can come along. And I think that's pretty dynamic. And so my trends are I think people have to get better at it. That's why I wrote the new book. I think we're in a 301 course instead of a 101 course. Like what was good enough in 2015 to break out is not good enough in 2024. And I think people are becoming more scientific and practitionership and skill set and strategy matter more than ever to break out within the apps. And then in a macro, I wake up every day thinking something new is gonna pop up. So before we get to your book, do you have any advice when it comes to that for new content creators building their brand in such a saturated industry? That they have no fucking choice. People are like, oh, Gary, it's so saturated now. I'm like, okay, like what are you gonna do? Go cry in the corner. Right. You know, I mean. Or Carter. Yeah, and smarter, right? Yeah. And so I think this is the era of smarter. You know, you've just gotta be more creative, more strategic and I sense that. Great. So I mean, everybody wants to be an entrepreneur, right? I mean, you hear all these guys that I know, I'm gonna be an entrepreneur, I wanna work for myself. And there's millions of people. I have friends who call me every day. How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? What do you think the biggest habits are that differentiate successful entrepreneurs from those who are just kinda struggling and talks about it and just never execute? Accountability. You know, I think there's a level of accountability when you're a true entrepreneur, where most people, especially in today's age, are very comfortable blaming others, parents, government, bosses. I mean, the worst entrepreneurs blame their customers. You know, they're like. People don't get us. I'm like, no, it's your job to do that. Like, you know, they just might find your new bagel, cranberry juice concoction not delicious. So accountability is huge. I think work ethic, it's just real talk. You know, like, I think a lot of people talk about wanting to be an entrepreneur, cause they see the, you can travel a lot. They think it's easy. It's harder. Like, nine to five doesn't exist. Stress tolerance. I think that most people don't have the stomach for it. Like, one of the great things about working for someone else is you can turn off. Like, I don't know. Like, it's Monday morning. Like, I can tell you right now, my yesterday was not chill. I was thinking about 700 things that I need to attack and are a problem. So I don't think people have the stomach for it. I also think that for a lot of entrepreneurs, a differentiation is just sheer creative talent. Meaning, it requires ideas. Like, you have to have ideas. You have to innovate. You have to adjust. So, I think a lot. I mean, I don't think most people realize that almost everybody fails in their entrepreneurial venture. Yep. And I think it got cool in the last 15 years. Shit, I was a part of it becoming cool. And I benefited from it being cool. But I've been pretty consistent with my content of like, this shit's hard. I mean, there's been three failed magazines since I launched one that succeeded. So. And you know, what's fun about that is when you're a true bread entrepreneur, like even the way you delivered that, like for me, I was like, yeah. Like, I like the losing. Sure. You know? But for a lot of people, you know this. After the first failed magazine, they go back to corporate life. They go back. Yep, it's the soft cushy spot. I think there's a level of true humility that can't be seen in real entrepreneurs. I think you're right. Right? I think there's an ability to be judged. I think there's almost a respect for, I'm talking true entrepreneurs. I feel like true entrepreneurs respect the game. So when they're getting beat up, they're like, well, I deserve it. That's right. And so I think that those are the things that stand out, brother. So talk a little bit about your daily routine. I know you gotta have some little quotes here. First thing when you wake up, or maybe before you go to bed, is there anything that kind of helps you maintain, produce your rhythm, your creativity? Are you a gym guy? Are you, do you wake up and do yoga? What's your thing? I think mine is more macro than tactical, meaning I do go to the gym probably, you know, five to seven times a week. Like I try to get in there every day. Wow. But I don't think it's been like some remarkable, mental relief for me. It's been more about me wanting to live longer. You know, like just being thoughtful about health and wellness. Yep. You know, so that's not been it. I think it's been a general focus on perspective. Focus on perspective. I think for me, my ritual is really around gratitude. You know, in a real way. Like I've recently, multiple people, friends, family, are doing something similar. Like they have a gratitude journal, or they set an alarm to practice gratitude. Gratitude has become something I think people rightfully have realized has a lot of value, and that I don't think comes natural to most people. Yeah, that's huge. Yeah, so for me, a journal's great, an alarm is great. But like for me, I practice it pretty continuously. I would say what's basically happening in my body daily, my routine is even yesterday, when I bring up all the things that I was thinking about that I'm concerned about, I'm processing, and then after about 25 minutes, if that's daunting, because it can be, as you know, thinking through what you're quote unquote worried about. Pretty consistently, I'm almost, oh, I've got a good analogy. I'm doing like a, what is it like a slow drip? You know what, you get like a, what is that? Like a needle in you? Yeah, I feel like I'm slow dripping gratitude 24 seven. Okay. That is my, that's my actual process of doing, to me it's not meditation, it's not vacationing. I do focus on sleep very heavily. I think that's one misnomer about me. People see me very hyper, go, go, go, crush, go, attack, right, but that's me talking about how you play on the field. That's what I'm doing in my 12 hours. But, you know, but I'm a seven, eight hour sleep guy. Same. And I think that that's, plays such a huge role, being successful, to be honest. I think that I wouldn't be able to, like you wake up and have that, I have that energy like you have where I'm just go, go, go, if you're like, wow, that kid is just, he's on fire, he's so hyper. And then I'm crashing at the end of the night. If I don't get that, it shows. Yeah, I think same, you know, when I travel or serendipity and I've got five or, you know, I can, I mean, I'm not that same person. I'm not in a great game. Yeah. And there's never like, yeah, I mean, I've had consistent six in my career. I got there where I could like really function at the same level, but I feel different at seven and eight in a real way. So, you're new book. Yep. Day trading attention, which thank you for sending me a copy. And just to see that, so I'll be reading this. I've read quite a few of your books. This is a follow up to another book that you wrote. Yes. So let's talk a little bit about the book and kind of share with everybody what's inside and where the inspiration came from. I wrote a book 10 years ago called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. And it was really a book detailing how to do social media at the time. And I was still getting emails as of six months ago from people being like, I just read Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. Thank you so much. It's awesome. It's helped me so much. I'm growing 5,000 followers a month. And I'm like, Jesus Christ. I wrote that 10 years ago. More than 80% of that book needs a real update. So I felt compelled. This book was originally called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook. But as I got into it, I realized it was more of a macro thesis of what I do, which is day trading attention. And really it's a book that really outlines the state of the union of social media, what you need to be doing with creative to break through best practices per platform. Tons of examples of creative so that you can learn scenarios in the back. I'm pretty proud of it. Great. Yeah, I'm eager to read it. Like I said, I've read a few of your books and I'm a big reader in general. When it comes to anything that I can kind of further my education on this stuff. So this is said to be a good one. Yeah, I think I wrote it in a way that would really crush for people that have advanced skills. So this is definitely like, again, if I'm using a college curriculum, this is the textbook for the 301 course, not the 101. Great. But what has been my skill, even when I started in wine content and in business content is, I definitely have an average Joe way of talking that allows people to understand. So what I was excited about is, and it might really impact the way I write books going forward, I'm getting equal accolades from people that have done social media marketing at the highest levels for the last five years. And I'm getting accolades from people that are like two weeks into trying to become a famous florist, know nothing. And I think it's because I went there from a knowledge standpoint, but I still communicated it in a way that was understandable. Great. A little bit about your legacy, right? When you look back at your career, when people look back at your career, what do you hope that they're gonna say about you and how you've impacted the world or the industry? Yeah, I think from a macro, people that didn't really know me, I'd like to think that they felt that I gave more than I took, you know? I'm a big contributor to information for free, but I'm also comfortable selling things like wine and books and things of that nature. And then for the people that really know me, I want them to view me as somebody who is a good dude, like just, like, I think a lot about my funeral and the curiosity of like how many people decide to show up to it. And, you know, I'd like to live a life that compels people to go out of their way on a normal Tuesday and schlep over to wherever to hell I'm gonna get buried. And I think about that a lot actually. And so that's what I think about. That's great. All right, so we're gonna do a little round of fire. Call for your tea. You know what's funny? I like tea more, I consume more coffee. Okay, morning person or night owl. I think I know the answer to this one. Night owl. Really? Yes. You just completely threw me for a loop. I'll tell you this. I sleep, you know, I know why you would think that based on the sleep thing. But I prefer to go like, I like 8 p.m. to like one. Yeah, but if I work to one, I'll just wake up at eight or nine, but I'm much more, I'm much more. I can't do that because I have little ones. Little tiny ones who get me up at seven. Yeah, I get it. I'm much more productive late night. I like it more. I'm a momentum builder. So when I wake up, I've gotta like, yeah. I like, even though I go to the gym, I hate it. I like it. You got a favorite movie? All time. You know what, I bounce around about this. I'm not the most passionate, like Rocky IV excites me. Spaceballs. I think it's way up there for me. I'm gonna watch that at like summer camp when I was younger. Like Forrest Gump is like something I really like. I like that movie. So. comfort food, go to comfort food. What is it? Sunflower seeds. I love it. Two more. Dream dinner guests. If you can have any person or two people, if you have more than one, dead or alive, who's it gonna be? Have dinner with. Definitely both my grandfathers. I didn't really, I didn't know them. My grand, my dad's dad died when he was 15. My mom's dad died when I was four. And we left Russia when I was like three. And he died back in the Soviet Union. I don't remember him. I see pictures of me and him together, but that would disproportionately be number one. To have a dinner with my grandpas. A fun one is definitely Randy the Macho Ann Savage. Like. That is, I really regret that I didn't get to a point in my career where that became easy for me to meet him. He is definitely one of my favorite people in my childhood. I love it. Last one. Biggest pet peeve. Lack of accountability. I just, and it doesn't bother me because like I'm living my life. It's less about like people around me disappointing me because they lack accountability. It's, I just want more happiness in the world and there's a direct correlation to how accountable you are and how happy you are. And people just don't want to see it. Love it. I'm the man. So before I let you go, Gar. Yeah. Before I let you go, I watched the segment on you recently where you're throwing F bombs and you got the call from parents and the teachers and they were like, oh, your kid's saying fuck all over class. And you know, you were like, well, if that's the worst thing that happens, then you know, I don't see any problem with it. I watched that. I gotta tell you, I get shit from my wife all the time because I'm the guy who has no filter. And like you, those words are just in my vocabulary. It feels more real and more raw. And if my kid did get called one day because she said fucking school, I would say so what? I'm definitely not scared of teachers. I wasn't scared of them when I was in the class. I'm definitely not going to be fucking scared of them when I'm not in the class. This was great. Thank you, brother. Stay well, continued success. Cheers. Bye bye. Take care.
