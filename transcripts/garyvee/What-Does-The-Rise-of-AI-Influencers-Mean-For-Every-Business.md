Humans will not be able to compete with AI humans. At all. Nope, they're gonna be cheap. I'd rather pay an influencer that looks just like you and has just as many followers as you. I mean, there's real pressure coming. It's called virtual influencers. And... Meaning not real people correct influencers. That's right. And the Braithans have all sorts of feelings towards influencers. They pay a lot of money, then they don't post it the way they want, or do the thing they want, or do another brand deal with their competitor the day after the six month exclusive. So you know what they're gonna do about it. They're gonna create their own influencers. And the people that own the AI influencers are not gonna cry for the influencers. I think that industry is gonna get massively affected in the next 10 years. Attention is the number one asset. Okay, so your book, Day Trading Attention. The Greatest Book Ever Written. It's also the greatest book ever written. It's also the greatest book ever written as a manual for what the future of marketing, media, social, and marketing is gonna need and look like. Or even more to the point of the title, the Today. You know, I think one of the things that many of the people have been directs in my organization though, and many of the clients that I've interacted with in the room is there's this obsession with everyone thinking that these things are coming tomorrow. Like more stuff sold today because of social media organic and advertising than any other media drove sales today. So I think, obviously I understand you're setting it up but I took the opportunity to really pound this home to everyone. Day Trading Attention means that I believe marketing has shifted to something that is minute by minute, second by second, not let's sit around a boardroom for three months and come up with an idea that will come out in nine months. That world is super over. You know, I know there's a new Seinfeld movie on Netflix that has Don Draper coming back but he's super dead. And I think the industry is really struggling with Fortune 500, all the companies listed on NASDAQ are really struggling with marketing in my opinion and I think they have bad reporting. I think that they are confused. And I believe that until the world realizes that organic social media right now is the single most important thing to understand in marketing and then you build from there. Until that happens, we will see what we've been seeing which is on the flip side for every American Airlines or BMW, there are real significant businesses being built every day purely on social. And I'm not talking about the long tail of thousands of companies doing $5 million a year selling a health and wellness product or t-shirts or something on the side. I'm talking about the poppies, the prime energy drinks, the Mr. Beast Beastables. You're gonna start seeing multi-billion dollar revenue companies that are built purely from social. And that should make sense to everyone because a stunning percentage of the most famous people in the world right now came from and live within social. They're not actors and actresses in film and television. And so I think I'm excited that I put out this book now because I went very nerdy with it. I went into very heavy detail of like, okay, that's what I have to say. It's not, especially if you pay attention to anything I've said, it's nothing I haven't been saying for a decade. What I'm proud about with this book is I'm showing people how to really think about it. This is much more a classroom textbook than- Yeah, it's a real blueprint. I mean, I think I wrote it for my employees, to be honest. I'm trying to get 2,000 employees to do this properly. I'm like, you know what, I'll just write a book and make them read it on onboarding. Everything else hasn't worked. Maybe this shit won't work. Sounds like maybe you also wrote it for the Fortune 500 companies. And what it sounds like you're saying is that what kept companies competitive for the last, let's say 10, 15, 20 years is not what's gonna keep them competitive for the next two, five, 10, 15, 20. In a real way. Yeah, and they really need to catch up. So with that though, what do you think is the opportunity here to actually do it? Because there's, especially when you're talking about Fortune, you know, 100, 200 companies, there's a lot of old school systems. There's a lot of two year point about we don't need to sit for three months and build a strategy and then launch it in nine months. How do you think about mindset change and how do you think about real change within organizations to adopt this kind of thinking? I think real life, it's gonna come down to pain. You know, the real answer to your question, and I'd like to keep it real, is I don't believe they'll do it until they feel the pain that they're starting to feel. I believe that we have had more significant conversations. You know, I look at Kaylin Navery, who are my partners in crime in a lot of these combos and many others in this room. We've had more real, I mean, this week, last week, more real conversations where it's not just, hey, we need social media and like we'd like to work with you like it's part of our mix or we need it as a compliment, you know, to put it in food terms for everyone in here that's not deep in this vortex, on a good day, social media has been in a moose bouche. It hasn't even been an appetizer or a dessert and it's definitely not the main meal. What we're saying is it's the surf and the turf. It is the mainest meal there is. I would say we've had more conversations in the last month, two months this year, about okay, like we're ready to take this serious and it is only because they're feeling pain. They can smell it, they've got emerging brands taking market share or a church-ery competitor that out of desperation has gone into this and they can feel it and so what I love about this is I think merit is about to prevail. I think the answer to the question, I think it's gonna be pain and I think the reason they're gonna come to it is merit. Like for me, when all of you get to read the book, hopefully you will, I am only talking about social media because that's the biggest opportunity of underpriced-scaled awareness right now. As a matter of fact, in this nanosecond, I've just thought what I'm about to say. This book could actually become a dummy series for me. The subtitle's very important, this book. The book is called Day Trading Attention. I've done that my whole life. If I wrote this book in 2000, I'd be talking to you about websites, email, and search engines. When I look at this, it's called Day Trading Attention but then the subtitles had to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world. In the new social media world, I can replace that every five years. I can literally write this book in 12 years in the new VR world because, for example, social is incredibly vulnerable to VR because the second this doesn't become the primary device of our society, all of a sudden, social media becomes dramatically less valuable. That is what has happened to television commercials. The television that we all grew up with is a church-erary device now. You do not go to a television and turn it on and click channels between network and cable. That is gone. Even boomers, I love when people think this is all for kids, anybody here who is 70 or has 70-year-old parents know that half the content that their parents are consuming is YouTube. And at bare minimum, they're turning on a smart TV and they know how to go to streaming services. There's not a 95-year-old that doesn't consume a Netflix or a Hulu or a YouTube. It's over. And we are holding, like, unfortunately, companies are holding on because of politics and corporate bull crap. Yeah. Everybody's stock price downstairs should be more valuable if they stop releasing money. Then they waste more money on bad marketing than anything else they do. So you've been at the forefront as you're talking about social media and 10 years from now, you know, right now we're talking about AI. We can't really go anywhere without talking about AI, especially as it has to do with brand creative, you know, it taking over new ways to create content. We're talking about the fact that, you know, we're gonna be interacting with AI bots. What is, you know, five to 10 years if we were looking back, since you've always been on the forefront, what do you think we will say about AI as a point? You know, it's funny, I've been at the forefront predominantly based on my little rant for the last seven minutes. My forefront is I talk about today and the world is all about yesterday. So, you know, historically, even like all the images and quotes that have been running here today, they were said at the time. It's not like I said, you know, TikTok is gonna crush before it started crushing. I only talk about what's actually happening. So this question's always been challenging for me because I really don't predict. I just pontificate in the truth of the moment. That being said, of course, like any other human in here, I've thoughts, I try to debate it, I have pattern recognition, couple things. First, you know, the AI conversation is really interesting because it's almost like it feels to me like electricity. It's gonna be so omnie. If AI is not like an app, it's like the oxygen. Like, you know, I was in a meeting today around AI legal maneuvers that we wanna make as an organization and I was like, man, none of this is like, we're talking about it and already it's become so default. It's like, what is AI, right? And what I mean by that is automation and then profound automation, how it thinks for you, I see us in the meeting today talking about automation as AI. And so like, it's so big. And so I guess in five or 10 years, I think we'll stop talking about it the way we're talking about it now, the way that nobody here talks about the internet. You know, for everybody, who's over 42 in here, raise your hands. So everybody that just raised their hands, we used to talk about something called the internet. Like we would talk about it a lot. Like the internet's gonna, and the internet, and this internet, you know? And like, and we don't do that now, it's oxygen. And that's what's gonna happen with AI in 10 years. We're not gonna be talking about AI, it just is. And so it's that big. And I think every single human and every single organization will be massively affected by it. It's actually one of my greatest concerns as a human being right this nanosecond. It's almost like, you know, I think the thing that has worked for me, and what I admire in others, is when they can think about seven things, not one thing. So many people struggle because they look at things, they can only look at one thing at a time. And all the opportunity sits when you're able to take seven to 50 different data points and make a strong observation. Critical thinking. By the way, something AI may be able to take away as an advantage. You know, what I think is really interesting is, I'm incredibly concerned that we live in a day and age where the human is more thoughtful than ever about work-life balance, mental and physical health. And it's actually beautiful. There's so much good about that. You know, obviously I'm a very well-documented, I love the grind, but that's only because I'm passionate about what I do for a living. Like, when I'm not passionate about it, I don't wanna do anything. There's a reason I was a poor student. There's a reason that I don't do things around the house. Like, if I don't like it. Well. You know, but I think this is really an interesting insight. Like, if I don't like it, I don't wanna do it. I have no passion for it. I'm giving it zero effort. So obviously I'm very well-documented in believing in hard work and going hard and all this, because I love it. I'm thrilled when people want to find their balance. I feel like I have my balance. Balance is individual. But here's a very, very important conversation that's about to hit its head. At a time where people are not interested in going to the office, are looking for more time than ever, we're gonna have a problem. That problem is humans are gonna be replaced by AI. And companies are gonna do it. Just like we did with tractors on farms. Farms used to employ everyone. Almost everybody on earth. Only a couple hundred years ago worked on it and was employed by a farm. And then tractors came along and you didn't need as many people. This beautiful city. Do you know how many people used to be employed here 120 years ago to clean up cow poop? A lot. But then the car came along and we didn't need to ride horses anymore. Thus, rendering are not needing people to go around this city and clean up horse poop. There's not a creative person on earth that is a Mason. An architect and a Mason are two different things. If you sit in this room or you're watching this video or you're listening to this and you're the idea person, good news. AI is about to become your partner in thinking. But if you are not the idea person, if you're the person that opens up Adobe and you make it, it's game over. And a lot of people do that for a living. And when I say that, I'm not happy about that. I'm not, I actually not happy, not sad, not pro, not con. It just is. My question is, every single Adobe designer or video editor knows that to be true. So no, Matt, what I just said was not some sort of like, that's impossible. We actually know it to be true. There's unlimited videos that are viral on the internet right now that were made in one second that are profound. They used to cost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars and take 20 people. My question is, if you do that for a living and you know what I just said is true, what are you doing about it? And so I'm worried that we have this conversion, two things happening at the same time. At worst, an enormous amount of entitlement by human beings in first world countries. And at best, people being thoughtful about what they want in life and what balance they want. But all of it, there's one, technology's the best. But it also has one thing that is very, very challenging. It doesn't care about our feelings. And so this is gonna be, and it is gonna reshape our society. And I went through this five minute rant to beg someone who hears it, who is in the business of what AI is about to commoditize to challenge themselves, to put themselves out of business before AI does it. And what I mean by that, if you don't understand is adjust. I think about it. My agency gave it, it's paid lots and lots of money to make creative. So I think about this every day and I think all of us should. And it goes pretty far. One of the things, I don't think I touched on, no, I don't think, maybe I touched on a book. We're all blurs together, but virtual influencers. Like everyone who's an influencer right now who's really winning is loving life. That turned out to be a great job, right? I mean, there's real pressure coming. It's called virtual influencers. And- I think not real people- Correct, that's right. And the brands have all sorts of feelings towards influencers. They pay a lot of money, then they don't post it the way they want, or do the thing they want, or do another brand deal with their competitor the day after the six month exclusive. So you know what they're gonna do about it? They're gonna create their own influencers. Why not? It's not only why not, they should. This is the thing that I found incredibly interesting about everything in life and definitely in marketing and business. People act as if they're owed something. The fuck are you owed? Nothing. This is business, this is merit. This is, you know, every influencer that got paid $1 today took that out of an actual celebrity 15 years ago. That's where that money went. So we're not crying for them. And the people that own the AI influencers are not gonna cry for the influencers. I think that industry is gonna get massively affected in the next 10 years. Humans will not be able to compete with AI humans. At all. Nope. They're gonna be cheap. I'd rather pay an influencer that looks just like you and has just as many followers as you for $5 a post instead of what you mean. I don't think people understand how profound this is going to be. What do you think? It sounds from what we were talking about earlier about companies, fortune, you know, the big companies that need to adjust. It sounds like people need to adjust too. When do you think, you said pain for companies? 99% of people change when pain happens. And the 1% wins. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for being here. You're welcome. Before we wrap up, we try to ask everyone this question or I do at least not we. If you suspend reality and you had a billion dollars not to put it down payment for the jets but to use it to spend to solve some kind of problem, what would it be? Clean water. Clean water. This goes back to today. By the way, there's unlimited amounts of good answers to this question. The truth is, I'll give you my real practical one that I just gave you and I'll give you one fantasy one. Clean water because as we sit here today, 850 million people, more than 10% or 10% of our society cannot get to clean water in 12 hours. Women, which is the craziest part of this whole thing, women around the world, predominantly in Africa, parts of India, parts of Southeast Asia, walk 12 hours with a bucket on their head and fill it up with clean water and bring it back. I look, there's so, I mean, I don't think this is gonna confuse anybody. There's 8 trillion injustices that we can think about. I just can't get over this one. Everyone, we're all allowed to latch onto something. It's just something that I would like to see fixed. It's on the board of Charity Water, or well-membered as they call it. And I'm really passionate about it. Look, we can disagree. Everyone could see the world differently. I just wanna get these people water. Do you know how non-functional things are when you don't have that? You wanna get into female hygiene and birth rates and diseases. This is what gets me crazy about like America, my favorite place, by the way. Flawed, but everything is flawed. Like, people complain about ridiculous things. Somebody probably complained that they missed the elevator up here just now and had to get the next one. Like, we just get upset about things that matter nothing. And there's 850 million people. Now, my fantasy one, I would try to take that money and start to try to create, this is actually a movie cut. I'm gonna pitch this to everybody. I have this movie idea. I've done any jobs, so tell them. This is why I started VaynerWatts secretly. I think I have Oscar in me. I wanna make a movie that has a theory that it's a really interesting opening scene to the movie. It's like the, you know, acting fake presidents and heads of like the health departments of Russia, China, America, India, like the world powers. And it's like confusing that they're all together because it's during these times where obviously everyone's fighting. And they call this world order like press conference to announce that they have figured out how to inject and extract personality traits. But yeah, I'm really excited about it. So please go to Fandango and download your, and so basically the movie really plays out interestingly like what happens when everyone's the same and different. But the reason I brought it up is this is like very tangible. The one that's least tangible is I think everything starts to work that everyone's worried about. Race, gender, countries, everything you care about, everything you talk about. I think all of it gets fixed. The second we attack insecurity. I believe that the biggest issue in the world is that humans are predominantly insecure. And that leads to envy and jealousy and unhappiness. You know, I just wish people genuinely could love themselves. And so I wanna create a vaccine that instills actual self-esteem while it extracts insecurity. Because I genuinely believe if that happened, then everybody would get this fantasy world that you dream about. The answer to the quiz, my friends, is insecurity. It drives everything. And on the flip side, all the good comes from pure self-esteem. You want your kids to be able to deal with social media? It's not deleting TikTok off the phone. It's that building actual self-esteem. The way we talk about social media today is the way that we talked about alcohol in this country in 1925. You can ban it, you can do anything you want. That's not the solution. The solution is understanding how to handle it. We are so incapable of handling judgment from other people that that's what's happening. So that's what I would spend a billion dollars on. I love that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
