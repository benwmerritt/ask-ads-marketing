What I'm more scared about is the companies that are building the best tech. I'm not sure they're going to be as gracious as Google and want to give away the business. When you type in, I need a plumber, they'll take your money. When someone types in, I'm looking to buy a new home in Bristol, I'm not so sold that chat GPT is going to send you to a real estate agent. I think they're going to send you to their real estate agent. Yeah, Google started free, chat GPT started with money. You got to sign up, you got to pay right from the beginning. And that's because the tech was so expensive in the processing, but we all know this. All tech starts off expensive and gets cheaper. I think we're going into a very dangerous era of big tech, where they're going to be like, fuck the nickels that come along with advertising. We're going to take the whole funnel. So for the people that are most advanced here, there is weights to do SEO on chat GPT and good news. This is why I'm yelling at you for social media. Chat GPT and whoever else wins, whether they win or somebody else, whoever the Google is or the Facebook is of the AI era, I have good news for you. They're going to be very happy to take your money. I'm more worried that we have to build brand because when I, I don't want to be at the mercy of people like this going to chat GPT and say, hey, chat GPT, I've got an entrepreneurial question. Let me ask you this. I want them to be like, hey, chat GPT, what would Gary Vee think about this? I'm out here trying to build brand. Got it. Got it. Brand. Hey, Alexa, send me a pizza. No, no, no. Hey, Alexa, send me a pizza hut. Send me Domino's. Everybody in here is looking to build a brand because if you do not build a brand, you will become a commodity. I, I've built the biggest business coaching company in the world. A thousand offices, 84 countries, two and a half billion dollars in sales. I still don't want to be famous. My company should be a lot more famous than it is. The people we help, the way we help them. I'm the most private public person on earth. I don't share my life. I'm exactly like you. I have no interest in people being in my life. My family is sacred. My personal life is sacred. I put out content about business. That's number one. Number two, you still don't even have to do that. You can make your business famous to your point. You still don't even have to become the face or famous, but you need your business to do a much better job in being a brand and build a brand. Nobody knows who Johnny Coca Cola is. Coca Cola markets. You don't know the IBM CEO or founder. You know IBM, right? You don't know, you know, Salesforce. Spark Betty office, pretty known. Way more people know Salesforce than no mark. So you just need to make the business market date. Your business needs to put out 20 to 30 pieces of content a day throughout social. You don't have to. And you can do occasional stuff. The clip from this can be clipped and used. And so I think there's ways to do it. Do you see? I think from a logical standpoint, I can get all that. But being a little more esoteric at heart, I know that there's a way that if I don't want to do it, it doesn't matter how much content I put out. If in my heart I don't want that to boom, it's not going to boom. Brother, I don't like anything. I hate working out. And eating well. I hate it. But I do it because it's right. I don't give a shit about your feelings, brother. I care about your business. You don't have to do it. You have to hire someone to do it. All right. You've all heard the advice. Makes sense, right? Oh, it makes a lot of sense. And I don't know if it's also a bit of the Australian in me. Like I watch, you know, other guys, I won't name them, but I'm not the guy that stands up there and look at me in my freaking jet. Dude, if you're that rich, you shouldn't be showing photos in your private jet. By the way, by the way, I'm that rich and there's zero photos of me in a private jet. I'm with you. I'm not a douchebag either. But some of them are. It kills me at the highest levels. If I do any of that, all my Australian buddies call me up. What? Dude, what was that shit? Why on earth would you do that? I don't know. Some days I read Gary V books and it tells me to just keep putting out content. Yes, you're exactly right. But it doesn't say put out douchebag content. Again, if you're really looking at how I do it, I do none of that. Yeah. I don't I don't even have a piece of jewelry on. I think the shirt's like nine bucks. Like that's to your point. Some people sell the lifestyle. Other people live it. I'm a confusion to a lot of people. Thank you. I'm a confusion to a lot of people when people come and visit me at VaynerMedia and see 2000 employees, half the people that just raised their hands think I'm a motivational speaker. I run businesses. You do as well. I admire that. I think that's the content you put out. By the way, just so you know, unlike a lot of other people to your point, all the advice I just gave for the last 45 minutes, I do that. Hmm. Everything I just talked to you about, just so you know, in a world of many speakers that talk about shit they don't do, everything I just told you about one on one time with employees at scale. Content every day at scale. I'm going to show you something. This is my WhatsApp. This is where my team and I make the content. That is me. That is me writing the copy to the content that I put out. This is me with my team. I wrote the copy. I'm still writing the copy on my social media posts. I'm in the fucking trenches. I'm in the dirt. I'm in the dirt more than most of you get to do the bits though that you love still. You don't have to do the bits. You don't love as much anymore. This is what I'm trying to tell you. This is why I'm doing this little shtick. You don't have to do the content on social. I don't do the contracts of my company. Yeah. I've signed 45,000 contracts probably in the last five years. I've read none of them. I'm being dead fucking serious. But I have Mark Yudkin who's my brother. Not my actual brother, but he's been with me now for 20 years. That's it. Fucking figure it out. But I am but I am certain someone's going to play that clip back to me. Every fucking year for the next like forever. You know, I'll tell you why I'm passionate about it. I love you for it. I love that you don't want to do what I also don't think is good, which is you're tricking kids and thinking Lambos and watches. That's not what this is about. What I why I admire so much about the people in this room is a lot of them are not doing it for the Lambo and the private jet. They're doing it because this is who we are. We're fucking business people. We're entrepreneurs. So. Charging more charging what you worth being the top of the tree, not trying to be the competing on price people thoughts. Always until the market says go fuck yourself. Right. Like like the concept of not constantly trying to get more money for what you do is crazy. Why wouldn't you because the market is the market when you're like, I mean, this is how speaking worked. The first time I did a speaking gig 15 years ago, I get this email. They're like, would you like to give a speech? I'm like, that sounds cool. It was like I was running a wine store at the time, but I was starting the Internet thing, right? They're like, do you want to come and give a talk? So I'm like, yeah. I'm like, yes, I'm in there. Like it's in Florida and whatever. I just thought it was like cited to get asked to speak. He then replies. He's like, how much do you charge? I'm like, fuck, you can charge for this. My first ever gig, Robert Kiyosaki took me to Hawaii. I was a 20 year old kid and he goes, what's your speaking fee? I said, what's yours? He said this much. I said, same as mine. Mine was pretty funny. So now I get the email from this guy. It's like 2006. He's like, what's your fee? Now I'm sitting there looking at this email. This was pre-laptops and cell phones, big monitor. I'm looking at this thing and I'm like, okay, because I'm no dope. Back to the answer I'm giving to everyone here. I'm like, I got to come up with the biggest fucking number I could ever imagine to give a speech. And I reply, I'm like, $5,000. The guy replies in two seconds to that email. He's like, done. I'm like, fuck. And the way I got to my price was I kept going. And then the market told me, you're not that guy yet, Gary. Right? When I got to that 25K number, at that point in my career, they were like, that's it. Because every time I said 30, 35, 40, it was no, we're going to go in a different direction. And I was like, respect. The one thing I love about this conversation is this is a humbling, fun process. Don't be insecure about this. Don't be scared to ask. But when they tell you, no, don't be offended by it. Just keep asking for more. The market will tell you what you're worth. Where people get this screwed up, brother, is they're like, I know my worth. I'm worth more. I'm like, no, you're not. Nobody's paying you. But you need to ask for more as often as possible. And don't stop. The other mistake people make is they get excited about what I just said. They get motivated. Whatever they charge in the next time they charge more, the first person says no, and they go right back. You need 10 nos, seven nos before you've really figured out your price. The first time someone said no to me at 30K, I'm like, you know, because then another no, then another. And then I had to look myself in the mirror one day and be like, OK, you're a 25K speaker now. And obviously that's evolved. Well, yeah, I know how much it's evolved. Quite well, in fact. Thank you, sir. But this goes back to why I want you to build more brand. I want you to be in a place where you can fill out 10 times this many people without needing, you know, to use keynote speakers like brand is brand is brand. And it doesn't have to be. Well, how would I do that? Well, it the more just put out more content. That's right, because then you're going to have more. That's right. And more people are going to be your fans. And then this becomes double the size because they're there to see you, which gives you more leverage to not have to get a top top. Like it's the game. Yeah, it's the game. How do you see resilience for us as business people? Like oxygen, the greatest thing about entrepreneurship and owning your business is you have no choice. Every single person here is actually delivering on a level of resilience that is not found in society. Because if they weren't, they'd be out of business and they wouldn't be here. It is my great admiration that I have for all of you, because all of you know what I know. And I've known it since I was 20 years old. The buck stops with you. If you aren't resilient, if you're not adaptable, this is what I'm talking about. The entire talk I just gave is strictly about adaptability. I know that they're about to feel pressure for the optionality of their employees. So I'm trying to get them to care about their employees a little bit more, because that's going to create more retention. I know that the biggest way to grow their business by a country mile with no money is social media creative. But when it comes to resilience, that's my great admiration of this room. That's all they know. Otherwise, they go out of business. Actually speaking of, so we've been in business coaching now for 31 years. Your thoughts on coaching, having a coach? I'm a huge fan of that concept. I think it all depends. Like for example, in business, I never had a coach because it was my God-given gift and I learned more by losing. So to me, my brain does not process how to be great at business from a coach because I need to taste it. I need the L's. But many far more successful business people than me 100% attribute their success from coaching. I needed everywhere else in my life, whether it's therapy, whether it's personal training, whether like, so I'm incredibly bullish of someone looking from the outside in. By the way, I would benefit from business coaching financially. I just like scraping my knee and banging my elbow in business so much that I keep it away, but it is not lost on me. There are many things in my own game that a cook and I could see it. You know, you all know this, right? You could see the flaws in everybody in your family, but you can't see your flaw. You know what mom and dad and your siblings and your spouse suck at, but you can't see yours. If I had a coach, for example, and be very vulnerable, my kryptonite, which is crazy. Some people are going to laugh right now. My kryptonite in business has been candor. Gary V on stage is very good at candor. Gary Vaynerchuk, the human being, is so into the stuff I told you about employees. I get into family vibes with my employees. Like, you know those lover boys that like fall in love at first sight that you know, like I'm like that in business. You like work for me for like a week. I'm like, you're fucking I can't help it. I'm just very team, very family. But what that created was the more I liked you, the harder it was for me to tell you the truth about what I thought you were as an employee, which led to me working around it. I would always be very like giving on the way out. I would have to get years of resentment before I finally had the courage to fire you. And then I gave you a huge severance and you haven't done shit for two years. And now I'm giving you a huge severance. And the worst part of all, you're then mad at me because I never told you. And I surprised you because on Thursday, I'm like, Brad, you're fucking the best weekend. And then Monday, I'm like, hey, Monday, come in and come like, you're the fucking best. Literally Thursday, you're the fucking best. I fucking love you. Hey, by the way, Monday, come in. You come in Monday, I'm like, Brad, we're going to let you go. What? Yeah. And so candor was my kryptonite. And it took me 20 years. And I would tell you as I sit here today in a world where I'm a 10 out of 10 and a nine out of 10 and so many things in business, on a good day, I'm still a five and a six out of a very important trade of a leader. And I work on it every day. If I had a coach, I think that would have been addressed much earlier. Yeah. Fun thing, the jets, the New York jets, not that fun. Lately. No, no, very fun. How many people here are proper football fans that are diehards of their team? Raise your hand. What about of any sport who here is a diehard fan of a sport? Raise your hands. So here's the weird thing about me. And this is why I'm such a good entrepreneur. I love my New York jets, my American football team so much. They have not won a championship since January 12, 1969. They fucking suck. But I like that part. See, all the scrape the knees and the New York jets, it makes sense. Got it. I, I grew up a New York Yankees fan. Yeah. When they won my first championship with them in 1996, I never watched another game. Really? Really. I actually make fun of all the fans of very successful teams. I feel like you get your self esteem from their victories, but you're not doing shit. I love the pain. I love the grind. I love the hardship. I love when people make fun of me about the jets. I love that shit. I'd love you to help us out with our foundation at some point, because we educate kids for free to leave school and be an entrepreneur. In. Because, yeah. In. That's a in. Yeah. You'll email me in. In fact, I might have mentioned it earlier. I actually don't think I brought this up. If I may for a second. Yeah. The thing I'm actually working on right now in my career is the thing I'm most excited about that I've ever done. I've started something called V friends, V E friends, v friends.com, especially if you have somebody under 10 in your life, you should go look at it. It is my Pokemon. It is my Disney. It is my Marvel. And it's 250 characters, patient panda, you know, accountable aunt, competitive clown. And it is strictly built to help along with the parenting that is so challenging in today's world. And a lot of it is targeting the kids that should not go to university and should be entrepreneurs. There's plenty of kids that should go to school. They're built like that. But, but we got into this place in the last 40 years that everyone should go to university and college, which is insanity. And in America, it's a real problem. So bad. Because at least in most parts of the rest of the world, the government pays for it. In America, these kids are going into massive debt. To get a piece of. My eldest daughter, 350 grand to go to college. My ROI on that negative 350. Of course, 100 percent. It's it's a joke for half of the but I wanted to work with my great friends. You guys all know the Irwin family, Australia's Steve Irwin, Krakat Alhonda. She goes and works with Terry and Bindi and Robert. She's getting the best lessons in life working for real entrepreneurs, real planet savers. She's working with them. Robert, she's a photographer. Robert's taking her under his wing, teacher to photography like that's better to me. And that's why I'm smiling because the creative set should never go to university. It's not built for that. It's built to make workers.
