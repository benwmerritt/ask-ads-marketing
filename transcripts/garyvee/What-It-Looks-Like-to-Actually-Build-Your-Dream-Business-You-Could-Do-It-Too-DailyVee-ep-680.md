## Transcript
All of you are sitting here watching the next Marvel, UBO, Pokemon, Disney being built in front of your face. I really believe it. Really nice day here in Orlando at CollectiCon, building out the brand, person by person. I think of the rise of AI, the people that are gonna win are the ones that do the most in-person stuff. The shrewd mother of the shark. Right, these, the cars. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] I don't think we've even started yet. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] The last four years, I've also had other companies that I've had a lot of responsibilities on. I run a 2,500-person global advertising agency. As I sit here today, we're literally in the moment where we being the CEO of this company will become the primary focus of my career. I grew up in the 80s with Transformers and Care Bears and G.I. Joe and Star Wars and all these incredible brands. When the NFT thing happened, I said, this is an opportunity for me to maybe create my own world on the principles and things that I'm passionate about around gratitude, around being driven and all these characteristics. And so I took a stab at it and through kids' books, through comics, through cartoons, and through trading cards, we're in the early stages and hopefully in 15, 20 years from now, it's not just our booth that, as V-Friends, it's all these booths. And so that's the journey I'm on. How'd you get the top-stream deal? What's hard to do? I was at the National and there was so many people at our booth that they came over and they're like, hey, what are you doing? I'm like, what are you doing? We got the deal done and so it's been huge. It came out two weeks ago and it's been really going well. Open it, it's for you. Open it right now. Yeah, it's for you. I hope this is the worst pack ever. Come on, man. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What's wrong with you? Shrew shark, shrew shark, okay. Oh! Flamingo, perfect version cat, solid. The comics are going well, the cartoons are going well. Like, it's so fun to build. How do you get like a TV show out of this? We got a YouTube kids show that's done extremely well. So brick by brick. You have been an inspiration. I am. Thank you. And I am back to life after 40 years. Thanks to you. Thank you. You're like halfway there and that's stick to me. Good man, good. I want to thank my daughter, she's 10. Yes. I want her to be patient. Yes. So patient's panel are going to take us here. I love it. Global wizard is going to take us there. It's a pleasure to meet you. That's a pleasure, man. Thank you so much. My govind is to pass it to my daughter and her to Neri's. That's it. I don't think that brands have done a very good job in the last 20 years helping parents. I think they've been good at taking money from parents, teaching human beings these characteristics, turning these characters into popular pop culture that then allows all these parents to talk to their kid about resilience or being fearless or being driven or being accountable. This is really important stuff. Parenting is hard and it's gotten harder in this world. And I feel like when I was growing up, when I watched GI Joe cartoons at the end, the GI Joe character would give us a lesson and say, and now you know, right? That is a very big foundation of the friends. So what's these guys? I doodled every single character originally to like establish it. So I had like real provenance. Provenance, that's great. I don't know how you guys signed these. Bro, I got you. I can tell my front of the back. Love you, bro. I was loved. Literally, been watching you for like 15 years. I've about 10 or 11 years since my own entrepreneurial journey. I wanted to ask you, did you feel when things were about to pop for you? Yes. I'm like bright hair. When you were not looking for it to pop, when it's just your fucking day to day, when you weirdly, and this is interesting, this is like sick of me, but it's real. When you're equally okay in the dark as you are in the sun, well then that's when you become completely unstoppable. You know, from the invention of the friends, from the second that I thought about creating it, I knew I signed up for a 50 year journey. You know, I do think in Walt Disney's Stanley, Jim Henson, you know, framework. So being four or five years in now, it feels very rewarding because I feel like we're starting to get traction. Honestly, it's still very early. I know the Topps Chrome launch is a monster, and I know that we'll always look back at it as a big deal, but I'm definitely not celebrating. I don't think we've even started yet. I feel like this conference hall and garage sales and flea markets is like my natural habitat, you know? Like where my chemicals feel most at home and a liquor store and a stage in front of tens of thousands of people. They're all the same. They're very cozy environments for me. There's two things you wanna be winning on, width and depth. Width is you wanna go as wide as possible. Post three times a day, seven different platforms. Go on podcasts, do a YouTube show, just be everywhere. Then all the way on this side is one by one, non-scalable behavior. Depth, get to know people. Six minutes with somebody who's potentially talking gibberish, but you're there for them. I think that what I've done well and why I'm so confident and be friends is I'm gonna do both. I'm gonna make deals with Topps Chrome and be in every store and UNO and do the cartoons and do all the width stuff at scale while equally going to things like I just went to where I'm literally going to talk to 49 people, 72 people in an eight hour window giving all my energy, all my grind, all my attention, all my efforts. It's what I do on DM. It's why I reply to people who text me. It's why I stop and say hello. It's why I acknowledge people when they're like, yo, my man, the old saying of shaking hands, kissing babies. I really believe in that stuff. And honestly, I think that when people start out, some of the people that have amassed millions of followers, millions of dollars, when they start out, they do it. They believe in that. And then it gets harder for them. They start to sell out and they just care about the width. They just want scalability. And they're gonna have automation with AI and all this. I think in the rise of AI, the people that are gonna win are the ones that do the most in-person stuff, do the zooms one-on-one. I think it is my secret weapon. That's why there's a V-friend called the worm from the dirt. And I feel like I'm a worm in the dirt. Like, today's a Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. And I, you know, I'm doing what I'm doing. Today was successful. Like, you know, he shows every day that we can onboard more people to discover the characters, to know the characters, is a winning day. All right, I'm very late. Bye, guys. So we're wrapping up this little series of DailyVee. Huge shout out to Jason, Stefan, Babin, D-Rock, Caleb, and the whole gang. It just feels incredibly fun to be back in the vlog. It feels incredibly fun to be in the trenches in the early days of something significant. I know I'm building a monster with V-friends and to do it in a manner that I most respect, which is like really grinding it out and doing it day to day, even at this point in my career. I'm just proud of the way my parents paired to me. That's that. That's the way to end it. Thank you. Love you, brother. Love you too.
