## Transcript
You know, I look at the lights in your studio right now. You know how like in the summertime, like those lights that buzz, I always think about those little mosquitoes or things that go into the light. They can't help it. I was wondering if they like know they're about to get zapped and die. And that's how I feel about entrepreneurship. I think I was purebred. I think I was born into it. It wasn't envy or need. I see so many people motivated by, they had it hard and they saw money as the way out. And it was a chip on their shoulder. I don't have a chip on my shoulder. I have a curiosity in my stomach. You grew up with the gene, entrepreneurial gene. You had a lemonade stand at six years old. You thought about franchising. You did franchise. You set this up on a street called Tingley Lane. Tingley Lane. Yeah, I mean, just to make it clear for everybody, franchising was spending the whole day commencing my other friends to stand behind the lemonade stand so I could like pick up the cash at the end of the day. You sang Christmas Carols as a Jew. Yes. So how does a do and- That's Robbie Ternick's favorite. This is the favorite one. Silent night. I got it all. Go ahead. Go ahead and sing a verse. No, no, no, I'm done. That's all I got. And this one is the one that I find most interesting. You pick flowers in your neighbor's yard and then you went back and you sold them the same flower. So how did you do that in particular? And are entrepreneurs who aren't born with the gene as successful as those who are born with the gene? No, they're not. I mean, they're just not. And I'll say, I'll jump to that part and I'll go back. Let me tell you why I believe that. I believe that anybody can get better at anything, but I do think talent is a real life thing. How can we not believe that? Back to me not wanting to go more verses, I promise you, if I sounded like fucking Aretha Franklin, I would have finished that song. You know, so, you know, to me, this concept that entrepreneurship is not a skill is a ludicrous one, if anyone believes it, which I don't think most people are confused by that. And so I believe everybody in this circle, I'm looking at everybody in the room right now, right? I believe eight of us all got different things. And entrepreneurial talent is one of them. And by the way, somebody in this circle who's less successful entrepreneur than you and I might actually have it. I think having it also draws you to it back to the bug in the light, but let me play devil's advocate, but they didn't put in the hours against that talent. Like I, my brother loves golf now over the last 10 years. He's so frustrated that I won't take it up because he knows that the eight or 10 times I've played with him and he knows by the other sports we play with each other, I'm probably more naturally gifted at golf than he is. Right, I have a more natural swing. My hand-eye coordination is better than AJ's. He's got better skill sets and basketball and things of that nature, but in purest form, I think if he was sitting here, he would say, because he says it all the time, so I know he believes it, Gary has more natural skill in it, but I've only played 10 times, he's played 10 times in the last month. He's better at golf. I think that people that do not have a ton of entrepreneurial natural talent can be incredibly successful entrepreneurs because they put in the work. But do I believe that if I was matched up with somebody who has less or more natural entrepreneurial talent, and we all put in the same amount of work that there's a higher propensity that I would have that success? Yeah, I believe that. I think talent's part of the entrepreneurial equation. And then selling flowers that you picked back to a neighbor? You know, I love telling that story. It's actually one story. It only did it to one neighbor. She was the best. I probably understood she liked me so much that she was willing to buy her own flowers for me. But yeah, I mean, painting rocks. Like when you have nothing, you're trying to sell something. Even lemonade was a little bit of a stretch. For me early on, because my mom wouldn't want to buy lemonade picks. So, you know, rocks. The biggest ones were washing car and shoveling snow. They were real gifts to me because they just required work. We had a hose. You know, and so, but the flowers won. John, next door, they were a very nice couple. They were right next door to us. And she had flowers and yeah, one day I ripped them, ripped some of them out of her yard and rang her doorbells if you want to buy this. And she did. I wish I had the video of that because I can't remember all the details. I have a funny feeling. She had a funny smirk on her face and wanted to support me, which means a lot to me. So let's talk about, did not having money motivate you to be successful? And what's your advice to kids who grew up with a lot of money who may not be as motivated? Because I've seen it both ways. Our summer intern program is 32 kids, about half have money, half don't have money. And I've noticed throughout my career, a lot of the kids that have money, they'll say, oh, I don't need to work this hard or I'm unhappy at my job, I'm just gonna leave and I'll find something else. It's a very complicated question as you know. I'm sure based on your background in mind, we've given us a lot of thought, especially when you have children. And have done well. And your kids are raising a different environment than we were. And you can't fake environment, right? And to your point earlier, it's hard to be hungry when you're constantly fed. And money gives you optionality to be able to choose. I don't wanna grind through this. And the ability to deal with adversity and to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations is probably the most important skill set one can learn if they wanna enjoy life, period. Peace of mind and lack of anxiety and content are far more interesting than private planes and Rolexes and houses and Cabo. So what do I think? Do I think not having money motivated me to be successful? I don't think so. Let me explain. One of the things that's interesting about growing up in Russia or the Soviet Union, and then Queens in the housing projects, and then Dover and then Edison, I didn't even know what money was. Meaning when everyone around you doesn't have shit either, and you're pre-internet, and you're not really watching a lot of TV, like you don't know. So when I think about that, and then I think about, I definitely did not know we didn't have money when I was six, when all I wanted to do was have a lemonade stand. I definitely did not know, I actually thought we were good. Like real good, we had a, you know, my dad really grinded. And so like, I don't know, like, we were in the mix. We weren't the, there was kids that I went to school with that literally didn't have lunch money, you know, that wore the same clothes, that smelled. Like I, like I grew up in a lower middle class. I wouldn't say ghetto or poor, but like poor for sure at first. So anyway, punchline being, I did so many money making activities long before I had any context of money, or where we sat, or what was out there, or what was possible. And then even when I learned like what a Mercedes was, when I was 11, it never crossed my mind that I wanted one. I still have never had a real high end car. What do you drive now? Nothing, I have a driver, so that's even like, more ridiculous than a Cayenne car. But like the, when I bought, when I had money, you know, I got a Jeep Grand Cherokee. And like to me that was, I never thought of a car, or a watch, or clothes as a proxy of validation. For me, it wasn't envy or need. I see so many people motivated by, they had it hard, and they saw money as the way out, and it was a chip on their shoulder. I don't have a chip on my shoulder. I have a curiosity in my stomach. I am so curious to how good am I at this skill? How do I play the game? Have you like chess, like boxing? I like the craft. You need to have great customer service to build any business. So talk to us about this crazy story about this woman who wanted a case of Beringer White Zinfandel in the two and a half hour snow. This was, this is such a, so anybody who owns a business, if you're listening right now, and you wanna make a point, a culture, do something in action. Don't make a fucking poster and put it in the hallway. Don't tell a story that happened in the past. You and I have enough horror stories where we can tell the kids, do an action. So I was building this store. We're now on fire at this point. This is later. This is like 2002 or three. We built a new store. I grew up in a smaller store than we built a big store as I was growing the revenue. I am the man on the floor, and this is the holidays. When I tell you, from 18 to 34 years old, my December, and I mean all the first 24 days of December, outside of when I was in college, so, but even then I came home way early because I was barely going to class. I would spend from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the floor of my dad's liquor store. That was prime time, especially pre-internet, you know? We are in the midst of one of the busiest days in the history of the store. And now we're doing internet business, and we get a phone call in the order department. I'm running upstairs, downstairs. I'm keeping an eye on the internet and the store, and I'm fuckin' a maniac. And we get this call from the son of this elderly woman. Wasn't even her. That her case got mischipped, and this was like December 23rd or 2nd or 1st. I don't remember, but put it this way. She lived in Jersey, and that's one day delivery, and I knew that if we put it back in the mail, she wouldn't have gotten it for Christmas. And he made a big to-do that she needed it for Christmas. I remember to stay like yesterday. I knew that there would be a day that I wasn't gonna be at that store. I knew that I was gonna have to build my own life at some point, because I knew my dad viewed it like an immigrant, which is, oh, this is your business, but it's really not. I can't buy a home, because I have no equity. Like I couldn't, you know, I would inherit it when he would pass, well, I'm fuckin' gonna be 50 and 15 months, and my dad's still working every day, so you can imagine I was smart enough, thank God, at 22, to be like, I gotta do my own thing. But I remember I needed to do things, because once I was gone, I wanted them to know how it was built. I knew then. So even though I'm on the floor and generating 10 to $20,000 an hour just me personally, on someone like you that had high net worth, that would come in and be like, I need three cases of high end wine for the holidays. I was that guy. I decide to make a huge to-do about this case of Beringer-White-Sinfandel. It's snowing, like the weather's bad, and I decide to grab a case from the basement, and I tell my inner team, just like this, in a circle, I'm like, I'm gonna go deliver this, because we have the best customer service in the game. And they are stunned. I never, I don't go to pee for 15 hours during the day, that's how busy it is, and how committed I am, and now I'm gonna drive to Bergen County, isn't that an hour, and that's without snow? The fuck are you doing, Gary? And I said, I just remembered that this was my moment to make a point. So I did it, I drove, I enjoyed it, I listened to sports radio on the way, got back, everybody was stunned, everybody was sweating, Brandon was like, you missed Mr. Thompson and Mr. Smith, and all this money was lost, but it became a story. To this day, that story is being told to employees in our store about customer service. I might have lost $20,000 in sales that hour, but I've helped my dad make millions since, and I think more companies should understand that actions carry enormous weight. And I believe that every leader that's listening right now should think about what they care about most and instilling in their company, and then should go out of their way for the most hyperbolized executions of those things so that it becomes lore. I mean, look at this, I literally did that action, and here I am 20 plus years later, having the luxury to tell that story on an important platform like this, think about that. This is the meta of the thesis. It's how you're building. It's how you fucking, how do you think everything built? It's, everything's based on stories. Why do you think religion exists? Let's start at the beginning, and I wanna start with your dad, we'll talk about your mom separately. He moved, he was born in Barbarisq, USSR. He moved to the United States when he was three years old, didn't speak English, had no money. Talk to us about Arlene Newman and Bob Siegelman and the big breaks that people can have when they move to the United States and how they influence this future. I, right off the bat, adore you because, you know, I've been very fortunate over the last decade, I've been interviewed a lot, a lot, a lot. The fact that you get to go to Bob Siegelman and Arlene means real homework has been done for that, that means a lot to me. And it's really nice to actually have a platform to give them some love, because my father was very inspired in 1971, four years before I was born, when Jack Siegelman, their parents, the father of Arlene and Bob, came back to America. Jack left the Soviet Union, Jack left the Soviet Union in the 20s, I believe, when you could still kinda get out right after the revolution. And Jack was my dad's grandmother's brother. And he was the only one that went to America. And he had the brains and the family in a lot of ways. He saw it, he saw what was coming. He came, Jack is a much older man, came back to Russian in 1971, and my dad was really taken aback by a statement when he just looked at my dad, who was 16 or so at the time, 18 at the time, and just said, you need to get to America. And it's stuck for my father. There was an incident that happened in the Soviet Union that became world focused on Walter Cronkite, big thing. And there was this deal made between Israel, Spain, and America with the Soviet Union to get some Jews out of the Soviet Union. Only a couple hundred thousand were able to leave in the late 70s. I was lucky enough to be a part of that. The way you would do that is, there was an organization called HIAS that deserves a lot of credit. And you'd go to Austria, then Italy, then you would go anywhere. Many went to America, some went to Australia, some went to Germany. While we were in Italy, we got a letter in the mail that Jack passed away. This was the person that was gonna kind of look out for us when we came to America with nothing. When we get to America, it would have been very easy for Jack's kids who were in their 50s at this time, very well off, because Jack did very well for himself coming to America and did the American dream in the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s. You mean like construction business? Construction business, predominantly. It would have been very easy for them to look the other way of their lost, lost relatives from the Soviet Union. But Arlene especially was incredibly gracious to my father, got him his first car. And one of the things that Jack owned in his real estate empire was a small liquor store in Clark. So the organization that got us to America kind of put us up as refugees in a studio apartment in Queens. And my dad did a bunch of side jobs the first six months, but the break of him being a stock boy in that liquor store that Jack once sold that now Bob was really running, he was the son, older son, so he was kind of like the main guy, but Arlene was a very feisty, prominent sister. And so they really co-owned that empire or whatever they inherited from Jack and they were doing their own separate things. And that is where my father's American dream was hatched from two bucks an hour being a stock boy to eventually being the manager of that store to eventually saving up money and buying a piece of that store from Bob. All in five years. Which is remarkable if you think about it. And so, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, a lot of times people are like, Gary, you would have never been here if it wasn't for your dad. I'm like, true, but my dad would have never, if that's true, then my dad would have never been here if it wasn't for Arlene and Bob. And if that was true, then Arlene and Bob would have never been in that position without Jack. And if that was true, and so, you know, I think we all as human beings, you know, self-made is a very funny thing because it's unbelievably true, but it's also very contextual. It's like lucky. Lucky is very weaponized by those who do not want to do. But even though luck is very much timing, serendipity, is very much part of anyone's story that builds something, it is clearly just one small ingredient of the outcome. And so Bob and Arlene were incredibly important to my parents and helped in many different ways. My name is Ginazi. That's my actual name. Arlene literally named me by telling my parents, name that him Gary. And so, you know, I think very prominent Bob unfortunately passed away many years ago when I was just starting my career at my dad's liquor store in my 20s. And Arlene is still kicking, and I hope her family shares this clip with her. So let's talk about your mom Tamara, who also came from the Soviet Union, came here at no money, didn't speak English, had a tough life in the Soviet Union. Very. Dad died at five years old? Mom died at five. And then dad went to prison for 10 years for being Jewish and went to the Gulag in Siberia. So talk to her about the influence that your mom had on you. You know, I would argue that my mom, you know, my parents are very influential in my life, like for many, but very for me. And I would say my mom is probably the person that probably is the one who gives me the most fuel to tell everybody on the other side of these podcasts that you can do it. Please don't complain about silly things. Choose optimism, because when I think about my mom's life, it's remarkable to think about the energy that she brings to the world. Much like I, in a lot of ways, am the emotional rock of so many people around me, my mom was that for everyone. When I think about how little that rock was watered, you know, it just, it was in her. It was her DNA. She is the strongest person I know. She's just incredibly strong. And she made me very strong. And you know, obviously just even already hearing how this interview is gonna go, I'm sure you've seen how much I speak about her and how I revere her. And I admire her to the depths of my soul. And she was a perfect mother. She did plenty of things wrong, but everything that I hold near and dear, everything that I know is a core ingredient to why I'm successful, it's very easy for me to point to both of my parents, but my mother had the luxury because my father, you know, something I admire about my father, we had so little, but my father was hell bent on allowing my mother to stay home and mother. And so through his 15, 18 hours a day of work ethic and with her talents in our household, you know, when I talk about anytime I'm brought up, even that intro, when I hear six time this or great this or the accolades run right through me and it points towards them and that makes me happy. Did they ever say the four words that I think are the most important four words in English language I believe in you? 100%. They said those words out loud? My mother, who was much more of a communicator in my life, not only did she say that, it was a constant currency in my life. Like I would speculate if I can recall properly, there was probably not a day in my life between five and 15 where my mother didn't give me some sort of version of that. And not like checking the box. Like it was her natural communication and point of view on early on in my life, I remember just how often she said I had a golden heart. So anything I did that was nice for another person or for a relative or for my sister, it was always reinforced with your golden heart, your special, your a star. There was never a day where I didn't feel I was capable. And let's talk about in the second grade, you grew up without Monty and then she stayed up till midnight one night. Yeah, I mean, this is a very emotional story for me. It's why it's pinned as my main Instagram post on my account. So, I moved to Addison, New Jersey, which is amazing because it's, was an incredible place to grow up in the 80s. And you know, how old are you? 55. So this is perfect. We grew up in New Jersey. One of my best friends is from there. From New Jersey or from Addison? Yeah, Addison. No way. Yeah, Peter Warman, shout out to Peter. Peter, we need to hang. So, Peter will confirm this, where did you grow up? Detroit. Right, and so did you play outside a lot? Play outside a lot. So we, like you know this, and I'm sure you think of this as a parent, I sure do. As much as my mom and dad raised me, Addison, New Jersey raised me. I mean, I've been sitting in a lot lately because I just can't get out of my mind. For the kids that are listening, there used to be a commercial at 10 p.m. when we were growing up. That would air on network television that would say, it's 10 p.m. Do you know where your kids are? Because our parents literally didn't know. Like we were outside all the time. And like, you might forget to know if they even came home for dinner. So I was raised by Addison, New Jersey, and by my friends around me. And my friends loved football. Literally before we started this show, we were talking about football. Because I ran into Eric Godfrey and Robbie Turnick and Bobby Duffy and these kids that were playing football. And I became a huge Jets fan. And my friend Eric Godfrey had a number 24 green T-shirt. And again, this was a lower income town in New Jersey. So it wasn't like a authentic custom made jersey. It was just a T-shirt with the number 24 on it. Didn't even have Freeman McNeil's name on the back. But it was just a T-shirt with the number 24. And another kid, I don't remember his name. He had an 85 and that was Wesley Walker. And so now we're playing football all the time. And I wanted a Jets T-shirt too, a jersey. We couldn't afford that. And my mom made it very clear. She's like, we're not buying one. $30 at the time. Right, and probably 10 with inflation. You know, you could probably get one and came out for 10 bucks or Bradley's. But we just did not. Like the only clothes we had as kids was the liquor T-shirts my dad would get as promotions from the store. Like literally, I did not buy a T-shirt until I was in college. Because every T-shirt we had was a liquor promo T-shirt. There were eight of you in the studio apartment. Yes, my core family was two. It was those cousins, my grandma, they lived elsewhere. We eventually moved to Addis. It was just me and my mom, my brother and my sister and my brother came later in 87. But like the bottom line was the only money, the only thing that money was used for until I was 12 was food and shelter. The occasional toy was a monster thing. If me and my sister were to get a toy, a toy. I remember my brother was gonna be born in January of 87. I wish, like I'm laughing right now cause I know my sister's about to hear this line and she's just laughing. Hanukkah 86 was monstrous. My mom was overcompensating for the fact that we were about to have another child. And I got three wrestling figures and the wrestling ring. And I thought it was like, you would have thought I got a Rolls Royce and caviar for life. Like it was just absurd. So back then money was just for food and shelter and savings. It was all about saving money. We just talk about something that no one talks about anymore. Saving money was the currency back then, as you know. Probably as a child. It was in the ether, now it's not. Anyway, there was no thought of getting a jersey. And I was disappointed as any seven year old would be. And my mom would stay up to midnight for a week or two or I don't know how long it took her, but she knitted me a Jets jersey and put my favorite number at that time was five, still is. And I still have that jersey. It's got a number five. It's got my name Gary on the back. And it is my prized possession. And the reason when I take photos now, I put up the number five is it's just a little head nod to my mom who is my hero. I think a lot of us have experiences as a kid that help shape our future. We all do. I was bullied, I started to talk to us about Dover and some kid making a Pepsi cup and then making you drink pee. I've never heard of such a thing. I can't believe you brought this up. I know I've only brought that up in one or two interviews, which again, I'm giving heavy accolades to anybody involved in the research team for this interview or you yourself, very impressive. But what's even crazier about this is I literally thought about this either today or yesterday or the day before. In the last 72 hours, I thought about this. I don't even know why. I do know why, because it probably meant that I knew this question was coming. That's a whole other story for another day. But it's really fascinating you just brought that up. I remember it very well. I was in Dover. I cannot even recall what the kids look like, but I remember one was tall. I actually think I'm starting to remember. I think one of the kids' name was Elliot. He was the alpha kid. There was four or five kids. I was fucking five, maybe six. And again, my mother grew up in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, everyone's scared of the government. So there was no kidnapping. There was no crime. People were just scared. What did that mean? Means kids were outside playing by themselves as early as four by themselves. I remember my mom telling me to take care of my sister. When we moved to Edison, we played outside. We moved in September, August of 82. My sister was born in July. My sister was three and played outside with me without my mom anywhere near. Like that's just how it was. So anyway, obviously if that's how it was, that's how it was for me. We moved to Dover. I'm five. I'm outside. You're just fucking outside. You just literally, again, you may know this. You're just trying to find kids that are doing shit. I found these kids. They were not good kids. And yeah, I remember it vividly. Like I remember it's hazy, but it's vivid. Kid runs off to the side, pees in the Pepsi can. I'm very sharp. I have common sense. I'm not very, like I'm very, I have a lot of common sense that I'm sharp. That's his core strength of mine. I have good instincts. I know when dangers is around. Like I come from like, not like the streets, but like I'm a Jersey kid. Like I'm not getting tricked. Like my wallet's not getting stolen. Like shit like that. So I knew something was, like I knew what was, that's what I most remember about it. I knew that it wasn't Pepsi. But they were able to force me to take a sip, you know? And it's not fun to drink another key pee, you know? Did you go home and tell your mom? Yeah, I'm sure. But like, you know, like the truth is like, I don't, you know, I remember like not drinking it. Like, you know, putting the lips, you spit it out. I remember, I, you know, it's so crazy. And this was foundational for me. Bullying has never penetrated me. Meaning even then, it's funny where my brain's going. It wasn't fun, right? It wasn't like I enjoyed it. But I don't think of it as like this iconic event. I think of it as a good story that paints a picture of like not everything is rosy. But I can give you a lot of those events. Like when I think, I had twins move in, big guys. They were Andrew and Gregory. They were in fifth grade when I was in second grade. And Edison, they were tough kids. They were the biggest kids in fifth grade. I was the smallest kid in second grade. And we played football every day and did make pretend WWF wrestling. I was getting my ass kicked every day. And they were like bullying, definitely by bully standards. I view them fondly as my friends. I just think there was a lot of adversity. I'm sure, I mean, I cried all the time until I was 12. I'm very emotional. Like even you getting emotional is like starting to trigger me. Like I'm like, I can cry. I cried every day, I mean almost. My mom said, don't worry. You'll be more successful in all these kids one day. And it did, I had a chip on my shoulder big time. Yeah, and to me, I'm competitive. Like I want to win. And maybe the chip is so deep that it doesn't even look. For me, it's just so healthy. I'm just always so happy. Like I want to win, but I don't want you to lose. Does that make sense? Like when I compete, I don't think I'm taking something from someone. I love capitalism in its most purest form because it's just who's better. And then like, let's all go home. It's not a winner take all. It's very abundant. Anyway, back to the Pepsi story. Yeah, but like my mom, again, I mean, you have parents in 2025 going to like yell at teachers for a C. That wouldn't even register it on my mom's radar. If I came home and said, mom, these boys made me drink pee should have been like, okay, or my dad. Like this is what my dad would show up once in a while. I remember one time we were playing baseball when I was more like 11 and Edison and the guy in the corner like yelled at me and my friends. And like it was really not like nice. It was definitely like overly aggressive. And like I told my mom, my mom told my dad and my dad like rang the doorbell and said, don't do that to my son again. Like I was like, oh my God, my dad showed up out of nowhere to like be a hero. I like that. But yeah, my parents didn't like, it was the fucking 80s. You didn't get involved in like too much shit. Now everything's so fucking sensitive. Back then it was just like, you know, like she would comfort me and then she would tell me to wipe it off. And it was easy for me to wipe it off. So at some point you got into baseball cards. We'll talk in a little detail about that. Talk to us about when you were at John Adams Middle School and the first card show you had on Oak Tree Lane at the Jewish Community Center. Yeah, the sixth grade baseball card collecting club was transformational up until that point. There was a kid by the name of Eric Conrad that used to come. I didn't know about divorced parents back then. And I didn't even register me, but I was always like curious. I'm like, why is this guy only here in the summer? You know, like, because when I was in second grade, I was young, but he was the first one that introduced me to baseball cards. He wasn't even actually a baseball card collector. He liked building card houses. You know, like taking playing cards and building. Yeah, we did those. Yeah, you did those. So I would go over his house in the summer, we met him. He stayed inside more than we did. He was like less active outside, but he would stay inside and he would make card houses. I thought that was cool. And so I'd come over once a week or once every two weeks and build a card house with him. I was into sports. I loved the Yankees at that point. I mean, I remember it like yesterday, we're in his basement. He brings out his cards, but this time there's baseball cards too to make the card houses. And I was like, what is this? And I was like, game changing. So cool. And then I remember he said we could get them at Crousers. Crousers was like a 7-Eleven in New Jersey. I promise your friend knows what it is. It was also an Oak Tree Road. We walked or took our bikes to Crousers and there they were, baseball cards. And I started buying them. And I just, that was fine. And then again, another great New Jersey Edison story. There was a flea market on US 1, Route 1, the US 1 flea market. And me, my parent, my mom and my uncle, and they went there to like pick up some groceries or something, just check it out. And there was a guy who had a baseball card booth, caught my attention and he had a price guide. And I begged my uncle, Misha, to buy it for me. Or my mom, one of them did. And now I came home and had a price guide. It was before Beckett, which is the big price guide. And it was CDM, I think, or something like that. Anyway, that was the first time I knew they were worth money. And I ran up to my room and looked up every baseball card I had. And like some were worth like 30, and by the way, a card that I had being worth 35 cents was like striking fucking gold in Texas. I thought that was insane. And that started me getting really interested in fifth grade and then sixth grade came and the title wave came. There was a baseball card collecting club. This was now 1986 when the whole card thing really started happening the first time in America. And that was the first big card boom. And I was in it. I was in it, affected by it. And then I did a card show at the JCC on Oak Tree Road. And I had the bug. I had the bug. And then the big one, the big first, that was like a half ass card show. Like my friend really had the table I kind of stopped by. My first card show was at really me driving it was at the Phillipsburg Mall once I moved in eighth grade. That was sixth grade where I tasted it. But by eighth grade when I moved to Edison, excuse me, to Hunterdon County, I did my own card show and crushed. I remember being petrified because the table's like 150 bucks or something like that. 280. Thank you. And it was a lot of money. It was, and my dad said it'll be good experience. Everybody in the family thought I was gonna lose. And we made. I mean, I had a great first day and made all my money back the first day. And I would argue from that moment on, I've never looked back. I would say Phillipsburg Mall, 1989 card show. When I made that money that weekend, when I was good, when I could tell that I was better than the grown men around me at selling cards, that was it. I've never really looked back. There's another show at Phillipsburg Mall that you were prepping for at six a.m. And you're all ready to go and your dad said you're not going. So what happened that day? And how did that moment change your life? That one's, boy, that hurt. By the way, that just hurt again. Yeah, I was super getting ready, bought a table. And my dad's like, you're out. And I'm like, what do you mean? And he goes, you have to work now. So I was getting really bad grades at that point in my life, like Ds and Fs, not even Cs. And my parents were pretty real about it. My mom grounded me all the time for progress reports and report cards. And my parents were like, look, if you're not gonna be a scholar, you're gonna be a worker. And so you have to start working in the store. And I did. And I went from making thousands of dollars a weekend at baseball cards stores to making two bucks an hour because that's when my dad got paid. I remember vividly that minimum wage was 505 in New Jersey at this point. And I was getting two bucks an hour and it was devastating. I was, I hated it at first. And I had a bag ice in my dad's basement. You know, a year later I was stocking shelves. And the first year was very challenging for me. It was always a chore. I never wanted to do it. My mom was a ray of sunshine. My dad was very quiet, introverted, very negative. So it was a new environment of adversity for me too. And it really sucked until I realized that people collected wine and I was able to make that connection. And that transformed it when I was 15 a year in. I realized that it changed kind of the way I would talk to my dad about it and really got it going. When you were 14, your dad had a serious conversation with you. On the way there? He thought you were full of shit. And you had a very come to Jesus would be the wrong word because we're Jewish, but. Yeah. And you know what's funny? It was, I speak of it as my dad really put me on the straight and arrow because I had salesmanship, gift of gab, like whatever it was to make a sale when I was 12. It was less than he thought it was full of shit. It was that he didn't like that I embellished the amount of cases we sold one day. So pretty early on when I about a year in the first year was terrible basement the whole time, bagging ice, maybe making a occasional appearance upstairs, just to pack something out. But the second year I got to be upstairs and that really was good. Cause then I was in the action. I was in the traffic. Customers would walk in. I was in the game. What I liked. It's why I liked flea markets. It's why I like baseball card stores. So pretty quickly, I would say within two or three weekends, my dad was, this is when my, I wish I really talked to my mom and dad about this. I'm going to speak to them about this. My mom definitely gassed me up to my dad when I was coming in and she's like, he's got it. He didn't know. And he's skeptical. He's like, we'll see. Very quickly once I was upstairs at 15, I think my dad realized he's got it. And so he started to really, that's when it got fun. He's like, Hey, we got a lot of cases of this wine. Sell it. I'm fucking 15. I look 11 and I'm slinging wine effectively. And so it was really neat. And I just remembered this one weekend. I don't remember if it was Iron Horse Chardonnay or Kenwood Chardonnay, some of the most prominent Pardew Cheapetites for us. One of the things that I remember early on in my career that he wanted to sell. And he's like, how'd we do, you know, on the way home? And I was like crushed. I sold like 25 cases or whatever. And the real number was like 17. And the next day my dad came home because he didn't have the date in front of him. And he really made it to do of like, if you fucking sell 17 cases, you say 17, not 25. And that was kind of like the way he was addressing like, word is bond, like straight, like my dad's to this day. If you embellished to my dad, you've done a catastrophic lie. He's very rigid when it comes to lying, embellishing. And so I think that was very healthy for me because I'd such natural gab at that point. And if I had a different, like I see it in people. I see people who have natural salesmanship, grow up in a family full of hucksters and they end up selling, you know this, what I'm about to say, selling bullshit and selling real shit is the same shit. Some kids just go down the wrong path. And I don't think I was gonna go down the wrong path. I wasn't gonna be that, but I'm very grateful that he tweaked and tightened me because I think it's made me more respectful. You mentioned school and you were a D and F student. You weren't really studying that hard. You made a point to be a wine expert at 16, reading wine spectator and science class. Every parent also thought you're gonna be a loser. And how did that feel and did that motivate you? Yeah, that motivated me. Back to chips on shoulders. Again, and it's fun to dissect it in this kind of environment. I think there's healthy chips on shoulders and not healthy. I always say there's two ways to build the biggest building in town. Just build the biggest building or spend your time tearing everyone's buildings down. You know, it's funny, even as I'm trying to go in this direction in the conversation, I don't think it's fully true. Meaning I don't remember saying to myself that Steve Nash's mom, lovely lady, like I could see she was disappointed when she would ask me about how I was doing in school, but it didn't leave me saying like, I'm gonna fucking show. You know what I mean? Like I never, nobody was atrocious to me. Teachers, I remember Mrs. Stats, my sophomore and senior year math teacher, really be disappointed in her reaction and maybe a little rassy when I was a senior. But yeah, I mean, you know this, were you a good student? That was my ticket out. So I graduated top one, I'm pretending my class at Michigan. You know this, we all knew that that, we didn't even know that entrepreneurship was a ticket out when you and I were growing up. It wasn't in the ether, not for me at least. What's for you? Fresh and near at Michigan. We'll talk about Jeff Blau and the related companies in a minute. Love that, so maybe that, you know again because you went to a strong university and you got exposed to more stuff. I can tell you for me, it was, we were all propagandaed and brainwashed in junior high and high school that your college, where you go to college is the unilateral black and white undisputed proxy and indicator to being successful. If you went to Harvard, you were gonna be successful. And if you went to community college, you were a fucking loser. And that's how the world was that I was living in. And so it was a huge currency and I was adamantly debating it in my own head. I was completely convinced that I was going to be fiscally successful and emotionally successful. And I do believe that that's because of what my mom was saying internally at home and what was happening to me in the market. The merit of the market was speaking to me. I was making more money at card shows than grown men that were doing it full time for their profession. And that gave me huge confidence. So you end up going to Mount Ida College, which for everybody who's watching this podcast knows, this is favorite college. And your freshman year, you were playing Madden and then what happened? Then Pete from Maine said, you gotta come and see this. And I go into a dorm room and there's a computer and I hear for the first time, koo koo, shh, I'm like, is that internet thing? Informational super highway, world wide web. You guys are gonna be blown away by this. Literally, it was so crazy. We would sit there and watch people surf the web. Like, watch them. Like I stood there for two fucking hours before I got to get on the keyboard, watching Pete from Maine and others get on the computer and do different things. And even then what was super interesting was everyone was scared to leave AOL. You just stayed in AOL. Like there was this browser, I remember, it would just be like the world wide web. We're like, we're not gonna click that. That's like, that's too crazy. You may get caught up. And yeah, I finally got on it late because it was like college life, right? If I recall, I didn't even get into that dorm room until like 10 p.m. I got finally on the computer at like 12, one o'clock in the morning. And I typed in, I typed the two things that I knew, baseball cards and wine. And I mean, out of a fucking movie, it was right then, literally if I was ever lucky enough to have a movie made of me, the scene would be accurate. It was that dramatic. I literally remember seeing the reflection of my own face in the monitor saying, this is it. I just knew. And what I knew quickly after that was that Amazon and eBay were the game pretty fast. You know, like pretty fast. Cause it might've been second semester freshman year. It might've been 95 already. Or maybe I'm blurring it and maybe it was a year later. Within the first year of my journey, I just knew that this was gonna be it and I wanted to be as great at it as possible. And I just studied it and would go to CompUSA. Remember that retailer? And buy a magazine and read about it. So what I was doing with wine, I started doing with the internet. And I remember just really being fascinated by it. And the only obsession I had was, I'm gonna take my dad's liquor store online. Cause at that point I was already pro committed that I was gonna go to the family business. And I was very focused. And this only deeply immigrant kids, I think will understand me right now. This is hard I think for an American kid to understand. Based on American culture, it's not good or bad. But I was obsessed. That would be the word I would use. I think there's a lot of American kids who are excited to help their family business. As long as it helps them. I think immigrant kids will understand this. I was obsessed with building up the family business for my parents. And even today, even as I say that, I'm like almost like, was I brainwashed? Is am I that noble? Did my parents do such a good job? And I had such a good understanding that I would still get mine later. I don't know, but I think it was very unusual. I remember people thinking it was unusual. I don't know if I was addicted to the nobleness of it. But at that point in my life, before I saw the internet, like junior year of high school, two years earlier, three years earlier, I was like, I'm gonna go and fucking crush for my parents because I can. And so all I was obsessed with is, this is how I'm gonna crush for my, because originally I thought I was gonna open 100 stores. I always thought I was gonna build the Toys R Us of Wine Library of Wine. My framework was comp USA and Staples and McDonald's and Toys R Us and Walmart. There was no Amazon and eBay to look to. But that was the night I decided I was gonna build it through that and I did that. You took a company from $3 million to $60 million and a short amount of time, you saw things that people didn't see at the time. You bought keywords, ad words, wine was five cents, and then after nine months went to 10 cents. So what did you see that nobody else saw as really a first mover advantage with anything? It's so important sometimes in building businesses. It's what I see right now with live shopping on social. I'm gonna assume that, I'm gonna just look around the room, people here know that TikTok shop exists, that people sell things on TikTok. I'm gonna assume that people here know that, or this might be small, but you might know what what not is live shopping. I'm gonna assume that people in this circle know that China's been selling stuff on live social for the last seven years at scale. I'm gonna assume that people are listening and watching, might have saw the viral video of that woman with the handbags who does $8 million just by doing this. I know that all to be true. I also know that almost every single person in this circle right now is underestimating it. I know that 99.9% of the people who are watching this right now don't understand it the way I do. I understand it for what it is, which is it's going to be massive, massive. That if you ask me right now of all the optionality in the world, of how to make money in the next five years, in America, that live shopping is at the tippy top of my list. That's what I saw with websites email and Google AdWords. I don't think I was the only person that saw it. I just think what I'm very good at is I view these trends like poker. And I view live shopping on whatnot and Fanatics Live and TikTok Shop and Meadow will have to do it because it's gonna get too big. I view it like having the nuts in poker. I feel like I've got the best, like I know it's the best hand. And so if you know you have the best hand, educate me, you're poker players, you go all in because you've won. Sure they may fold, but you go all in. I know that. That's what I do for a living. What I'm good at is knowing what humans are gonna do. And I know when it's the biggest hand, the best hand. And so the reason I was able to build my daddy's liquor store was having a website was better than having a catalog. Right? I wanted to compete with Sherry Lehmann's, Zachy's, Morel's, Sam's Wine Club in Chicago, K&L in California. I wanted to have the specs in Texas. I wanted to have the best wine store in the country. What were those stores doing when I was in high school and college? They were buying full page ads in a Wall Street Journal and the New York Times Wednesday dining in section and they were sending catalogs in the mail. I outflanked them by having a website and having an email newsletter. So my email newsletter in 1998 when 94 Dominus came out and Insignia, I would email everybody and they would buy for me. They would get the catalog from Sherry Lehmann's four weeks later, because catalogs are slow. Email is fast. Catalogs are expensive. To make and ship, email is free. So even though I had no money, I outsmarted them by knowing where the attention was because Wall Street had moved to email, but not everybody caught up. I believe social media is now in my brain. 20% of all social media content is live shopping. It's not yet, but it will be. And so I'm gonna move fast during this era on it. That's what I did with email, with having a website at all. And then finally, the big final atomic bomb outflanking everybody on Google AdWords. Let's move to December 2008 and you have a meeting at ESPN. Your brother age is graduating BU. And you walk out of there with a couple of things. What did you walk out with and then what happened next? Well, I first walked out with $5,000 that I couldn't comprehend. You gotta remember at this point, I'm still making less than $100,000 a year. Even though I'm 33 years old and built this huge business, immigrant life. Again, if you don't live in an immigrant business, you don't understand, but like I built this huge business, created hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue over that course of period of time. And I'm still making very little. My dad's making super little too, but he owns the business. So I'm starting to think about my next chapter. My brother's about to graduate and we're bouncing a lot of ideas. Daily fantasy sports, which probably would have done well. Something that looked like Groupon and Living Social. That probably would have done well. Something that looked like Buzzfeed. That probably would have done well. But those would have all taken time to build. And I really didn't have any money. And AJ surely didn't. And cause I just invested in Facebook and Twitter. So all my liquid was gone. And so consulting, getting paid for action was a better cash flow option. And it's amazing. And I get this random email cause at this point I'd mess a lot of followers on Twitter, but it's still early. It's still the first couple of years of Twitter. And ESPN asks if I could come in and consult on how to grow their social, their Twitter specifically. What year was this? 2008. Steve Bornstein was CEO or he had left? It wasn't at that level. It was way lower down. It was three to four levels below that. Maybe five, if I'm thinking properly of their org at the time. It was marketing, but it wasn't even like, it was definitely not the CMO, let alone the CEO. And I don't even think it was the number two in marketing. It was a lower level, but the guy had the ability to write a $5,000 check. Which is nothing for a corporation. So it was lower level. Anyway, I go in, I sit in a room like this, I consult for a couple of hours, I enjoy it to no end. And I leave and literally it's like old school. Like you gotta check back then. And I call my brother as soon as I'm in midtown cause it was in midtown or something like that. I call my brother, I said I got it. We're gonna start a consultancy. I didn't even call out an agency yet. Wasn't really even an agency. But I couldn't believe that it was 2008 going into 09. And I couldn't believe the biggest companies in the world didn't understand social media cause I've been pod committed since 06. And that's probably one of the first times I've learned about timing. I'm just talking about it right now with live shopping. I'll say it again, I don't think I'm a, Andreessen Horowitz invested in whatnot a long time ago. I'm not a genius. I just feel like in this nanosecond that everybody's underestimating how big it's gonna be. And I didn't understand that. I didn't understand that it would take that long for people to get it. And as it got bigger, it got slower, right? I didn't know that. Entrepreneurial and information and action goes faster than it does in corporate land. And so I was like, wait, there's an opportunity. They still don't get it. And so that's why I decided to start VaynerMedia. Which is also blown up. Yeah, VaynerMedia started in the conference room of Buddy Media. With your friend, Mike Lazaro. Yes. And you got equity for building a website. I got equity for giving a quote, not even building a new website. Which they sold the company's sales first for a billion dollars. Yeah. That was a good outcome for a quote. For me, I did extremely well. I literally made seven figures to give a quote. Cause at that point I'd written a book called Crush It. That was the first time I'd hit the scene outside of the wine world. And very quickly after that, I was starting to be viewed as an angel investor with the Super Angels, Tim Ferriss and Dave Morn and Chris Sock and Kevin Rose and Travis Calke. And I was definitely in the game, Calcana. So I was in the game in that era, 2006 to 2012. It was a very good era for my personal brand with books and speeches and investing. And VaynerMedia is something I'm very proud of. We literally started it in a conference room and it's a $350 million a year revenue business now with 2,000 plus employees. And we're definitely the most progressive contemporary agency in the world. And it's also been the foundation of my other behaviors. I started Rezi inside of there with Ben Leventhal. 2014. I started Empathy Wines, which I sold to Constellation with Nate and John, two former interns in that company. 2019. And then V Friends, which I believe, and it's fun to put this on video, to look back on in 20 or 30 years now, but I'm in the midst right now of building an intellectual property. I'm very affected and inspired by Pokemon being worth $100 billion. I do not think people realize how big that company is. I also am very inspired by Jim Henson, a real creative force who really wanted to leave a deposit of good on the world. Fraggle Rock, Sesame Street, Muppets. And so, yeah, I'm building V Friends. And a lot of the talent that works inside of V Friends came from Vayner. So Vayner has been an incredible company, but it's also been an incredible incubator of talent and osmosis of like how I wanna do things. And I'm very excited about it. So I'll tell you back in my life. In 1999, I'm on my honeymoon with my first wife in Hawaii at Huala Life. I don't know if you've been there or not. Oh, actually I have. I spoke to Brian Jordan there. And this guy next to me is reading a magazine that no longer exists, The Industry Standard. And I said, hey, are you in the business? He said, yeah, I said, what's your name? I said, my name's Ron Conway. And so, talk to us about Ron and the influence he had in your life. And then let's go back. Google was started in 2005. It sold one year, nine months, and 28 days later for $1.45 billion. And you read something about that. And then as part of the story, it tells about how making bad decisions on emotions is a terrible strategy. And you can talk about playing cook from Twitter and how you got that deal. And then talk about Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, for dinner, and then his parents. You got it. So that whole Silicon Valley era for me started with, so now I'm right about email. I'm right about the website. I'm right about Google AdWords in 05, and here comes YouTube. And I see that, and I'm like, fuck, I'm gonna build my dad's story with this. So I've used the tool of web. I've used the tool of search and email. And here comes video online. And I start using the tool. Why Not Me TV on February 21st, 2006, less than a year after YouTube comes out. And I wanna take a moment right now and give a huge shout out to Eric Castner. Eric Castner was my lead developer. One of the most progressive things I've done in my life was the day I started working in my dad's store full time, May of 98. I told him from the day I started, I will take nothing in my salary, but we need to hire a computer guy. That's what I call developers back then. We need to hire a computer guy. And by 2000 or 2001, I was able to finally get to a place where I was able to hire Eric Castner, and then later John Casamanis, who's still our CTO. And we had, we're a fucking liquor store in New Jersey, and I have literal developers full time on my staff. It was so progressive. It'd be like if I hired astronauts right now. Like it just made no sense. Anyway, I wanna give a shout out to Eric Castner because without Eric Castner, a lot of this does not happen. He was the one that sat closer than you and I are sitting right now at my desk, and was like, read TechCrunch, read Metafilter, read White Reb, read, you know, Dink. He was the one that showed me Web 2.0. And during that journey, he showed me YouTube because I asked him two years earlier if I could do videos on the site, and he said no, too expensive to host. Now we found this, they were hosting it. So now I'm doing YouTube, I explode. This is where my career really takes a turn. The wine show explodes, and then I'm now really starting to get into this tech stuff, and how do I use it to build a wine store? But it's still wine store, wine store, wine store. And then Google buys YouTube. And one point, you remember this. That number, I don't think the kids can, now everything's inflation. You remember that number? 1.45 billion. Do you remember how everyone reacted? It was insane. I'm saying it right now, because I want you guys to hear and be affected by it. It'd be as if you woke up tomorrow, and TikTok was forced to sell and sold for a trillion. It's like, you couldn't, we didn't see numbers like that. Everything was, big numbers were hundreds of millions. I mean, Flickr sold for 40 million to Yahoo, and that seemed like a drillian. Flickr was the precursor to Instagram. Anyway, I'm just like, holy shit. And now I'm a little bit older, and I'm reading more business magazines, not just wine, and I read a Wall Street Journal article about the sale, because I was fascinated. I felt different this time. I was like, fuck, man, I feel like my talents are not being maximized. I'm using these things to build my dad's business. There's gotta be a way. I just felt different. I was just reading everything about it. And in one article specifically, it references Ron Conway, and it says, angel investor, I've never heard the term in my life. Angel investor, Ron Conway, made a good trillion dollars. I don't remember how much he put in or what he got, but it was staggering. It was like, for his $100,000 investment, made $4 million, or I don't know, it might even be, it was just staggering. I don't remember the details. I just remember immediately going from print, because it was, I think, the journal, to computer and Googling, not Ron Conway, Googling the term angel investor. Googling it, ironically, very, very apropos. And I'm like, huh. And I literally, again, said to myself, I'm gonna be an angel investor. I'm gonna build up some savings. I had some savings at that point. And one of the first videos I ever made that wasn't a wine video, was called Facebook should be worried about Twitter. Because Twitter just come out, I was again fascinated by it. And I promised myself after the Ron Conway article that the next time I felt it, that I would invest. And the next time I felt it was Twitter. And that video went viral. Blaine Cook was the first CTO of Twitter. First developer. Developer, thank you. And I met him at South by because now I'm going to these conferences. And he, Twitter, I don't know if you, were you in the mix, you remember this? I was in the mix, but not, didn't mess in Twitter. I understood, but do you remember that Twitter would go down all the time? It was, yeah. It was down all the time. It was the hottest app in Silicon Valley, but it was down, down, did not work all the time. They did Ruby on Rails early on. It was complicated. He was getting so much heat. I met him for a taco at South by and he told me he was quitting and selling every share and did I want any. First, and I'm really proud of this, back to being a good person. First, I tried to talk him out of it. I said, I think you're making a huge mistake. Second, I could see he was making an emotional decision. And he just went the whole way and a couple of weeks later on emails, like, do you want to buy it? I'm done. I'm like, Blaine, he's like, I'm done. And so me, Fred Wilson and Kevin Rose, if I recall properly, bought up all his shares. That was my first investment. And then. And he left $700 million, a $2 billion on the table. That's right. Just staggering. And then several months later, because I become friendly with, my video went viral, Facebook, Dave Moran asked me to speak at Facebook. Zucks was there. We had dinner that night. We hit it off. We started to get to know each other and his sister, Randy, called me one night when I was in Miami at a speaking engagement, said, my parents, Mark wanted me to call our parents or look at us, sell some shares. They're gonna buy a nice home near us in California because they were still in Connecticut. Would you like to buy some Facebook equity? I said, absolutely. I'm just game chair. I literally took 80% of my savings in investment in Facebook. Congrats. Thank you. I've never sold a share. I promised myself that night that if as long as Mark was the CEO, I'd never sell. All right, so let's go a little quickly on some of these. You've invested in over a hundred companies. What do you look for when making an angel investment? Early on, I went for the horse. Then I went for the jockey. Now it requires both. The horse was the idea. Biggest mistake I made as an investor early on as a kid, a kid in my 30s, was I, if I liked the idea, I could see how I could run it to success. I didn't realize I was a good operator yet. Then I learned that that wasn't always working. Then it was about the kid. But even with the best operators, if you're operating a bad idea, that also won't work. So now what I look for in angel investing is the jockey and the horse, the operator and the idea. And so what's the best way to pitch you? I read what you're going to say. And what I would give is my answer is very different what you're gonna give is your answer. What's your answer? My answer would be to come and prepare it. And if you have to get in the door and you don't know me, you can create a ridiculous PowerPoint presentation that blows you off of your chair. And I'm good on the preparation. We'll talk about that in a few minutes. But I prepared materials for people that they have to respond, right? Because you know when you open this document, holy shit, did this take 40 hours to prepare or more? This thing's like a Rolls Royce. It's a Ferrari on steroids. And if someone's putting that much work into it, it shows the amount of thought, progress. It's brilliant. I've received a few of those sometimes. A lot of my deals, most of them 99% will come from people I know, right? And so it's a self-selecting process. But every now and then I get something ridiculous in the mail. We've never invested in a cold deal like that. But we've come very, very close. Interesting. Yeah, mine's the opposite. And this goes back to self-awareness. This goes back to like, you gotta know yourself. Like, I always say everything works. Everything works. Like, there's a version of success and happiness that comes in so many different sizes and shapes that it can work. For me, I don't even consume decks. My team knows this. Like, to really prepare for me, I need to have the dialogue. I need to have the feel. Like for me, at this point, to your point, so much comes from word of mouth, different angles. But what really gets me is if somebody says something that I believe in, that I can follow up with a couple of questions and they can answer it. For example, what cliche happens to me is I make a big stink on something like this about live shopping. Now I'm gonna get pitched. This is real. Like, you're saying, oh my God. I'm gonna get bombarded. Yeah. I won't look at most of those emails. I won't go for the Rolls Royce deck. I will go for the person that finds me somewhere and or I get a meeting through a person because I wanna, if somebody co-signs someone, I'll take that meeting. But it's not what they say to me. It's my follow-up question. I really tend to invest in things I know. More and more, by the way, as I get older. And so I know what I'm talking about with live shopping. So to me, I enjoy the back and forth because the other thing I think I do well is push. I push well in dialogue to like real places and most people can't answer those real places. You know this. A lot of founders are very good at the surface level conversation. But when you poke and prod, they fold like cheap chairs. What the craziest thing is, you ask someone about, they talk about run rate. Run rate doesn't apply to the cash in the bank. So I always ask, what are the gap revenues? You know how many CEOs know what their gap revenues are in the last three years, less than 1%. And for me, the meeting's over. Right? I mean, if you don't know your finance as well. And so for me, you're referring to things that are a little bit further along. I do so much early stage that to me, it's almost the reverse of, I love you for that. That like, that just, I wish people knew how nerdy I am with business. That just got me so fired up. But that's obviously a little bit of a later stage company and that's an area. For me, because I'm so intuitive of consumer behavior, I get excited about them having to answer pre-revenue since I do such early stage. Real questions about consumer behavior. And I'm so in the traffic. One of the reasons that Gary V Brand still lives and I run the agency is I never want to be away from the dirt. Yeah. Let's talk about your visa marketing and day trading attention. And we'll go back to Jab, Jab, Jab, your favorite number five. So talk about that book in particular and what you want to call it. And I know you want to call it something else. So what we did is we actually made you a new book. And here's your new book. It's actually Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab. So congratulations on your new book. I'll show it to everybody. That's awesome. It was supposed to be left hook by the way. Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab, left hook. So this book I wrote because I realized no one understood what was going on with content on the internet. By the time I wrote this 10 years ago, 2014, there wasn't a lot of science around the art of a post. I believe as we sit here today, my friend, that the best social media organic post, just post on your account, is a more important form of advertising than any television commercial on television today outside of Super Bowl. The individual post. You said the Super Bowl, which costs $233,000 per second, is the greatest marketing spend on TV. I didn't have to get that price. No, no, in America. In America. Here's why. My newest book, Day Trading Attention, I do believe that I sit at the top of the organization that is the best marketing firm in not wasting a penny on advertising and getting the most for a penny. And that requires a lot. I, Gary, and VaynerX, the holding company, cannot get 130 million Americans. Cannot get 130 million Americans to consume a video for 30 seconds for $8 million. But the Super Bowl can. No meta, no Google, no, all the other things influencers, TikTok. There's no combination that can get there like the Super Bowl can. The problem is if your video's bad, you just wasted all the money. The creative is always gonna be the variable of success. But buying the attention, yes. And buying the attention, the Super Bowl is the best. Let's talk about ingredients of success. What's more important? Work ethic, talent, or passion? Yes. Look, you know this. I mean, look, the reason I like work ethic is it feels very controllable. It's like working out. Like, you can get there. Working out came really not natural for me. I didn't do it at all until I was 38. Like, at all. I didn't have a muscle in my fucking body. So if I, who despises it to this day, can get to a level of discipline that gets me there, I believe people can do the same professionally. I also believe that it's a lot easier to do that level of work ethic when you're actually passionate about it. So it's a very, the reason I answered the way I did, yes. All three, different for every one of us in here. But of the three, work ethic is controllable. And it's something that I get scared that people try to downplay. Look, as someone who's unfortunately been tagged with hustle, culture, and things of that nature, I have been consistent. Had Ariana Huffington on the Ask Gary Vee show a decade ago. I believe in sleep. I just think work ethic matters. Not to burning yourself out and being sick, that's stupid. I am worried that people are using health and wellness and mental health. And all these great things that are important as weapons to create entitlement or to create laziness or to justify non-action. And I think that's a mistake. I believe that work ethic is the most important ingredient in success of our success. Cause as you said, you can control it. I have something called Philo first in, last out. And I do a lot of coaching as I know you do as well. I tell every young professional, even mid professionals that come to me, hey, I'm not liking my job, whatever. If you're the first one and the last one out, great things are going to happen to you no matter what. I think that's exactly right. Because even if you're in an environment that doesn't reward that, you're going to learn that it doesn't instead of leaning on excuses, which will empower you to make the tough decision of leaving. I fully agree with you on that. That's not my favorite topic, which is preparation. I'm writing a book called Extreme Preparation. I always want to be the most prepared person in the room. How important has preparation been in your success? And are there any examples you can give about your extreme preparation leading to something successful in your career? My entire life. So my favorite thing, and Sid just stepped out with Dustin's here, so I'm going to look at him. Dustin actually probably knows this better than Sid. The thing that baffles all my top executives when they start at my company is I go into meetings cold and dominate them. They think I do no prep. They make me huge decks and because of the way we do our decks, they can see I didn't open it. I walk into the meeting, brand new client. And they are baffled. It's one of the best compliments I get. It's so flattering. They are, it is by far the number one chatter, conversation of VPs and above when they first joined the company asking all the other OGs, how the fuck did that just happen? It's because I only am prepared. It's the only thing I do. The reason I can walk into Nike or Smart Water or a t-shirt brand or Lexis or any brand and crush a meeting is because most businesses are not that complicated. I can promise you that what Smart Water wants is to sell more Smart Water. And if they're meeting with me, I'm not talking about supply chain. We're not talking about other things. We're talking about demand creation. So I think preparation is the only thing. The reason I do such narrow things is they're the things that I'm preparing on at all times. The reason I have V-Friends and Wine Library and WineText.com and Gary V is I have to actively work on the craft of marketing and demand creation to feel like I have any ability to talk to anyone about it. I'm a full practitioner of the moment. I can speak about live social shopping right now with the expertise I get because I sold $130,000 worth of clothes on a live stream a week ago. So I think you're on to something very powerful. I would argue that the bad version of it is school and the good version of it is sports. I'm always prepared because I never talk about anything or act on anything or involved in anything that I don't actually do. I think some people study, but they're not about it. And that's where the vulnerability, even with prep work comes in. Because when people start poking and prodding, you start going to 301 instead of 101 level preparation. So I think the ultimate preparation is to actually be a practitioner of. That's why I love entrepreneurs that are investors. They lived it. How important is setting goals in our success? And do you believe in writing them down one three five year seven plan, seven year plan? I think about this one a lot. So again, I play it a little looser as you can tell than black and white. Obviously I've had a goal since fourth grade of buying the New York Chats. I'm sure it's had an impact on my success. All right, there were $7.3 billion today. And it's moving fast with private equity coming in. All right, you gonna buy one day? I think so. My intuition now is that as I get older, I'll start to put myself in a position for extreme wealth creation if I want to. But I'll be honest with you, just to be very clear, the chase of it is the great enjoyment. It's a lot of fun to chase that fucking football team that's pissing me off right now. Anyway, you know, I think people do it different ways. I've learned that I'm not a reader and writer. I'm an audio and visual guy. And so I talk to myself a lot about things I want to accomplish in personal life, professional life. Yeah, I think knowing where you're going is a good idea. But I would argue that the ability to adjust and not be rigid to them is equally, if not slightly more important. If you're gonna do this thing in five years, but clearly something's happened, putting your goal on a pedestal when it does not contextualize the truth of your life at the moment you're in right now is a vulnerability. I think people look at you, they look at me, they look at all these other tech people who have done very, very well and they say, oh my God, that person is rich, they have nice things, et cetera, et cetera. And I think everyone wants to be a billionaire. Not everyone, but a lot of people. And I think that's the motivation. So what's your advice and look straight in the camera. I mean, I talk about this till I'm blue in the face. People who are motivated by money are generally not as successful and they're generally not always happy either. Either, you know, listen, I've read, I think you know this, I talk about this at Nausea. Yeah. I'm gonna say this to the camera. I'm extremely deeply empathetic that the response to this for most people is cool, rich guy, but I'd like to find out. Like, fuck you, easy for you to say, I'd like to find out. We have the luxury of spending time with people that have it and we know how dark some of their lives are. There is just no correlation in any kind of common sense way of money and happiness. It just doesn't, it's black and fucking white. So what I would say is, God willing, if that's what you want, you're able to earn, not be handed, your way to a place where you have it. And I'm gonna tell you right now, when you get there, you will see how right we are, period. Your dad, the one plane said you're gonna be the next Oprah and a V-Con, he wears a hat that said, I'm Gary Vee's dad. Yes. And he's so proud of you. How does it make you feel? Unbelievable. Other than I wish he wasn't so one dimensional and spread some of that love to my siblings sometimes, it's unbelievable. And my dad does it very publicly and my mom does it very quietly and they both mean the same. Making my parents proud is probably my strength and my weakness. It's a big currency for me. I really like making them proud. It feels really good. We're at the end of the show and I always end it with a game called Film of Blank to Excellence. Are you ready to play? Ready to play. The biggest lesson I've learned in my life is, losing is the thing you should always strive for because it makes winning a lot easier. My number one professional goal is... To buy the New York Jets. My number one personal goal is... To have everybody that I love show up to my funeral with a very good feeling in their stomach about who I was. My biggest regret is... My biggest regret is already realizing that as much as I keep an eye on it, I wanna spend even more time with the people I love. The one piece of advice that I give to my kids is... Be a good human being. On their terms. Not how you wanna define it. The craziest thing that's happened in my life is... Fucking all of it brother. You know, I am not detached from how miraculous my life has been and silly things like judging the Miss America Contest when that was something I watched with my mom. To important stuff like getting an email weekly from someone who says that a piece of my content took them out of not only a dark place, but sometimes the darkest, scariest moment of their life. It was super humbling. You read your own email? Yeah. The funniest thing that's happened in my career is... The funniest thing that's ever happened in my career? I mean, probably my first appearance on Conan O'Brien. I could not explain to you how going from operating a liquor store to literally being on the hottest late night show in television in 2007, when that was a whole different game than it is today. It was, and it was funny. If you actually watched the clip, it is actually funny. So I think that's the funniest thing that's happened. The best piece of advice I've ever received is... You know, I know you've seen that because you've done your research. Fuck man. I'm really glad my dad tightened me. Again, I wasn't gonna go sell junk bonds, but I just know that I couldn't be sitting here at the level that I'm at if I didn't fear, like if I didn't put my reputation on a pedestal. 10 years from now, I'm going to be doing... Exactly what I'm doing now, waking up and working on what I want to. 20 years? Same. Are you ever gonna retire? No. And I mean this. Not only am I never gonna retire, my great preference at this point, God willing, is that I'm always operating. Retirement comes as you know in all shapes and sizes. People go to consulting, people go to full-time investing. And I define it as operating. I prefer to be operating something for the rest of my life. If you could pick one trait that's led to your success, that trait would be... Sorry, because I love traits. I was about to answer humility, which is not very seen in Gary V's content. You gotta really know me. Then I was about to say patience, because it has been huge. But I'm gonna go with tenacity today. I'm fucking tenacious, and it matters. The one trait that is most important to somebody else's success who you don't know is... So the one trait that I deem as most successful to someone else's, like universally, a trait that is a good indicator to success? Yes. Tenacity, hard work. If you could be one person in the world, who would it be? If I could be someone? If you could meet one person in the world today, who's alive, who would it be? Who's alive? We got you, this is important. Because the Macho Man Randy Savage is dead. If I could meet one, this is a very interesting indicator of me. I am so insular. I'm very curious. It could really be a lot of people. If I could meet one person in the world that is alive, who would it be? You know who I'd like to talk to right now? Vince McMahon. Do you see the Netflix? Do you see the special? I'm sure the doc, I'm only two episodes in. Let me tell you why, Vince. There's so much there. I'm sure that surprised a lot of people. And I'm very empathetic that there's plenty of there. But the angle in which I would want to talk to him, and what I would want to talk to him about, is strictly around character development. I believe that everything I've accomplished in my career will be dwarfed on my execution of V-Friends. I believe that in 30 years when I sit here and do an interview with somebody as awesome as you, what they're gonna wanna talk about is V-Friends. Nothing of what we've talked about. Sure, they'll touch on it. I believe that Walt Disney and Vince McMahon and Jim Henson are the prominent figures of modern character development. Jim Henson and Walt Disney did it with fictional characters. Vince did it with real human beings, which I think is very fascinating. The other two are dead. So character development, how to get people, by the way, you know who my fourth one on that list is? David Stern. David Stern understood that Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson needed to be superheroes, not human beings. That's what sports is. Steph Curry's a superhero for little short kids, not a basketball player. And that's what I'm gonna do with my V-Friends, and that's why Vince, in this moment. If you could go back and give your 21-year-old self one piece of advice, it would be, don't do a single thing different, because at 48 and a half, almost 49, you're a very happy person. So the one question you wish I had asked you but didn't is, You know, it's so funny. I don't think in that term, because when I'm sitting in this seat, I think I'm here to bring value for the audience. Thus, I have no feelings towards questions. You know your audience better than I do. You're awesome. I wanna do a shout out to Mike Hermelin, who we wouldn't be here but for him today. I just met him. He's a new parent at our kids' school. He just moved to LA, as you know. Yes. He'd been here five weeks. He shows up at back to school on night. And randomly, we start talking to him as we're walking out. And we start talking works at Fanatics. I know someone there and... Here we are. Here we are. Thank you for having me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
