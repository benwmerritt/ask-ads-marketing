Ice coffee hour. Yes in the beginning they asked for those that want to be successful What's something that they should be willing to sacrifice that they don't and you said sacrifice people think the answers go into like time with your friends and family It's real. I'm gonna say something interesting. I think if you're in your perfect pocket, you're not sacrificing I actually think you're being selfish. I think what people need to do is find their selfish place I can watch that three times and I just wasn't sure what you meant by that What I mean that is like you're not sacrificing you're you're happy to give up leisure Sleep family time actually being selfish when you're in a perfect pocket. You're choosing your passion over everything You know how people talk about like obsessed, you know when athletes are training for a fight like everything else is shut out And then for some people that's their entrepreneurial journey for like a year or two or three I guess what I'm a big fan of is not judging You're self or it on a day-to-day basis looking at it as a whole the lack of judgment on One self is the unlock. You're allowed to be selfish and you're allowed to be selfless and Sometimes they mix nicely Sometimes they're out of whack and when you observe it, it doesn't mean like it's all horrible If you're like, oh, I was out of whack. It's not the end of the world fix it I woke up one day at 38 and a half and said my health is out of whack Fixed it and you make decisions if your best friends like yo, what the fuck like where you at like I haven't seen you a bowling I've been seeing a pink gun. I haven't seen you. You know, you haven't been at the bar You're allowed to say yo dust. Let's say we're best friends. Dustin. I'm just this feed friends thing I'm locked in right now. I'm gonna just need you like I love you, bro And I'm gonna try but like the next six months. I just think I'm fucking I'll try to check in You know, we've been boys for 30 years. Can you can you be on the offense while I'm in this cocoon? I'll be there for you when you're in your cocoon, but right now I'm in it You don't have enough those conversations. Oh, nobody does. Yeah that got it. Mm-hmm. Thank you so much, man Go to Shonduras now what space station's really animation YouTube creator. He's just the best he's doing his own version of us There's all great If you want to know how much I love you I literally woke up sick today, which is once in every six years My bones are shaking, but I'm here. I was actually just really excited to show you around a lot of good chats But I was worried that you guys are on that via Daily V grand you want to do some fun stuff and skate board. I'm literally literally here for the meetings We do this every day. This is just normal. This is how normal shit. We show up get into our costumes and just hang out I'm not feeling well, so I'm just trying to hop beverage my way through this double fist. I'm double warm beverage sit there. All right, let's do it One of the powerful things about this team is that none of them really have crazy industry experience They're people that I knew I didn't want to come from a traditional industry pipeline I want to teach in my way, but they've grown from just being okay animators being able to have an opportunity to really grow It's literally how we built the biggest marketing company in the world same thing everybody else came with too much baggage Right the wrong way and these things don't know what they didn't know which it leads to creativity and curiosity Like so all the sense of world Ohio More important than what they're talking about my six-year-old just did a drawing on a tops the chrome v friend And it's worth $250 right now, so get yourself some tops chrome and a six-year-old You get a six-year-old The answers yes Before I even met Sean yeah, right That's awesome. Of course my brother Of course, I don't have the cover so no worries. You don't need the cover actually I can do the line the cover I can say for sure I would not be right here and most these people would not be right here if it wasn't for Gary All the interaction with fans the DMs the care not charging for our apps that we just talked about all that came from putting people first I think I don't think that's my center mentality learned it from this guy And I definitely did not do social media also learned it from this guy, so kind of cool full circle moment Love you brother. So proud of you. It's incredible operation Once my ears go cold weren't trouble Yeah, I do believe for this organization Disproportually the live social shopping I believe that 30% of all e-commerce business in 15 years will be done in a live form full-pledge QVC application of so of shopping and e-commerce and I think you're an incredibly powerful position To be really great at it and I have a funny feeling you're gonna all get like a calendar invite for a live social shopping Town hall soon. I'm excited to watch you all execute that These are the brand new top scrum that just came out all over the game stops yesterday trying to get some extra ones to share With the crew here. They are sold out everywhere immediately in game stops like I don't know what's going on In This is my very first packet not opened one yet So I think I want to do the honors rip in my first pack share with the family. Yes Oh my god, Miles got a big card That is the very very very very lucky black hat. That's our Pikachu That's our that's our main character one of the biggest things for v friends is to change perceptions That are to make them more positive So we made the black hat Instead of unlucky we made him very very very very lucky not to get too deep But the lore of why black hats are unlucky are not grounded in good things And I would like to be the human that changes that lore and so the black hat is the big one. I'm not delusional I've been all over the world. I'm on the board of pencils of promise and charity water There's 800 million people right now that don't have access to clean what so when I think about someone who's like feels bad Because they can't afford an iPhone or has to cancel their Netflix subscription. I Just believe that if people had a better perspective and Simplified their life and became less materialistic and were grateful for what they have versus envious for what they don't have That life would be better And then what I did with certain characters was I know Puma's are cool the reason I made it perspective Puma I wanted the perspective one to be very cool Because I think if six-year-old boys and girls Fall in love with how cool Puma is at six By the time they're 14 they might have some sort of affinity to being having their perspective right and so the story about perspective Puma is He's gonna navigate the jungle And he's gonna help people have a better perspective on We are now in a place in our society where people have weaponized words like anxiety When it's really just inconvenience And that's a bad perspective that's hurting these kids You know a little adversity is now I have mental health issues. That's not good There are people who actually have mental health issues and that's important. Thank God. We don't have a stigma on it But we need a little course correcting so a lot of ambition for perspective Puma that is really Way deeper than I thought it would be. We are here in Utah Somewhere where they're Productive day John Norris is here. It's such a good team No, I was just gonna say typically I want to be back Well, I'm actually happy here like It's like a solar eclipse I don't think so who's filming tomorrow Like you find it You think I'm embarrassed so that all of you are gonna think I can't hustle so hard Who gives a shit like live you know what I mean like live your life
