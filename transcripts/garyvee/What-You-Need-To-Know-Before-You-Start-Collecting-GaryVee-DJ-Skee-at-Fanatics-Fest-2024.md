## Transcript
When you're on the field, sometimes the crowd is cheering for you, sometimes the crowd is booing the hell out of you. If you're willing to hear that, you're not going to be able to play the game. For all of you, whatever mission you're on, a parent, an executive, building a business, these are the two most important fingers in the world. Most people use these fingers to point and blame everybody else. I use these two fingers to stick them directly in my ears so I can't hear the outside, so I can focus on my shit. Attention is the number one asset. The number one thing that I tried to buy from 2017 to 2020 that I got outbid on and regret every day, I famously passed on Uber early and missed out on $400 million. I did a lot of things that didn't work out. I believe me not buying that Tupac prison pass, a license. I think everybody knows the first time you do something, it is always the hardest time. So for this to be year one, for them to pull it off, I think even the most cynical or hater people that want to find things that are wrong instead of finding things that are right probably understands like this is an incredible execution for year one and I'm sure all of us are hopeful and optimistic that next year becomes bigger, better and better. But yeah, I think we have so many great things like the national, we have other great things like All Star Weekends and sports, but they're hard to get to, they're infrequent and something like this I think hopefully inspires other entities to do this. I think as sports fans, which I'm going to assume a lot of us are, we're hungry for more stuff. And so when the community can get together, and I think by far the thing that stands out for me the most is that Michael Rubin and Fanatics has the leverage to get the leagues to come and show up proper. Like there's not a lot of events where we can run the 40 yard dash or come out to the WWF theme. That's so cool. So I think for year one, yes. Ski. Now my question for you, actually let's hear it for DJ Ski the Legend. No, no, no, that's some bullshit in the morning. He's a Vikings fan, bro. I need to hear it loud for you. Let's hear it for Ski the Legend. Speaking of the hobby or sports, early on when I got excited that I thought it was coming back in 2017, 18 and started to get loud. You were one of the first people that hit me up and said, hey, like this, I see a tour. Is this happening? You were excited. What has happened from your perspective? What has happened in the last seven years about this popping off? I mean, a lot of these who still we say, right, like modernizing the green into a new generation and bringing it up to a level they deserve to be in. Right. Like for so long, so and it felt like not much had changed since the 90s. The brands, the experiences around it. Then you started seeing reds, I think it's getting really invested bringing pop culture. Right. It's like the fact that you have some of the biggest hip hop stars in the world walking around this. We've got a collapse. The fact that you have these type of experiences that bringing a whole new generation, right. And it's not just a car show with the boots and tables. You have that over there. It's awesome. Let me just say this. I'm sorry to interrupt. I went to the national in 2018 in Cleveland. And the first thing that came out of my mouth is where's the kids? Just even the amount of kids that are now in the hot. There wasn't like I was a 14 year old that was swinging the cards in the 90s. I thought that's what I was going to see in Cleveland. There was like three dozen. Now there's thousands of kids. I mean, these kids came up to me is like, yo, this kid's 14. He's making 20 K. I mean, like that is like it's unbelievable that shift alone. 100% of him might seem he will come in that aren't necessarily card fans. I brought a friend yesterday who's a diehard sportsman. Doesn't know anything about cards. He walked in and he's trapped about activations, right? Like WWE made these for the fourth calculations. I've seen it. It's a lot. Ever. And then he came in and started like buying cards. He has to walk back. It's like, what is this? What's going on? Wow. These are worth that much. What's the case? What's the grade? What challenge we have is how difficult the on board is, right? This is like, why is this one so far $20 on $20,000? So I think like that is an incredible boost. So bringing people in is so important. You see so many kids walking around and I think that's going to be so good. And why we need things like this? It's not just about a few of the collectors that exist today. It's about awarding and inspiration. We all want it. It's funny you say that this may land for a lot of you in the audience. I played. I started playing fantasy baseball in 1992 and that was on some nerd shit. Like people were like, this is people are like, this is stupid. I got made fun of by my homies in high school and then you go 20 years later and people live for fantasy football, even basketball now, which everyone said would never happen because it was complicated. For me, that's what's happening with trading hearts. I think seven years ago, six years ago when I was starting to make all the content, I had a lot of home. You, which is why I'm thrilled to share the stage. You saw it and we're excited. But 90% of my friends were like, this is stupid. Are you okay? Are you having a mid-life crisis? Like what's happening? And similar to gambling, which is obviously legalized and now people do it similar to fantasy to your point for a lot of people here that are in the hobby. I think we're early. I think when you think about five to 15 years from now, you will have many more of what you just said. I think the national is an iconic trading card event. But when I think about fanatics fest, the fast that it's bringing so many sports fans who then trickle into the hobby, I think this will be over time one of the most significant onboarding platforms for the hobby. And I think that's a great thing. And I really do think trading cards sits with fantasy and with gambling as a higher percentage of sport fans are doing it. Yeah, and you know what's interesting? Going back to when we first started talking. Let's switch seats too while you're doing this. So, what's it for sure? Let me fix something. Thanks to you guys for having me. I was happy to be able to do it. Thanks to Loud Voice for the lecture. Here we go. Jeff Spans. When I look around, right? The companies that are around today that are some of the biggest didn't exist in 2018. Fanatics collectibles didn't exist. Trading platforms like what happened didn't exist. Shops like Bigger Trading, my favorite one here in New York didn't exist. Even when you look at brands like Arena Club, which have done such a big job onboarding, a beef type of collector with all the work solutions, trading, trading, all these things didn't exist. We see all these things that isn't as out there. We're reducing the future going kind of next to this in the hobby. What else do we need to do? Well, I think for me, like again, talking about these kids, that was 14-year-old me, but doing trading cards or sports collectibles professionally at the highest levels was not conceivable. So, I think you're indoctrinating so many young real entrepreneurs and for them, they don't think that they need to go to Wall Street or they need to go into a corporation. They're going to say like, this is what I'm going to do for a living. And I don't think that means that they're just going to be dealers. They're going to invent the AI grading company. They're going to invent the new, I mean, look what I did. I grew up with this stuff and I invented V-Friends to go along with my collecting. So, you know, I think you're going to continue to see more and more companies grow. I have to get right into actual sports for a minute. I see a Vikings fan sitting there. I see my fellow Jets fan sitting there. I got to go to this question. Obviously, when you draft the quarterback, ski is a huge Vikings fan. When you draft the quarterback early in the first round, you have all these dreams and excitement. Obviously, it's devastating and it happens so infrequently when the kid gets hurt in pre-season's out for the year. I, on the other hand, am pretty convinced that Sam Darnold is going to step in now and be remarkable and it's going to frustrate us die hard Jets fans. What's your, what's your observation for the Vikings upcoming season and what's your prediction for Sam season? Great question. I think Sam, even talking to that before Jets, right, was, it was excited about me. He doesn't have the right situation. Football more than any other sport is about system. It's about coaching. It's about the kid playing around you. You can get that quarterback. If you're running a district system and you're, you know, running for a sport, you're not going to work no matter how great it is. So if you're really good, he's young, he has the opportunity, he's had the experience. So I mean, interesting this before the entry, like I was like Jets, probably, red shirt. Right. Like, I think, I think, I think people forget that my home sat for a year. Right. Like there's, when you look at the NFL, like a lot of, you know, obviously off of Stroud's season last year, you can get very confused. But like I see a Josh Allen jersey there. Like until that third season, it was like touch and go. Obviously the Jets have had massive headaches trying to find their guy. And I think when you look around the league and in history, players that were able to sit, right, I mean, Bradshaw sat for multiple years. I think there, I think it's underestimated how many, I mean, Brady didn't start his first, obviously it was a six round pick. That's a whole different game. But like some of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Now with the way the NFL is, where the way the contract works, they get them out there because once they become free agents, so things have changed. But yeah, I mean, I think for JJ to watch for a year even hurt. I think could have been a good thing. It could be a strange joy, like Weston discussed right now, we just have the pressure where his fans are like, when is he starting on a gas? If he's starting this, there's a lot like wrong, right? I mean, I'd love not to be a crowd of them, but we'll see if we find them. I mean, Chad's, how are you feeling this? Well, I feel like we're definitely going to win our game in London this year against the Vikings. Yes. I'll be there. Are you going to go? Okay, you will see. Can I convince you to go? It's going to be a lot. You can't go. Maybe, by the way, kids, let me teach you something. Maybe is always no. Maybe is always no. Right? Maybe is always fucking no. Let me preface this. I want everyone to understand what kind of jet span I am. I have not missed a single snap in real time. No DVR. I have not missed a single snap of a New York Jets game since 1982. I am a full diehard. What's the biggest thing you've turned down? I'm sure there were so many big weddings. Weddings? Weddings of like decent friends. Funerals of acquaintances. Just to put into context. I once had power outage and had a run down state. I've done a lot of crazy things to make sure I haven't missed a snap. I am normally pessimistic. I'm an optimistic person in real life. The one bizarro version of me that's different is Jets Gary. I always think it's going to be bad. The second Aaron Rodgers fell to the ground last year. I immediately went to he's out for the year. It's always been out for the year. I'm always negative. I really, really think that they were going to be a very good team this year. Obviously the problem with the NFL, I'm a diehard Knicks fan. The Knicks got banged up last year and still could have a very good year. The NFL is different. The Bills have already lost Milano. J.J., it's the only sport that you can't be calm about. We could be 11 and an O and then Sauce Gardner is out for the year and our defense is completely different. If they stay fairly healthy, they are deeper than they've been historically. It's a strong roster besides the top line. Just to remind everybody, the New York Jets have the longest drought of not making the playoffs in all four major North American sports. It hurts. We're sad. I do think this is the year that we snapped the drought. I don't know if we can get to the ultimate level, but I think it's a playoff team and I'm excited about it. Please don't talk about droughts or talking to me about sports. It's championship. Not something in this championship anymore. No, it's been a while. How old were you in that year? That was what, the twins? Yeah, so. You remember? That's what got me into sports, right? That's what started me in the hot mean, right? After the season, I was like, how do I still have all this adrenaline for the baseball season? How do I stay connected? That's what really looked me in. What was it when you were a kid? What was your first card? I have a very weird trading card first memory. I had a friend who used to come for the summer. I didn't know what divorced parents were. I was always confused why he was only there for the summer. His name was Eric Conrad, and he was obsessed with building card houses. You know, like playing cards and like building little card houses. People used to do that. And one day I came over and he brought out some baseball cards to make the little card houses out of not just playing cards. And I couldn't believe that Don Mattingly, who was my hero, I was a huge Yankees fan growing up, that there was a card of Don Mattingly. Immediately I ran to something called Crousers. I don't know if anybody knows that in the Jersey area. It was like R711 of Northern Jersey. I went to Crousers, bought a pack of 84 FLIR, and it changed my whole life. And over the next 12 years of my life it was the most important thing to me, trading cards. It was such a big deal. I went from that to by the time I was in eighth, seventh and eighth grade doing card shows in the malls of New Jersey. And so my earliest memory was not even about cards. It was about building little card houses. And that switched it for me. How about for you? Yeah, I was just after 91.20 and I started going after every 20-player. Can't hurt back. Can't hurt back. And then as the years went on, the 90s were the warrior. My favorite set I just did an interview talking about is comments like 94 upper deck piece. The electric-dive and coil parallels are so cool. My favorite card I have, and I have, I think we bought a million dollar card, is an 800 dollar ticket for each junior electric-dive and PSA 10-parallel. Tough to find in that grade and vision, but not extremely valuable. Those cards look so cool in those 90s inserts. I still love, I was walking around at all the tables yesterday looking at what could be the short inserts. And like that's my era. I've just seen those cool designs. It was so amazing. Yeah, I think, you know, it's funny. The 90s, one of my favorite things about the hobby, and this is like a really interesting thing for anyone who's in it or considering to get in it, is what's expensive and valuable today is not guaranteed to be that tomorrow. People I think understand that they're scared to buy something that will go down. I think the biggest thing that's not talked about yet is what's underpriced today can be valuable tomorrow. Those 90 inserts, nobody cared. Nobody cared. What I'm very into, vintage basketball. Vintage basketball. Vintage baseball has always held the heart of this industry, but vintage basketball, even into the late 2017, 1890, will Chamberlain, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, not a lot of demand, but because there's so few of them, just a little demand creates the curve for a lot of people. Look, my biggest pet peeve right now with the hobby is it's expensive. It's hard for an average kid, if you're a top 1% wealthy kid, fine, but for an average kid, I saw a video yesterday that there's a score pack at Walmart right now that's like $23 for 100 cards, and I was ecstatic. I read all the comments and everyone's like, this product's shit and cheap, and it's such a wrong take. There's so many people in this country, I mean I don't have to talk about the state of the economy and inflation. A lot of kids, $20 is a lot of money, and so what are you going to buy? And so I'm happy to see that, and I'm hoping, and my number one combo with Reuben is like, we need less expensive cards. Kids need to be able to get in. Comma, there's some inserts that I'm looking at right now that are visually very attractive, but are common-ish. So they're not very valuable, but my 20-year from now brain is like, you know what? I think people like, I'll tell you the one that's most on my mind, the lottery ticket insert for NBA Drapics, right? It's like a good looking card. They're not very sought after. It's not in the most expensive packs, but in 20 years, when they've all been rummaged through the commons boxes and are banged up because they're not valuable, the visual of it. And all you need in 20 years is 100 people to all agree that they like it. I mean, and so I think for a lot of people that are, I think this is the single best advice ever, collect what you want. Not what you think is going to go up. And I think if you collect what you want, if you really stay that course, there's a lot of opportunity because I think the biggest issue right now in the hobby is that people are gambling, right? They're buying very expensive wax hoping, or they're speculating on every rookie when 90% of them don't pan out. And I think that's one of the big challenges in asking, right? Like we all saw this market accelerate. And one of the reasons was, I think a lot of people came in slowly looking for money, right? Like they didn't care about putting together a set and collecting for them. It was like a lot of people were just looking for speakers, they're looking for cards and stuff, which is okay. But then when they step away and find the number of steps, like a teaser or whatever, it's like in a lot of people are less kind of folding the bag and it goes like the market comes down. We kind of have that cleansing, we're now like at the least kind of state. Oh, I think the market is as stable as, like I think it's an, and I'll tell you why I love it. A lot of people here have seen what's happened the last seven years. So it's harder for it to be replicated, right? So, and it's a strong base. I mean, the hobby, people love to talk about the COVID era as they've got feelings about it. It's the single greatest era that ever happened for the hobby. Look at where it's at right now and people learned about speculating. So it's only up from here. Yeah, and I think like to your point, right? Like, things are forwarding the generation. When I was a kid, I worked for 89 Griffey, right? Looking for, that was the most bad thing. It was $110 or something. I couldn't afford it. That's what I dream for. Now, like $100 people looking like we have a cheap card outside. That's about 100%. And it has to be more than like, like, let's chase this on a one that's worth half a billion dollars. That's not sustainable. Let me ask you a question. I think this will be interesting for the crowd. You know this because I think we've talked about it once. My biggest observation is that the next wave is non-sports trading cards. I'm obsessed with fictional characters. I personally am obsessed with fictional characters, but even like rapper trading cards. I mean, obviously when we saw Travis, you know, obviously I have my own intellectual property with B-Friends, but me as a collector, I kind of get excited about finding like Popeye the Sailor Man's rookie car. I'm being serious now. I know that like people giggle at this, but the same way they giggled eight years ago about trading cards. Like here's where I'm at. Fred Flintstone is way more famous than 98% of athletes. And I think, you know, obviously you have a huge music background, whether it's actual human beings that are famous or fictional characters. I think that there's a big, brewing, quiet wave. And I do think fanatics, if you look at what Michael, you know, when I take a step back and look at what Reuben's doing here, when you're bringing pop culture people like Druski, when you're bringing people like Travis Scott, when athletes are getting into collecting like Grant Williams getting addicted after pulling a monster ruka, I think there's a lot to know. What's your take on non-sports trading cards? You personally. I'm all in. I mean, obviously like music is my foundation. And when I started making cards with tops, my theme was basically making like my mixed-in cards, right? Like it was remixing these classic sports cards, taking Kermit Puget and mixing him with Prince of Purple Rain, right? Taking somebody like Ronald Lacuna and Kexin Irvath and Karko like outcast AT Allianz one. And then I started actually involving some of the artists, like our friend, Dan Heese. I did a Derek Jeter card and, you know, it's the same time like Wu Tang Clan, I had the show on Hulu. The season was launching, so we like put him in it in the background. I was like, hey, he's correct. And in the launch event, we could like set this thing off. So I think this whole thing's happening. You see the Travis guards, people would be breaking that in. We just did it. The realist, big collaboration with S.M.U.N. Released the whole card as part of that. You know, people were signing up and getting the cards that remind us of the regular events. So I think pop culture is... I think for the parents and grandparents in here, I think what I'm about to say is going to hit. I think if Coco Mellon, a year or two or three ago, put out trading cards, you would have a lot of three, four year old starting to collect. I just think it's super obvious. I mean, for you, yeah, that's... I mean, you made a bold vision like launching defense as a card. If you win all the time, I mean, look at the size of your food and the activation and stuff. What gave you that force like, where about be like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to set a trend. If you don't set that up, you should actually do it. And he's successful. Something a lot of people don't know is this has been on my mind for 20 years, you know, like different like businesses and things of that nature. And you're always thinking and trying to create and things of that nature. So I'm always hoping and thinking when I've always wanted to build something meaningful that was bigger than me as the Gary V brand started to build. I realize I'm just one dude. I also know that I'm not every single person's here to come and take. I have a certain personality. It works for a lot of people, but it's not for everybody. But what I have to say is something I want the world to know, right? I want people to know that you can be a gangster and a killer, but you don't have to compromise being a decent human being while doing it. And I think it's a message that's very confused to people. I think people think you have to compromise your soul for success. And so I always wanted to get that mission across. And I... The thing I started to learn was when I exploded on TikTok, I got younger and I saw the impact. I saw that if I could get to kids at 12, 13, 14, they were more likely to be impacted than the kids I was getting to on Instagram that were 2021, 22. That always means said, if I could get to people at four, five and six, then we could really do shit. And so Pokemon and Disney and Transformers and My Little Pony and Strawberry Shortcake and, you know, all this stuff was always in my head when the NFT and trading card thing was kind of crossing. I said, you know what? It's time for me to take it at that. COVID was happening by a time. And you literally went in and I remember you're like, I'm disappearing for two weeks and trying to make you all these things. And then you came out with this and said, The most fun for me on it really is that the building, right? Like grinding behind the table at Be Friends today on a Sunday in the summer of where I'm at in my career really speaks to me. Like that to me, like the building is the fun part. You know, I think of it as this. Sometimes I go to the beach and you see kids work on a sandcastle for like nine hours. And then they just look at each other and they tear it down. And I see all the faces of people around the sandcastle be like, why would you do that? And I always understand those kids because I'm like, it's about the building, not the castle. And for me, Be Friends is about the building. I don't care if people are pro or con it right now. I'm excited to have the conversation about it in 2047. And to me, that's, it's kind of like being an athlete. When you're on the field, sometimes the crowd is cheering for you. Sometimes the crowd is booing the hell out of you. The problem is you can't accept it. You've got to play the next play. I think entrepreneurship now is playing out in public. And everybody's got a comment in the comments, whether pro or con. Literally every post I have, this comment is a go to emoji. The next one's like, fuck you. And if you're willing to hear that, you're not going to be able to play the game. For me, I can't hear the negativity. But on the flip side, I also don't hear the accolades. Once you get high on your own supply, you become vulnerable. You become very vulnerable. And so I think for all of you, whatever mission you're on, a parent, an executive, building a business, these are the two most important fingers in the world. Most people use these fingers to point and blame everybody else. I use these two fingers to stick them directly in my ears so I can't hear the outside, so I can focus on my shit. If you're focused in these shows, you love going around and getting an answer. Like you said, you've been successful in a lot of other businesses. You're not being able to do this. People in our department say, oh, there is a flip card. There it is. You just flip card. You can't bump into other cars. You've got a lot of other ways you can do that if you really wanted to. You enjoy walking. This is every... It's like national. Is your favorite identity here? I literally, literally woke up at like 6.30 this morning out of pure excitement that I was going to be here all day. Allowed me to get a nice workout in. I got a little work done. But like my body, like I need sleep. I work like a fucking crazy man, but I still woke up at 6.30 this morning because I knew I was going to be here because the adrenaline is so high. I'm like, I'm going to be sad. I don't know if any of you like get way up for things and then when it's over, you get like that big crash. Like I'm going to be super sad around 4.30 today because I know this weekend's now over. And I got to wait for the next one. And so I love this industry. I love sports. I love my friends that I've met through the years. And I really enjoy meeting new people that have similar interests and ambitions and hopes. And so I'm incredibly happy to be here. And I ask all of you, I'll be at the Be Friends booth most of the day. Please come and say hi. I'd love to say hello. What's the best Be Friends pick up somebody to have an audience? They want to get it. My friend actually went to this booth like I said yesterday. It's the first pack of cards for this Be Friends series too. What's the best code you can get out of that right now? Oh, there's one of ones that like I will tell you for all of you that have not looked into Be Friends yet, if you open your eBay app right now and type in Be Friends and go to completed items sold, you will shit your pants. Like stuff like there's such a significant market for it. But it's early. Like I have 20 years of perfect execution to get halfway to Pokemon. So it's like there's a lot of work to be done. On the flip side, it's already happened. Now it's just building on top. But there's one of ones in those $30 packs that sell for five, four, three thousand dollars a piece. It's humbling. And I think different than other startups that have come with all due respect to Metazoo or other things that have come along. For me, I know I'm doing this forever and I don't want to sell it back to building the sand castle. I don't want the exit. I need to build this for the rest of my life. That gives me enormous confidence of like that every day because the issue with building anything is once the person stops caring, it's over. When the founder, some of you worked for startups. When the founder sells the company to a bigger company, it's over. No matter what they tell you, I have company wide meetings in my marketing company VaynerMedia where I talk in front of all of them and literally tell them, if I ever sell this, I'm going to have an all company meeting and I'm going to tell you it's going to be great and this lady that just bought it, she's amazing. She's the only person I would have sold it to. This is going to be phenomenal. And I'm going to say all of that, but I'm telling you all of you right now, the day after I sell it, quit. I don't think I'll ever sell VaynerMedia because it's the foundation of what I do and I know I'm never going to sell V-Friends. I may take it public, but I will never sell it. And so it's what I've wanted to do. I feel like my life has gotten this point to where I can build this brand and I'm very fucking focused on it. And so yeah, I think you could pull a lot of stuff. But like with anything, if like two of you right now are like, wait a minute, I want to start collecting V-Friends. The core advice is always the same. Before you collect anything, spend hours doing research. Way too many people jump in. The biggest mistake that people make is they jump in and they just start buying stuff. The biggest opportunity for everyone here is education. Do your homework. You're like, oh, you bought a hat straight and what is this? Brady company, you just say, it was PSA, right? You don't know things, so he willing to do that and jump in. What's so interesting is, look at this next generation. We talked about kids, where do you see the opportunities for them to get in? Because like I was serious about this where you were the most good at the project. Yes. Basically, architecture. Same thing down here, right? Like there's some groups that are like, you know, dollar box. I'm telling you right now, like again, I grew up so poor. Like I wish I grew up in the dollar box era. Like for anybody here who really doesn't have a lot of money, which is many, many people, because it's so expensive, the dollar box is unbelievable. The dollar box is here, buying for a dollar and selling for seven on eBay, day in and day out, three, 10, 50, 500 cards over a week, a month, a year. It's also my favorite thing about telling kids to get into dollar boxes is what they learn. If you learn that hard, because the dollar box is hard work, you got to sit there and go through everything, you got to be educated, you can't sit there and look up everything, you got to put in hours of work. But when you get to that level and you can walk through this place and buy a hundred one dollar cards, go home, take a photo of those things, put in that grind and get 2,000 out of it, a thousand out of it. You do that a couple dozen times in a year. All of a sudden you wake up and you've got $24,000. And when you're 15, it's really hard to do that. And you get a lot of money that you can take and take in other jobs that target McDonald's. And so the dollar boxes are huge. We're about to leave, I want to make sure I get this off. Ski, just because you won't do it if I don't ask it. So I want to put you on. What do you want all these people to know about? What are you working on? What's exciting to you? What are you doing? For me, I want to be the realist. Say it slow, I want to make sure. So we basically are going to artists to take things like Soup Dog. We're interested to show kids it's both a roach of money. I'm going to give a roach of a lesson for $5,000. People are like, that's crazy. When you think of Snoop, it's an icon. What's the first thing you think of? It's a weed. 100%. And it's like that is going to be a piece of evidence for $100K after it passes. Right? Huge, huge things. So we think there's just so much opportunity that really starts with authentication. We want to take it from some of the things that most usually baseball is high-tier and the wickets based on authentication and build something up to do it for a risk-raider. So, we're going to win that. Right? I think it comes from this journey of starting in collectibles and cards and seeing where the blanks face ones. So for me, it was diving in and getting to an authentication at the highest level with the biggest partners. We're doing, you know, last year's tour now is 68, but it's getting set list. It's not like most of your stuff is behind. It's cool. He just did, you know, Super Bowl halftime show. My biggest supporters in the fall. And now, because fans have never had a way other than buying merch. On this note, the number one thing that I tried to buy from 2017 to 2020 that I got outbid on and regret every day for folding and wish I went to the max was in 2019 or 2020, Heritage was selling Tupac's prison license. It was, you remember, I came in second and it will go down as one of my, I famously passed on Uber early and missed out on $400 million. I did a lot of things that didn't work out. I believe me not buying that Tupac prison pass license will be one of my biggest regrets. I'm so like, when you were just talking about what you're doing in my stomach, I'm like,
