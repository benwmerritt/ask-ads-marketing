Expression my mother often uses that you do the right things for the right reasons and you live with the consequences You got your perspective I just want to be happy don't you want to be happy? Everybody it's Gary Vaynerchuk Really exciting day for me because I admire the gentleman that I will be interviewing quite a bit and have for a very long time and We're we spent two seconds getting to know each other talking of course football and we'll get into that in a minute But as many of you know who follow my content I haven't done a whole lot of interviews lately and to be frank I think that interacting with all of you and answering your questions has been really fruitful and I want to save the interviews on the podcast For special occasions one that excites me or one that I think can disproportionately bring value to the audience and this show It's on both fronts so without further ado, I'd like to introduce Arthur blank to the show I will let this prestigious gentleman introduce himself because I'm curious to hear how he positions himself these days and he's got a new book out and I know How how much my audience has enjoyed getting to know authors? Around books and have been big supporters. So I hope the Vayner Nation can Climb some Amazon and Barnes and Nobles ratings and things of that nature. So Excited for the new book good company. So Arthur, how are you? I'm I'm fine. It's an honor to To chat with you for a little bit the other thing which we share and we should probably share a lot of things in common But we we both came from Queens. That's right and so I have that you know that diversity and that life experience in my in my background but Today I you know, I co-found the Home Depot in 1979 the first stores and left in 2001 and we were the second largest retail in the world at that time and Today it's the company has a book value or capital value I should say are close to 300 million 300 billion dollars and a transition into a variety of other things To the Atlanta Falcons, which you mentioned the land united on Major League soccer team We operate the PGA towards superstores, which is the largest golf retail in America today We operate several guest ranches in Montana rated number one in the western part of the country and we have a very active and philanthropic family foundation so We're involved a lot of things and I think the beauty of the book and the essence of the book is that All the values that we cultivated and developed at Home Depot for 23 years and now being Shepard along beautifully by Craig Manier and their whole team Are the same values we put in place in all of these different industries in different settings different geographies with Fans customers and guests all three of them through our associates and connected to the communities that we live in and really the emphasis of the stories and the thoughts throughout the book is that You can't have both profitability and emphasis on the people side of the equation. In fact, if you're going to have Good us really going to achieve both at high levels You need to you need to achieve both you need to put emphasis on both of them and one feeds the other very strongly So It's a great book and not because I wrote it's not really about me But it's about the values which we think are transportable Virtually every business for profit or non-profit is a case may be Arthur I think this is where you know, we share a lot of perspective You know to me I call my Vayner X my universe. I call it the honey empire, you know, I have enormous ambitions You know, I'd like to match the accomplishments you have especially because I want to buy the New York Jets and and and But I also think that you can do that with honey over vinegar. I'm uncomfortable actually in deep negativity and bad human traits and You know, I I enjoy the part of my career right now because I have a lot of kids watching me on these social networks And words, you know, I started a wine brand. It's called empathy You know, like these things to me and you were pioneering it before I think people are confused that you don't have to kill people or be mean to be a successful business person I think that's what I heard in your opening statement Yeah, well, I I think not not only uh, you don't have to be that way I think it's it's counter being successful. I'm measuring success really in uh in in in two ways One is the financial results, which obviously is what most people conventionally would think of but also in terms of having purpose in life and You don't have to be Someone like a deepak choper who's a good friend and endorse the book and read it But but you you have to understand that, you know, young people today Today particularly I think are striving for More purpose than I think they've ever ever done so in the past an example and you're probably familiar with this Is dr. Laurie Santos who also read the book and endorses it Who has a professor of psychology at university? She started this course as you probably know on on on on happiness happiness lab because 30 40 kids Said to it has to be more in life than just this that's to be more in life than just making money etc and being successful She now as many of your listeners may be aware she now She teaches that class to a quarter of the student body of Yale university at a time one quarter It's the largest enrollment class I've ever had in the history of you 205 years old and it's now available to everybody online. So Pass that on to your listeners too. It's available online and it's done beautifully. So Arthur let me just ask a question. I'm sorry to interrupt but I want to get so much out of you in this short time together Yeah What kind of kid were you like? I'm very very curious. Well, I was very competitive. I was very competitive I you know and my focus really growing up with sports I played football ranch rack played baseball, you know from my high school and Uh, and I was really good athlete. I would say um, not good enough to go to the next level And I pretty much banged myself up to my junior year playing football. We had a great football team at stuyveson high school in new york Our my junior year. We won all of our games average score was like 44 to 6 I think something like that So we we had a really good team. We had a bunch of uh, young men that went on and got full scholarships and played well and collegially but um More you're always a big competitive Where you're you know, so I don't know if you know this because I know you know It sounds like you knew the queen's part, but I was actually born in Belarus in the former soviet union And I yeah, and I came over in 78 When they let when they let a small amount of Jews out when israel and america you might remember this jury was able to get you know So that that is you know my origin story and I've always felt and I tell a lot of my Contemporaries in their lake 30s early 40s that are business men and women that are some good man when we get into these dinners I'm like you have to understand I'm far more like your grandfather Than I am like you because I lived in a studio apartment with you know, seven family members like I remember that this is not my You know, I think that you you Grew up in a queen's in your in your years a Was it your parents or your grandparents that came over from the old country? It was my grandparents, right? So so to me I'm curious how much do you think the environment? That you grew up in lent itself to the acceleration of your competitiveness because it's obviously a dna game But it's also clearly an environment game And looking at your timing of when you're growing up in queens I'm always romantic about that era as a historian because I think a lot of good chips on shoulders and ruggedness that led to great success to your point both happy and Outeristic and you know kind of financial There's a lot of men and women that came from that era and I you know There's something in the water is something you hear a lot I feel like there's something in the water for those italian jews irish men immigrants Kids and grandkids of immigrants in that new york at your era. Well, you know, that's a really good point and I I think You know, I think yes, there was something in the water And I think the water and that point was going going through the experience of your parents coming through else island Settling in lower Manhattan often without anything to speak of financially We were working any number of jobs to just you know to just maintain You know a sense of of keeping family together and supporting each other and and so I think you know the notion of Overcoming that form of diversity if you will or those challenges wouldn't say adversity but challenges I think we've really done done beautifully by our families and So I think in my family, you know given the fact I lost my dad when I was only 15 years old He was 44 and and so I think that that puts some you know emphasis on my mind Another another connection point for us and I realized my father At the same ages on both his father and himself lost his dad at 15 when my grandfather was going Yeah, that's amazing. Well, that's real connection. Yeah So, you know, my mother's my mother went into his business without any background that he had started in his early 40s And she ran it beautifully and eventually sold it and so I think you know the notion of pushing through challenges looking for challenges looking for opportunities to To enhance to make the world a better place if you will My mother was a woman of principle. I think that became very important to me at an early age and Expression my mother often uses that you do the right things for the right reasons and you live with the consequences I think that's you know, I think that stayed with me for many years and And drives a lot of the the cultural aspects of what we talk about in the book I'm gonna I'm gonna stop you there because I think when people ask me why I have this honey empire thing And I literally say my mom my mom You know, first of all, I share her DNA. So being nice and kind and by the way, I'm uncomfortably competitive Which actually confuses people actually a good question. Arthur since you're you know Many years and success ahead of me on this journey, but I'm very curious You know, and maybe it's the climate we live in today because obviously, you know It's always a timing thing, but do you feel that people actually Confuse Individuals that are competitive and don't realize that it's actually very easy to coexist with kindness and competitiveness But that sometimes competitiveness, especially in the heat of the moment Manifests to something that seems a little bit more aggressive and not naturally kind and that confuses some outside observers Yeah, I think it can but you know, you people That I have great respect for Even making Being as firm as they want to be making the points they need to make and strongest need to make it Have always found a way to do it with with a degree of kindness And I go back to dr. King two of his closest disciples Our close friends in mind one just passed away john louis Who was a you know, very close friend and andy young who still lives in atlanta two of the closest Dr. King and you know another gentleman who wrote the photo in the book jimmy carter One of the kindest thoughtful most caring people I've met in my life and yet extremely competitive I mean there's a story I talk about in the book where we're climbing climbing rocks together with an outward bound course And his wife got up on top sooner than he did so I said, you know, mr. President This is after you left office Have you had enough? I remember looking me sweaty sweaty sweaty eyes every you said no We said I'm we're not leaving until I make this climb and he did but you know So I I think you can have both. It's you know, it's funny. I agree But the way I think about it obviously Then you a lot of people don't realize how much success you have in uh soccer proper football with your club there too I do think the physical manifestation versus the boardroom communication style does have a little bit of a tweak Right, I see a lot of people to your point that I see do a great job in the boardroom Managing their people managing up down left and right But then you get them in a pickup basketball and they're throwing an elbow in your chest because that's where you get to see the physical manifestation I think that you know, I I can relate to that and I would say that's I was always very competitive and I still am today and I don't like to lose anything. I remember A brief story. I remember my wife and I when first first year we got married we played scrabble He played 24 24 the first one Who uh who won 25 games is going to be the champion of scrabble And I told us to our team our football team in 2001. They asked me are you competitive? So we played the last game of scrabble with no time limits on it I lost that we were married 27 years. We never played another game of scrabble. I love you already So, you know, I mean, you know, I don't like to lose but um, you know, anyway, but it's um, what? Remind me is the book out or It's out. It's out It was published of 10 by 15th and it's out available and all the book out bless you can imagine What What has been the most surprising? You know for me, I've written five Business books in one wine book. I grew up in the wine business of all things My dad had a liquor store in New Jersey that I transformed into an early dot com wine business What the one thing I liked through all six of those process was the Feedback because you're in your book for a period of time The feedback that you didn't see coming. I think this would be a fun question that might have some insights any feedback from A random email or somebody close to you of an observation from the book that you had not thought of that you Appreciated or that kind of has caught your attention so far here in the couple of weeks that it's been out Well, I think it's a great question. I don't know but I'll be seeking the answer Because I really and I've told people who've read it or you know halfway through it or whatever I'm really interested in uh in their critique of the book I mean, you know as you've experienced when you write one of these books and you go through them after a while you You fall in love with what you're writing and you you finally sign off on it's the best product You can produce at that time etc. And it tells you story whatever story it may be but You know how other people see it, uh, and there are a handful of people that I have Deep respect for that. I'm interested in getting their feedback. I'm sure they'll give it to me too. So, uh What um, do you look at this as? A legacy piece because you feel like that one of your natural talents and by the way, I'm such a buyer of an important thing You said I have literally told every cfo Overly financially driven friend of mine because I tend to even though I have these big ambitions Obsessed with the process more than actually the dollars that come along with it I've told them all the time. I believe that kindness actually is a practical financial impacter And I was my heart was smiling and my brain was smiling when you said the same Do you view this as a legacy piece for you because you do think that it is a It's a nuance that comes natural to you that you've executed on and your partner's at depot And do you feel like this is something that you think is misunderstood is the way I was? Yeah, I yeah, I do Gary but I but it's interesting because um It was just you know last year In 19 probably a lot of the people that you're referring to well, maybe some of the people you're referring to a part of the business roundtable So in 2019 After 50 years of being in business that roundtable They changed their charter to saying our our emphasis is not just going to be return on on on profitability It's going to be people planet and profits all bounced out Keeping in mind our associates and our suppliers and our communities as well. So even that group of 192 CEOs Even they've changed their emphasis and it goes back to Milton Friedman A great economist wrote you know the book 50 years ago and said the purpose of a corporation is to make one if you share all those period That's the end of the discussion today. I think you know, uh, the view is different. It's changing I think And that's really the emphasis of the book is that I think you can have both And I think you need both one enhances the other It's not that you have to have one or the other or one takes away from the other The beauty of a weighted barbell on both ends that is balanced is that it's equally weighted And I think the story in this book is that those good values That based on human relationships between who you're serving Who's doing the serving and the communities you're living in and profitability Are all equally important at the end of the day You want people that work for you gary or people that have worked for me to feel like this is not just about making money It's about I'm I'm committing myself to an organization that's making a difference in the world It's making the difference of other in other people's lives And your following comes because those people are listening to you Because they because they believe what you're sharing with them is making a difference in their lives To your point i'm reverse engineering bringing value on for them not myself Which I understand the karma of that it has a practical impact on giving the opportunity For myself. It's not super complicated. It's it's good builds on good Exactly right and that's you know when you develop that kind of you know relationship with who you're serving so Like in our stadium as an example We haven't had a couple of good years for a soccer team has been superlative since we've uh, We've you know, saw it the franchise three and a half years ago Last couple years a football team has been you know, very average compared to the Jets may be better But not a whole lot better, but not a whole lot better. By the way, hi, that's great You know, we were by the way, i'm sorry to interrupt you I know we were trying to do this a couple weeks ago schedules We when I you know, I don't want to even bring this up because I know how spicy I get after I I was watching your football game this sunday and I said oh boy This is you know, this dude is gonna be you know because because that one that one hurt Oh, it really hurt. I mean it's just you know when you have that kind of lead you have to go back I mean I you you listen is probably don't even want to know this the Jets may hold a similar record But you have to go back to 1933 when the team scored 39 points at zero turnovers and lost the game So and on top of that we had the we had to turn of a ratio of plus three So I mean anyway, I we've already moved on. We got to play the Bears next sunday coaches players We all moved on we got to go around that real quick. I want to jump in here on this very curious What has there been a challenge transitioning the sports coming from the business world where It feels to me and this is almost the most selfish question in podcast history because i'm starting to mentally prepare For hopefully my great dream coming true You know If you know, I'm already thinking through things like in my business life I feel like I have more control than I do with injuries and football You got to give a gm or a coach some breathing room even when intuitively you're concerned has just out of sheer curiosity How does one find the balance of? Being able to control things for example somebody that has a great interview with you I don't know how many coaches you've had in your ownership But you've been through this i've been through this and even in my young career It feels right right up to the second and then literally a week later to like uh, oh You know, I'm sure you've seen that with players kids. You've drafted. I've seen it My brother left my company and started an nfl representation business as a matter of fact uh, we have uh, we have foyer VaynerSports Company represents your player that forced three football fumbles Fumbles in one game this last week The coach nailed by the way You're very smart guy and a terrific person and a obviously great player probably coach quinn said it'd probably the best Maybe the best 17 minutes of linebackers ever had By the way, even more fun. We also we also represent keith beef the fullback uh, it's uh, and so So very nice young man. Very nice. So we you know, I watch a lot of your team because of that you know Tell me what it took to calibrate the inability to act When you wanted to act which I think is slightly different than running a company where then you have sometimes weight as well But not to the same level of degrees. I think when there's a Sports franchise because of so many other variables in it. Well, I you know, it's really interesting I think that you see one one good piece of advice I got from Robert Kraft who wants the Patriots is a good friend of mine and uh, when I when I bought the team in 2001 we had breakfast together I was in new york with commissioner tag that were going through my owner's orientation and uh, He said why don't you hang around one day have breakfast tomorrow with Robert and I said I'd be happy to do that So I did And one of the things Robert said to me was that you're going to hear from a lot of people that the nfl is a different business You're going to hear that's a different run the nfl run your franchise just like you run the home depot And you're going to be successful now the one thing that's different two things are different one of which you pointed out When somebody has an injury got a bit of matt ryan gets hurt I mean, you know the team's in a different place whereas in business matt ryan breaks a leg He gets a cast on he comes to work the next day so you're not losing him The other thing which is different is that um the amount of media coverage Which is involved with the nfl and therefore all 32 teams is incredible. So When robert said that to me, I said well, you know home depot. We took the company public or second law to street tell in the world today and you know, It's He looked at me and he's any winked like you know, sometimes you do I don't have any children gary If you have a young child sometimes they they won't understand something She'll say at some point in your life. You'll understand this and that's but remember I said it So he's turned out to be right the media coverage on the nfl is incredible um And so you know other than those two things really and that's the beauty of the book it talks about football soccer guess ranching philanthropy golf retailing Same values apply. You have the same kind of successes available and in a balanced way Just for my own enjoyment, where do you sit? You know, obviously so much of my career Is going to be built. It looks like on the foundation of modern communication, right? I was an early investor at facebook and twitter and my communications company spends a lot of time on that In the most ironic of ironic things. I was on a call this morning For the first time by the way in the 11 years that I've run my company with home depot because we've just Won a significant amount of business with scott's miracle grow and we were having a business meeting So it's been a home depot kind of day. Oh great um When I I was just curious and we were having very progressive conversations around Hulu and and amazon prime commercials versus network television commercials We've already seen the nfl start to dabble with amazon, right? There's a lot going on there Just out of general curiosity you the human what is your relationship with the social networks and digital? Have you know, obviously, you know, it comes super natural to the six year olds But it's very interesting to see like do you do you have a linkedin account? Do you have a facebook account? Do you did did any of your you know kids or great kids get you on tip talk? Like where where is you where are you the man on your media consumption on your phone? I mean even a little on tv. Are you a netflix guy? Have you started going into those environments? Yeah, I I am I mean I enjoy watching a lot of the products produced today on television in terms of netflix and and Amazon products etc are outstanding um, I have social media instagram and uh and facebook I don't post anything but I really have them. I told my kids some years ago I have six children so my youngest are two that are 19, but I told them about Six or seven years ago when I went on social media I told them at dinner time That I was going to do that and just you know be able to follow them So you're smiling but at the time my daughter my church wind brother looked at the cross table said Max his name is max her name is kyle. She said do you have an idea what that means? Because you know max was like he said okay She said that means dad's gonna be following us following all of our posts We won't be able to say this that and the other things so you know I have it today because I I do follow my kids And I'll follow some other close friends and they're you know, there's follow any of the players in soccer football team Just out of curiosity. I don't but you know, I follow people like Jay Shetty. I follow deepak I chopper they're both very good friends. I you know, there's some other people Simon Sinek I follow. I mean there there are a lot of people that I do follow I'll follow you in the future. I would definitely follow you if you I will Because you're covering the kind of things and have a kind of personality that I would I would like to learn from So I I think you know opportunities to learn from it. I mean To me there's a story I tell in the book which you know, you may have picked up you may not have when we had an opportunity to participate in eSports and You know, it's a situation. I mean, we're a private company We're not a public company, etc And they came in and our management team had already decided They really wanted to do this. They wanted to participate in it They came in for their final presentation the marketing folks came in And they presented it and one of the slides Was a picture of a young man Who had made as I remember someone got the amount of money He was like 500,000 bucks and he was like 12 or 14 years old But they said he said he practices 10 hours a day 10 12 hours a day To be able to be competitive at the level that he's at So when they left the room, you know the presenting team and our management team was over there I said, we're not going to do this and and they said why are we not going to do it? I said there's nothing to do with our business has to do with our values. I said, I mean, I don't want to I don't want to encourage young people Honestly to sit in front of technology 10 12 hours a day when I think they should be outside and they should be enjoying nature Enjoy playing with each other with a lot of structure time or unstructured time whatever it may be But I don't think it's to their best interests long term I I do think, you know, and you may or may not agree with this but you know, I think Gary that The level of connectivity that we have today in the United States or throughout the world is at an all time high And it's only going to get more so But the level of neighborhood that exists today in the world Is that an all-time low? And I think and I think back to the way you and I were raised in Queens The environment we were raised in we would nurture it in a community Both in and apart and I had four family members living in one tiny apartment. You had eight You live in a community everybody supported each other everybody came together, etc. We need more of that in this country Well, you know to me to me. I think there's first of all from a value filter standpoint I couldn't agree with you more. I think my take to your point where it skews a little bit different First of all the admiration I have for people I mean the amount of money I have left on the table Because I need to feel good about it is extraordinary and it is the single and I'm going to say this very clearly It is the single thing that I'm most grateful for It's just a nice feeling There's no payday interesting enough for me to feel that feeling as a matter of fact It's going to lead to a different question. I wanted to ask you desperately. I just want to get in my mind What I would say Arthur is what I've been able to discover Because I've been so deep in the trenches and I think like anything there's a great, uh, russian saying So how to shortcut of mania basically means Everything's at its best when it's balanced So I think balance is something but who defines balance parents society. There's all those variables I will say that people underestimate the nature of community that is built digitally and the expanding of other views the counterpoint to that is Especially in political times like this People start going only into places where they hear affirmation of their points of view. So there's a whole lot here This is I think it's a four hour dinner conversation in itself. Yeah, let me segue somewhere Let me segue somewhere that I'm very passionate about I'm enjoying something recently that I think about when I think about good company, which is My inability to be candorous In my youth as a manager and leader Because I liked happy and good and honey so much That I would kind of swallow micro little transgressions Unfortunately, though, they would ultimately lead to enough little drops where I would either at my worst Shock and surprise someone and in their firing and then make myself feel better by saying How didn't they realize they stunk and didn't take on accountability over the last two to three years? I would say I was on a two out of ten when it came to candor as a leader Because I over vowed and it led to as you can imagine This is going to make sense to you led to entitlement and a lot of things that I had to work through I think I'm in 6.5 land right now with an eye towards eight or nine and I'm excited about that In your journey to get you to a place of these incredible accomplishments and to be able to write a book like good company What part of the formula do you think you had to work on the most? And get the reps in versus what came extremely natural to you that rounded out your ability to execute good company Well, I would say as it relates to the first Point that you were making, you know, I I'm a prostate cancer survivor and I just got into the psa and was zero. So I'm blessed but But I would say, you know like cancer When you see it you need to deal with it seriously and need to deal with it early if not it spreads So I think when you're dealing with human behavior within an organization When you see bad behavior, you need to address it need to take it on seriously It doesn't mean to fire anybody, but it means that you you know, you address it seriously Yeah, and you know because if not it is going to spread and it's not going to spread just with that person But it'll spread to other people so the expression of bad apple, you know That part of the honey empire was easy The part was I needed to learn a cadence to your point where I would cut the cancer every time It's why I've had what I've had over these 25 years The process of getting to the cutting was something that I was short on I didn't do it in a way that I feel great about in hindsight and I'm trying to build towards Well, I think you know, I think I think that that usually comes because it means somebody You know the whole notion of sink or swimming, you know in in business. I don't believe in you know There's nothing worse than watching somebody die from drowning So if you want to put somebody in a sink or swim situation, make sure they're properly trained Make sure they can swim make sure they can see the shore Make sure you can throw them a lifeguard if you if a life jacket rather if you need to so you know, uh You really want to train people get and put them in the best best place they can be for success And and try to make sure they have all the tools they they need for that You know, if you reach a point I would say with anybody That despite all of that they just don't get it don't fit in don't get your values don't want to leave it So it's not you know really in many in my experience is that you're doing them a favor It's no fun for you to have to beat them over the head for the next 10 years and tell them Constantly doing the wrong thing and they don't get it and they don't get it You know, maybe they just don't fit into your culture. So you do it in a kind way in a caring way You let them go you let them move on to find a different organization that fits more with the way they choose to operate so when I when I ask you The biggest growth of people that you know, because this is we're getting into very Fun territory of me around emotional intelligence and self-awareness and things that really matter, right? If I just say to you think of the people that you've seen grow the most through your years from pre depot let alone depot to today Does it automatically go in your mind? You think of like carol or a susie or a rick or a john? You know, like it's pretty it's pretty powerful to see that kind of emotional growth. No, yeah Yeah, it is and I and I would tell you that you know The the hallmark to the success of home depot It was built on you know products assortment service level product knowledge, etc. Etc. But the truth in matter is to get to 2200 stores where they are today It's really built on just one thing and that's understanding the culture and living the culture I'll tell you one brief story that when mckinsey was writing a book on the war for talent, um, their Partner in chicago the senior partner chicago your hr partner came to visit me last after the interview 200 of our associates in canada In united states and in chile where operating stores there as well And he said, you know, I've talked to 200 your associates a lot engineers cashiers salespeople store managers district managers presidency divisions merchants, etc And every single one of them Talks about the culture exactly the same way. They don't use the same words like it's memorized and just repeating it But they understand the essence of it and they're living it. He said, I don't know how you do that I've never met a company anywhere and all of our mckinsey experience that was able able to do that And I think that's the essence of what makes us successful at home depot And what it's makes all of our businesses successful today is that The price to get into the game of moving ahead and being a leader being a manager Is that you have to understand and lead and be an ambassador for the culture of that Of all of our businesses, which we express there in your own culture So in your case gary, you know, it means that you know, sometimes the people are the best technicians the best this is that You can hire the best of those things But you can't always hire somebody and train somebody to be the best of the culture that you want to reflect in your organization Arthur um How competitive This is a fun question for me. How competitive were you? In seeing how well the book was going to do Well, you know, I to be honest with you I I you know all the all the all the proceeds of being donated to the national Civil Rights Museum in Atlanta, which I'm proud of it's a great place and good news arthur I definitely didn't think this was a financial exercise for you. It's not But but but I was And I know that you didn't need I'm sure there were some buddies you've had that written business books that you wanted to sell one more Copy that you know what I only care about one thing honestly that the book gets out in the hands of as many people as it can And primarily if I had to choose if you pressed me and you might you know, you pressed me well Which population I would say the younger population The people you're you're listeners the people are going to be Thinking about how do I live life with a purpose? How do I run a business with a purpose? How do I connect and not just myself and my family and my own circle of love? But to the greater need of serving humanity in a broad sense And you know, I feel strongly that young people today are pressing on those questions More and more and I think we're blessed by having a younger population that's doing that So I would encourage I mean you that's who you listeners are And and I would I would encourage them continue to press that way And you know, they pick up the book or traded amongst themselves amongst 10 people So I only want to solve but 10 read it. That's all I care about is they read it Do they understand it do they understand they can have that balance in life Where they feel like, you know life is being fulfilling to them and they're getting confused between their work and their play They know that whole zen philosophy is that you don't go to work. You go to play every day And you know, that's kind of what we we try to we try to uh relate to You know, uh, I'm gonna have who set this up connect me with some of your book people. I I think there's some really fun Gamification you can do in social that allows people to act on good behavior To win a copy of the book that I think would probably make you very happy because you'd win on two fronts There'd be good put into the world and another human would consume it And so I That I want to share with you, please. Thank you. That'd be a blessing for me. Thank you Arthur, I you know, I really really don't want to go here because even though you mentioned him as a friend Is you can imagine as a New York Jets fan that has watched every single snap since 1982 I have an uncomfortably difficult situation with the new england patriots This is something we also share, you know that What what can be learned from a moment like that super bowl that must have hurt quite a bit It did, you know, um First of all, it's a you know, it's a certainly a good question. Um You know when you're leading 28 to three in the middle of third quarter you you you almost think there's almost no way to lose the game Um, I mean, I really wasn't thinking first. Yeah, that's right. You know to me. I'm such a cynical Jets fan If you're 49 three with two minutes left, I'm still I am I am I am as well. So I even though it was 28 to three. I wasn't thinking There was a piece of your brain thinking about Some excitement, but you were pretty locked into like I'm not very locked in and as the game started to trend in the wrong direction As we got through the third and fourth quarter It was interesting. My mind went to you know, I'm a father of six a grandfather of six is that you know, how do I How do I be a source of comfort? uh wisdom council support for my family You know our players our coaches our fans Um, so it went away from myself to how do I how do I help others get get through this horrific time? Um, and that's what my focus was. I think it probably wasn't until maybe a year later or so that I I went through the personal, you know, uh pain myself Because I know as you know, you're a football fan 32 teams. It's very hard to get back to the Super Bowl It takes a single game elimination the playoffs or the ball's not round a lot of things can happen and uh, you know Like when I'm at my most down in business and things that nature because of my upbringing And the humble nature and just a deep pain of generational suppression in the soviet union You know, I really do care about something as silly as football. I mean at least it's your team This is like my my fandom and I get into a very serious place I do by the way during covid I had a lot of friends We're still in it But like in the early kind of like first 12 16 weeks I had a lot of friends going through some pretty difficult times and I I really tried to deploy perspective to them of like just be grateful for what you have not what you've lost I remember saying to one friend who was really struggling Hey, you do understand that if covid started eight weeks earlier, kobi Bryant would probably be alive for the next 50 years Let's put this into perspective. I understand you're worried about money I understand you're worried about a wedding which is very important But still let's really put this in perspective. Do you tend to go into that place? I I tend not to go to the dark place gary What I what I what I tend to do is go to the place to be very much like you described I mean, I'm blessed. I have you know, great family. We have we have great great businesses Um our golf business is an example, which is just the counter has taken off I've never seen comp sales and retail in my 50 years of retail that we're experiencing It's just it's just incredible. But you know to our own associates Football soccer Rancid's which we closed the first time in a hundred years. They've been closed You know, this is 2020. We'll get through this. It's a period of time 2021 will be fine We'll go through a transition early 2021 and there'll be fine going on and you know keeping perspective of all things We have blessings over and everybody has blessings over so I also know that like our foundation We've probably granted 40 50 million dollars just dealing with You know emergency situations due to coven in terms of food safety and health and things of that nature. We've helped How many nonprofits just get through this period of time? Because these are great organizations that will do great work in 2021 and beyond that And so we need to help them get get through this period of time. So It's it's it's we had a meeting here last night talking about a variety of things at our leadership team And I said this is a year you take care of your friends You take care of your family you take care of your people that you care about which for us is All of our guests all of our fans, you know all of our customers and take care of your associates And then you worry about other things in 2021 Um, it's just you know, that's the attitude we have to have So tremendously this interview Arthur.
