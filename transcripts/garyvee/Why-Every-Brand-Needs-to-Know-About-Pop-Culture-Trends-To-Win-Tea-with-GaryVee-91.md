## Transcript
People are just not willing to put in the work and be patient. They know the answers. I had seven views when I did one on my TV. 12 views. Everyone starts at the same place. It's just fucking consistency. Trying different tactics if you've done something for months and like, I don't know, people just not put in the work. It's like peer, right? Good athlete. He could have put in more work to his basketball game. He brings so much of his soccer skills. He's just so fucking athletic. But I know because I played with him, if you put in more basketball practice, he'd be even better. He's just going on pure athleticism. It's fucking work. That's life. What do you mean when you say pop culture is currency? What I mean when I say pop culture is currency, I am saying that popular culture, like what people are into. LaBoubous, Kiff, Charlie XL, new restaurants, private clubs in New York, baggy clothes instead of tight clothes seven years ago, hats. Hats when I was in high school, major. Hats after friends came out and everybody who had that haircut, nobody wore it. Hats came back. Like what food, music, Netflix, what shows are people watching? Love Island, like what the fuck is happening? LeBron's second decision, Hennessy, like what's happening day to day in the culture? What's happening day to day in the culture? In every culture, right? What's happening in bull riding culture, UFC culture, the UFC event at the White House? Like every brand, every person, every entity on earth needs to know what's happening in popular culture. Do you know what I Show Speed is doing? Do you know what I Show Speed and Kevin Gates's thing at the LSU sidelines? Do you know that happened or don't you know that happened? Do you know what's happening on the runways on Fashion Week or don't you? Do you know what's happening with Penn State and Texas shitting the bed after being one and two in the top 25? Don't you? Don't you know that the New York Jets are destroying my fucking heart or don't you? Like what do you know that's happening in music, sports, travel? Like what do you know? Like all of that matters to the content you make, to the products you sell. I believe comic books are about to get hot next year. That's why I make them. I believe the card collectors, the sneaker collectors, the watch collectors are gonna collect more and more comics. And then Rips, you might've been in this meeting. Miraculously, this is not a thing I've believed for 15 months. Miraculously, yesterday, we're in a meeting or the other day. I don't think Rips was in this. It was Andy, me, Jim, and DJ. And I was like, what's going on in the world? And both Jim and DJ who are deep in comic culture said they spoke to multiple comic bookstores who said August or September was their best month of business in 20 years. Go ahead, Erin, next question. Okay, we actually had a question in the chat asking about what you were just talking about. They wanted to know how can 40-year-olds keep up with that pop culture you were talking about. Work, it's fucking discipline. I'm fucking 49. The fuck does this have to do with 40? I didn't say teeny bop 13-year-old culture. I don't need you to know what 6-7 is, but I prefer you know what 6-7 is. You don't have to be fucking 15 to know what 6-7 is. It's fucking work. Like it's, watch this. Do you know what chat UPT is? Good. Yes. I'd like to know the 10 things that are happening in popular culture that have popped off in the last month to anyone like urban culture, Hispanic culture, youth culture, women in the Midwest culture. Like what's happening in popular culture that is like new and exciting and a new potential trend in a year because I want to be ahead of it? I just asked that. Again, it's not about the tools. Every fucking person watching this knows what fucking chat UPT is. It's do you have the mindset, the strategy to put in the work? Here are two trends, right? Soft modern goth revival. Great. Soft goth is back. Good. Fucking a cowboy western revival reclaiming the look. AI co-creator, music artists, AI artists, recession pop, dance pop with emotional weight. Wonderful. I'm pumped that we have emotional weight fucking dance pop. I can't wait to dig the fuck in. You know, like it's just there's some post Instagram fashion runway that doesn't translate to the feed. Cultural hibernation like fucking it's all there everyone. We can all be brilliant at what's going on if we put in the work. All of this is about the work. How do I get more fit work and discipline? How do I build a business work and discipline? How do I have a great relationship? Work and discipline, work and discipline, work and discipline, work and discipline. Right, Conn. Ben, how'd you guys have your career? Work and discipline. Right? Thank you, Conner. Fuck. Keep it going. Let's keep it going. Okay. When trying to build my own software business, how should I go about understanding pain points of my customer's business? I've tried cold emailing and surveying, but I'm wondering if there are better options. Go live on platforms. Just you got to keep emailing. You got to email better questions. Just because you're cold emailing doesn't mean you're doing it well. Making content that asks people, like a video that says, what are your three pain points? I'm posting that on LinkedIn. Again, I had seven views when I did one on Ivory TV. 12 views. Like we've all seen the Mr. Beast video that is only, you know, like Kai said it, like everyone starts at the same place. People are just not, Aaron, people are just not willing to put in the work and be patient. They know the answers. Like it's just fucking consistency and trying different tactics if you've done something for months. And like, I don't know, people are just not willing to put in the work. It's like Pierre, right? Good athlete. He couldn't put in more work to his basketball game. He brings so much of his soccer skills. He's just so fucking athletic. But I know because I played with him, if you put in more basketball practice, he'd be even better. He's just going on pure athleticism. That's life. Like we have natural talents and the nurse work. I can tell you right now, my son, Xander in basketball, right, Ripscourt, you know this, he's put in the work to get better. It's not natural super athleticism. It's fucking work. It's fucking work. How do I transition from short form to long form content? Is there any specific equipment I need to be able to do that? Nope. I mean, there's no tools. It's understanding like there's a million tools. You could do it by hand. You could do it in Adobe. You could do it on Opus Clip. You could do it on... There's a million tools, literally, you know, ready? Hey, I want to go from long form to short form content. What are the best five tools out there? Absolutely. Shifting from long form to short form content can be really fun and impactful. A few cool approaches include focusing on punchy, attention-gramming hooks right at the beginning. No, I mean, I actually need the tools. I know the punchy hooks. I know the three seconds. I know the thumbnails. What are the best four tools to use to take long form to short form content? Here are the Opus Clip. Viddie, V-D-Y-O, dot A-I. ChopCast, pick Tori A-I, P-I-C-T-O-R-Y A-I. Friends, that's it. And they're gonna change. They're gonna constantly change. There's gonna be unlimited tools. With A-I now, there's gonna be unlimited tools. Tools are not the game. The discipline to use the tools are game. The weights, which weight should I use? They're all the fucking same. They're 15 fucking pounds. I don't care what fucking company you use the 15 pounds. It's fucking having the discipline to go to the fucking gym and fucking, you like this, Brad, Braden and Zach both like this answer. I don't give a fuck if you use manga or shmanga or fucking Goalie Pro or Pro this or fucking weight this or muscle yuck and ink. I don't give a fuck what your company's called. If it's 15 fucking pounds, it's 15 fucking pounds. It's the discipline to get the fuck up in the morning when it's raining out in New York, go to the gym and fucking lift the 15 pounds. It's not the fucking tool. It's the fucking mindset. It's the discipline. Fuck. Erin, next. Okay, this question has been asked a couple times in the chat from the Don. Started my Christmas light install business yesterday, waiting on a product to arrive. Any advice to help make this an awesome season of installs? Literally, literally Facebook content, Instagram content, pound meta. Meta is the alpha. Facebook and Instagram, Facebook and Instagram organic content, content, content, content, content, content, content, content, content, content. GaryVee.com slash attention if you wanna be good at it. Adrian, put it up. We can put the rareable thing down. GaryVee.com slash attention. Get rid of that little swiggy at the end. Edit that Adrian, thank you so much. If you wanna learn how to be good at it. What are the two most important traits you look for in an employee? This is from the chat as well. I don't know if there's two most important. You tried it, like it's hard when you, you know, I assume when you're hiring or after they are here. I mean, I think, I think buy-in, you know, I think buy-in's a huge part of the game, meaning I have a vision of the things I'm building, whether it's V-Friends, VaynerSports, Wine Library, VaynerX, Gary. I'm very empathetic that I have like a strategy. I don't think I'm right or wrong or brilliant or lost. You okay? Yeah, great. I just have a vision. And so what I'm really looking for is, do people really buy-in and understand? Buy-in and understanding matters. Because no matter how talented train will be, if I don't feel like he's bought in, he can only be so good. And that's why so many people move around in the company. Like some people go to Vayner to be friends or Team Gary to VaynerMedia or VaynerMedia to Team Gary. I'm agnostic if someone's bought into anything I do in any company, but it is the first requirement. And then after that, you're looking for, you know, I really care about someone's humanity, like how we all interact with each other. You know this, like with our team, we're so entrepreneurial. Like how do people deal with adversity? How do people deal with feedback? How do people deal with stress? I think mindset matters. And then I start caring about skill. So it's buy-in and humanity. And then I care about skill. Skill is a commodity. And it's about to become a huge fucking commodity. In fact, everybody who's been listening to me for 15 years about soft skills and emotional intelligence, you better get your therapy up because with AI, your fucking skills mean dick to me. It got real quiet in the up. Yeah. Like I'm serious though. I need everyone to buy in. EQ is about to eat up the oxygen of the world. Like so much of my team editing, filming, it's like, okay, cool. I'm gonna do that for nine cents. But if I feel like you're about that life, there's so much else to do. There's so much else to do. Hue, check this out. This is actually powerful. Humans. What are humans gonna do in this AI-scaled world? More human shit. We're not called processes. We're not processes. Rips, you're not a processity. You're a human. I'm gonna need more human shit from you. I don't know. You're not an informational list. Are you considered an informational list, Rips? No, you're considered a human being. I don't need information from you. I don't need processity from you. I need humanity from you. Humanity is at the tippy top of my list there. And it's about to really fucking matter. Teamwork, self-esteem versus insecurity, which always leads to less politics, all that stuff. And then self-awareness. The other thing I'm obsessed with is self-awareness. What are you good at? What are you not good at? What do you like? And then that leads to communication. A flaw of mine for a long time was I had all that, but communicating when it was tough was tough for me. And I now value that more and more and more in my older age. All right, let's go to the next question. Next question is from Louise. How do I set goals when we have an autistic child that consumes our life when we want to move forward? That's an incredibly challenging question. I mean, look, there's many families, many that I know, that have autistic children who have set goals. But first you have to calibrate your emotions. I don't know how recent this is or not. There's so much to this. And so it's tough for me to sit here and tell parents how to deal with such a real adversity. I would just tell her or him, please just give yourself some grace. Give yourself some time. Like you don't have to set goals. I don't know when this diagnosis happens. There could be three years into this. There could be three weeks into this. Just anybody who's dealing with adversity, the loss of a loved one, a diagnosis that's scary, dealing with a challenge like autism, just give yourself grace. We need way more grace. So many people, so many people judge themselves for how they handle adversity. And I ask people to give themselves more grace, especially people who are grieving a loss. The amount of people who think they can take like a couple of days off at work after their dad died, and everything should be back to normal. Look, for some people they can. Like they put it on a shelf to deal with it later. Some people are just so grateful the time they had, and that's their perspective. But other people, like it's just too tough. So I just, I ask all of you in every aspect of life, financial mistakes, there's some people right now devastated they bought a home because they ate up all their liquid and their cash flow is a problem and they're living to pay their mortgage and they're upset. Just give yourself grace. Life is long, life is long. Grace, graceful goldfish. Graceful goldfish is a very sneaky V friend, Rips. And I think we need to give ourselves more grace, more grace. How do you fight negative self-talk and limiting beliefs like I'm not good enough or why should people buy stuff from me due to not feeling ready? Because I myself am still on the way to learning what I want to teach. I really struggle with this because the reality is it's a self-esteem versus insecurity game. And I just don't understand how people don't understand that no one gives a shit and it's not high school. And like I get that people have voices in their mind. My voice says I'm good and I have good intent. Other people say I'm bad. Like I get that parenting, circumstance, DNA. The reality is it's all fake. Me being overly confident and other people being deeply insecure is actually fake. And I think once you get to that zen place of understanding that truth, it gets a lot better. And so I just, you know, honestly, I just, I really believe this is like the boogeyman and being scared of the dark and like all that stuff. And I just need people out of it. I'm 18 years old and I have these amazing music making skills. But my dad wants me to go to uni first and later do my music. My inner voice says focus on music. What should I do? Focus on music. Living your life for your dad is wrong. Like I do not understand how people understand this. Like living your life for other people is wrong. Look, uni is good if it doesn't collect debt because it's a lot of fun. And I highly recommend people going to that world if they want to. But at the end of the day, living your life for anyone, your dad, your mom, your cousin, it's always wrong if it's not for you. It's always wrong if it's not for you. All right, let's go to the next question. Next question is from Sally. If I'm a brand manager at a Fortune 500 company, how do I make the shift to becoming a pop culture strategist, aka a modern version of what a brand manager should be? Smart. The spending time. I mean, it's spending an hour, two or three on research every day. This is research trends, researching, reading, listening, watching, scrolling feeds, Reddit, chat, GPT, podcast charts, like consuming information as a human being. Aaron, next one. Okay, question from Johnny. Collecting has always been a thing, but how has social media changed its trajectory in the recent years? Social media has changed every trajectory of everything. It's given it more awareness, more shelf life. There weren't that many comic, excuse me, there weren't that many magazines, radio shows, and television shows that were giving collectibles a lot of attention in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. I think collectibles has been given a lot more awareness, so has so many other things. Unfortunately, including like crazy conspiracy theories, like other things have been given a lot of awareness too, and some good, some bad, but that's just life. That's the movement of the world we live in. Okay, this question is from Lori. How do you start a new business after 60 years old and challenged with technology? Very easily, start a business. Like 60 has nothing to do with anything, and technically challenged is the work, discipline, and work using, what's her name? Lori. Lori, download ChatGPT and ask every question that you're challenged by in technology to ChatGPT. No worries, another giveaway everybody, about $100 worth of value on this signed comic, in my opinion, on eBay. So even if you don't collect, just get it in the mail and make a hundred bucks. Next question, Erin. Okay, we're a B2B SaaS for car dealerships. We're trying everything right now when it comes to social. Should we keep doing that or dial into a theme? No, I think both work. I think you could be thematic for a while, you can be broad, but I think they're B2B SaaS for dealerships. Erin? Yes, dealerships, car dealerships. B2B SaaS? Yeah, that's what they said. Oh, this is a piece of cake. This is all about LinkedIn. Anybody who's selling SaaS products, please go to LinkedIn. Anybody who's selling SaaS products, please go to LinkedIn and treat LinkedIn the way you treat TikTok and Instagram and make content there. And then when you have some content that gets some views, let's say normally get eight views. I said eight, Erin, eight, but you get 400. Then run some ads against employees of car dealerships. You know, Babbo 323 on Twitch, welcome from France. All right, everybody, I'm gonna reset the stage again. I don't know if it's Chris or Courtney that's moving me to the screen share, but I'm gonna reset the stage again. Who in here, cause I know hundreds of you in here are VFriends collectors.
