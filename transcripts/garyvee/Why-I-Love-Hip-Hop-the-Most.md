You know why I love hip hop the most? Because people that are really in it, they work. Like I'm in corporate America. I'm in Silicon Valley. Actually that's why I fell in love with Silicon Valley. Those nerds, they worked like my hip hop friends did. I'm like wait a minute, these kids are coding at two in the morning, right? Like going to the studio last night in midtown at 12 and watching everybody work, they've used to work, he's working, they're working. Oh you were there with Young Berg and everybody? I was with Berg last night. Oh he was on the show with you, right? Yeah, like and you know why? It motivates me because in corporate America when I go sit with CMOs and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, they don't work like this, they're done at six. That's interesting though because you have the type of money that most rappers will probably be like, you know what, I'm gonna relax. Hip hop guys work so hard because that's probably their only opportunity to make anything. Like really, really make some money. The ones that are, by the way, corporate America, people are like that. Other people are like that. This is not a race or a genre thing. Most people wanna get to a certain place and they work to be able to enjoy and relax. There's a small group that works for the fucking game. I work for the game. I want all time legacy. I want people watching this in 2059. What's up Jeremiah? That's my great-great-grandson. You know like that's what I want. I want all time legacy. That's what I want. By the way, the reason I'm nice and giving away all my best content on Instagram and stuff, it's not because I'm Mother Teresa. It's because I want the leverage of being that guy. Do you think people should do, like, show them and talk about this, please?
