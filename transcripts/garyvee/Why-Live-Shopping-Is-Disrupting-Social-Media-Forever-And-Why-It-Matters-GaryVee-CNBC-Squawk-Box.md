Attention is the ultimate asset. These social platforms have the attention. We're gonna now shop in that environment. That's gonna affect media, that's gonna affect retail, and that's gonna affect the product services. There's no shot that meta, TikTok, YouTube, Google are not gonna be yelling and screaming about this. X will have this. This is too big, it's happened. So what's a live event? Is this different thing, QVC shopping? Not really. I mean, it's really, you know, when, this is the year, I mean, next year, this is gonna be a huge topic for everybody who watches this program and you'll be talking about this. It really is QVC on social. Other than the way the algorithms work in social now, when a person or a company goes live, they're gonna find audiences. The algo's gonna bring it to you. So obviously, QVC Home Shopping Network in the 80s, the consumer had to click and go there. The fact that I'm gonna be in my feed and then boom, there's a live shopping event and boom, the algo knows that I like t-shirts or vitamins or beauty and I get it, that's gonna be a big factor. Can I just say, like, you're gonna have to sell me on the live events because I already buy a lot of stuff on Instagram where it's a pretty effective ad. It's flashy, it shows me how it works. The video makes me think, yeah, I want this. I don't know if I want somebody talking at me saying, hey, buy this product, you've got this much time to do that. You know, sell me on this. Why do I need something more than what's already selling me on Instagram? Well, I don't really wanna sell you. It's been sold, meaning there are unbelievable amounts of people making over a million dollars a month already on TikTok live shopping. So it's not about commencing, it's about the commission. Those are vendors, those are essentially companies selling a million dollars. You're saying influencers are making a million dollars a month? Yes and yes, right? They have a product. Yes, as well to that. And hawking a product. Yes, to that as well. This is, look, this is going to be massive. But again, this is such a global platform. This has been going on for a decade in China. I've literally been... I've watched the stuff in China. I've literally been waiting for 10 years for this. Like there's videos of me in 2015 saying this is coming. It seems a little hokeyer than some of the flashy ads I already get that are really pretty well done. But I think you'll appreciate this. Some print, let's talk about it historically. What you're talking about is a print ad, in essence. It just happens to be in social. No, because of videos. You mean video files. This is a live version. Great, great. Because this usually shows me something about the product I want. That's video, so that's a commercial. If it's an image, that's print. And all this is, is QVC. It works. I can speak for myself. I have a Pokemon-like brand called V-Friends. We're doing live social shopping. I'm doing seven hours, ironically, today, about it. We sold... You're gonna be out for seven hours. I'm gonna be out from 12 to seven today on whatnot, which is one of the platforms that's emerging. And three Mondays ago, we sold $40,000 worth of t-shirts in two hours. Wow. That if I, and we're good at this, did my best social media non-live shopping advertising, we would have sold $3,000 worth. Okay. I'm convinced by numbers like that. We just did a shot from the mall, for Amos. I saw. Not a whole lot of people there. Is this why? What, 7.30 in the morning? Honestly, I was back there. I was like, that's a solid amount of people. No, but we used to do, like I've been doing this for a long time. It used to be the opening of 6am at 10am at 8am. Target, is there an investor play on this? Is there a way? And this is changing retail, but is this taken away from Target? Does it take it away from Walmart? I'm glad you brought this up. The reason I'm so excited to be here is every retail, every CPG. This is going to be over the next decade, a consumer package good. So if you're Proctor, if you're PepsiCo, I mean this is going to be a major deal, because don't forget, we have major channel conflict wars between the package good companies and the retailers. And the Amazons and the Walmarts are taking media dollars now, away from social. The overall impact to consumable products and to retail, of this dynamic and social shopping. And now the social networks taking an 8% rake on every transaction. I have six in some cases. But 8% and then a 3% process fee. But again, this is also going to hit Main Street. If you're a normal store in a small town in Jersey or California on Wednesday at 3pm, there is nothing going on. To your point, the retail traffic is changing. The fact that you can turn your little boutique into a studio now and go live shopping. Entrepreneurs can do this too. If you're a small business owner, you can get right out there. 10 years ago, I used to go on this program and others and talk about influencers is going to make money. And I got a little, huh. And now it's a multi-billion dollar economy. Is it undermined by the retailers? Is it undermined now? Yeah, I would argue that live social shopping is the only potential thing that Amazon should be worrying about in their domination. That's how big this could be. That's really amazing. And I guess who this is disrupting is traditional media who might have been pitching you these ads before. Yes, but it's also going to disrupt retail. Like this is another, don't forget, attention ultimately is the ultimate asset. These social platforms have the attention. We're going to now shop in that environment. That's going to affect media. That's going to affect retail. And that's going to affect the product services. Does the social media companies make money on this? Yes. So this is good for Twitter and good for maybe some of these other companies. There's no shot in 2025. I can't wait to come back in six to 12 months when this happens. There's no shot that meta, TikTok, YouTube, Google are not going to be yelling and screaming about this. X will have this. This is too big. It's happened. Who's the best at it so far? TikTok. And it's not imposed. Tell us the name of an influencer or two that you think have made a ton of money from this or are leading this. You know, it's funny. And what do they do to be so in front? So what I'm paying attention to more is the brand. So Mary Ruth Organics is a brand that's really doing this well. They're selling their vitamins. It's kind of a modern vitamin company. You saw, it was funny. I was talking to Mona and Dustin in the back. You showed the top three things that we're selling, right? T-shirts, vitamins and beauty. And I looked at them and said all three categories that are crushing right now on live social shopping. Avocombe and Fitch. I don't know if you're paying attention that they're getting a reboot. And then there's also, I think you guys covered this on, I don't know if specifically you, but Chili's, like the restaurant company, there was one TikTok. This is not live social shopping. This is just social. One TikTok that went viral that represented 40% of its Q3 growth. One TikTok that went viral. It was a triple cheese quesadilla. It wasn't even a limited time offer. Again, mango gummies, private label mango gummies from Walgreens, the ocean spray thing that was well covered. I'm telling you- We have to go, but I have to make a point. Please. It's just that one of the, what do you call it? Postmortems on the election. Yes. Was it the Trump administration understood TikTok in the way that Biden, the Trump campaign, in the way that Biden did. And I think what you're talking about now is investors need to understand it. The battleground on social will impact every single, every single stock on the market.
