## Transcript
The algorithms are the great opportunity of people and businesses in the history of communication. They are free. Newspaper ads were not free. PR companies to get you written about in articles were not free. Billboards were not free. Radio ads were not free. Television ads were definitely not fucking free. And now we have phones. It's not like it was in the 90s where you had a like higher up film production company and they came to your liquor store. Every fucking human starting at the age of six can take their fucking iPad or phone, produce a fucking video and post it on the biggest platforms that have attention in society for free. You talk about not taking money from parents, but what if they insist on helping you and almost don't let you do it any other way so you are stuck in there with them? So the only way around is to break completely free and cut the bonds. Is it worth it? Jimmy, you're a grown ass man. What do you talk about? Forcing you. What? Your mom rolls up on you, punches you in the head and stuffs dollars in your fucking pants, Jimmy. The fuck are you talking about? Forcing. I don't believe you. Mike, you like that? I got you, right? I don't know what else to do. I think you're probably laughing because you know my content so well. I'm not sure I've ever even said that. Like this drama that Jimmy's trying to paint us up like, no, no, Gary, guys, everyone, you don't get it. My parents are stuffing cash so into my body that my only option, I'm really stuck here. Like, I'm in trouble. Like, you don't understand, Gary. Here's what's happening. Let me just pull these out. Here we go. No, I just like you can do whatever the fuck you want. Like, Gary, you don't get it. Like, they're just, you know, they're drilling me with free money, just credit card, like just everywhere. Like, I can't and the only way to get through this barrage is I have to break free and never talk to my parents again. These awful humans who are drilling cash down my fucking throat and I, Gary, you don't get it. I can't stop it. The cash is too much and too aggressive and there's just no way. Jamie, you're fucking in control. And by the way, let me throw curveball to this little comedy skit. There are people who aggressively, as parents, try to push money down their kids' throat for one reason. They would like to parent their kids in perpetuity. They want to control every one of their decisions and they are manipulating you to be able to control your decisions by being your bank. That is true. Here's the problem. Every spoiled kid that I've met on earth and I've met many of them in this situation can just say no. When you say no, even if your parents are the most fucked up on earth and try to weaponize their money on you so that you pick the girl that they want you to marry, take the job that they want you to take, join the country club that they want you to join, even if they're the most fucked up parents on earth with obsession, with using money as the manipulating super tool. After their quick disappointment of, oh fuck, we can't control Jimmy, they'll actually respect you. How about that, Jimmy? I run a small B2B sales group. We literally go business to business sales. I do more telecommunications but I do more of the management. I hire, I manage, things of that nature. Would you be focusing solely on marketing the sole product itself, like the telecommunications or solely focusing on marketing my business as in recruiting and things of that nature? You need to do both, right? So I would market both. Okay. Right, at the end of the day when you're marketing, you're marketing with purpose, you would like something to happen. It sounds like you need both, right? Right. So for my dad's liquor store, he needs to sell wine and liquor and beer and food and we market all of those things. He also needs local employees so we may market locally to get employees. I think that people are obsessed with the word or in our society and the answer is always in the word and, right? So I think for you, the answer is and. Now, the reason I have an acronym called PAC at VaynerX, Platforms Algorithms Culture, is they rear their heads. In your world, if you're recruiting for people, LinkedIn might act differently as a P as a platform for you for what you're trying to do versus the way TikTok would work or Twitter versus YouTube. There's different audiences on different platforms for different reasons. Most people are in many platforms, but that's that, you know? Yes, because I know I was doing like a lot of recruitment through LinkedIn, like personally reaching out to people directly when I would see like their background saying, hey, you're good at marketing, I see you're in certain sales things of that nature. I would reach out to them personally and my team grew like tremendously rather than just traditional like recruit me with my recruiter. So as far as LinkedIn with more recruitment, should I be posting more of like more sales tips or more like what should I be posting more LinkedIn in order to engage more and send wanting people to work for my company? Yes. Okay. Stick with me. Do you understand what I just did there? Exactly. Yeah. Again, you're asking this is so how everyone thinks. You know what to post. Do you think you should put sales tips? Fuck yes, you should do sales tips. You're in sale. Fuck yeah. Like most people aren't asking me what they should do. Most people are asking me, how do I get lots of people to do sales tips? Lots of views for the posts that I do. Right. Right. You know you should be doing it. My question to you is, are you doing the things that you know I talk about? Are you posting 8, 10, 12 times a day or not? The answer is 99% of people are not. Cool. Okay. Well, thank you so much. It was super nice to meet you. I was like, wow, I've got on the call like, wow, hello. Hi. So thank you so much. Right. Before I let you go, did you understand? I do. I do understand. It's just that. Do you understand? It's like consistency. It's volume. The algorithms are the great opportunity of people and businesses in the history of communication. They are free. Newspaper ads were not free. PR companies to get you written about in articles were not free. Billboards were not free. Radio ads were not free. Television ads were definitely not fucking free. Direct mail was not free. This is why I was obsessed with email. Email in the 90s and today is free ish. You obviously have to get people on it. They're fucking free. And now we have phones. It's not like it was in the 90s where you had to like hire a film production company and they came to your liquor store and you made a video and they gave you a fucking VHS said you had to figure out how the fuck to do with what in that every fucking human starting at the age of six can take their fucking iPad or phone produce a fucking video and post it on the biggest platforms that have attention in society for free. Right. And I guess like my last question is how can I get people excited about sales? Right. Because people are excited about sales. Ring it. People are excited about sales. You can't convince people that are not excited about sales to be excited about sales. You need to just find the. Oh, I don't know. Hundreds of millions of people that are excited about sales. People. This is the problem with everyone. You're not going to convince me. Let me promise you something. You do not want someone on your sales team that you have to convince to get excited about sales. Sales are fucking DNA game. You are either fucking salesman or you are not. You're not convincing someone to be a fucking salesman. Right. Right. Brayden on my team. Great hair. Tremendous rebounder. Like fucking war course. Like country boy, boy strong and morals. Like would trust him with my children. Right. Like believe in him the most. Can't wait to see him dominate life for 60 years. But that motherfucker is not going on the sales team. Right. Right. Got it. OK. Absolutely. What a lot of people like you make the mistake of is you're trying to hit your saleswoman. Yes. Absolutely. And what you're misunderstanding as a saleswoman is the most important part of sales in sales. And this is not a common thing that is said, which is why it's misunderstood, which is why I'm beating this drum to the ground in sales. You cannot convince people. They are not good customers. If I convinced someone here who smokes weed that wine drinking is better and they're going to like it, I'm telling you nine out of ten of them will not be great customers. Even I'm great at sales. I can get all 10 to try. But I'm telling you nine out of ten of those people are not going to be great customers. They're going to do it because I sold them. You'll get salespeople because you sold them on sales a lot of times. And you know this, those people are fucking losers. Like like they're looking for and of course, people are not losers. I'm trying to say they're a losing sales player. They're searching for the next. Oh, Rainier looked dynamic. And you know this salespeople that are trying to sell and convince people to be in sales also suck at selling. They're showing watches and fucking trips. And you. Hey, you non salesperson. If you become a salesperson like me, you can have a fucking Bugatti too. Are you understand how how bad the people that are going to be excited about that are going to come to you because I'm a great fucking salesperson and I'm not falling for that dumb shit. Absolutely. Get that word commenced out of your fucking vocabulary. Find people that are already fucking salespeople. What strategy would you recommend for posting on social while keeping a somewhat low profile on my personal social media accounts while still employed in a corporate role? I literally do not post content that can be controversial or negative. I literally post nothing about my personal life. The end. Again, this is a game of you being in control. The end. You can like literally post anything you want. People post things. That. Really expose that they're actually addicted to the insecurities of the algorithm. People post their children. People post their personal relationships because they get more likes. And they compromise what's in their soul. And. They do it for something that is so not real. And it's a mistake for most people and ultimately rears its head. Luke asks, I work in finance, which I love, but I love singing and playing music. I'm twenty five. I'm nervous to even try it because I'm not sure I'm good enough. Pretty much no one makes it. No one listens to my stuff. Please help. I love your advice, man. This is a very simple question. Either you decide to live with regret or you don't. Right. Also, when you're twenty five, you have the capacity to do both. Like when you have that twenty five year old energy, you have twelve to eighteen hours a day to give to both. Gary, I think you're going to like this. Check this out. This is a great and different. I love nine out of ten. I love it. The king of five to a lot. And then I heard well. Wise wasp, great at ten. I got a whole I got twelve of them. I I I opened them on live the other day. I guess I'm real. It's these are those three D printed little things back there. Optimus Prime, all that. Yeah, yeah. It's cool. Yeah. How are you? Yes, I'm really well. Thank you so much. I listened to your content for years. I met you at the B Friends conference. The first one in Minneapolis. It was really cool. And you know, that conference was incredible. It really opened my eyes to just how big the crypto world is because it kind of gets their bad rap, but seeing like people do real shit was like super cool. But the reason I actually wanted to hop on here real quick with you is I'm 34. I paid off my mortgage through Sloan. Trading meme coins. I run a it's a tire shop that does seasonal stuff. So it's OK, Castle, but I'm also building a brand called Build Daily. It's all about discipline and compound and daily actions. And it's funny, I built a chat GBT model that is you. Like I trained it on all your content and I literally talk to try to get advice. So I ran this question through it and I want to see like how it compares to just go to it. So I got three three lanes right now, crypto, my tire shop. And then I built daily in my struggle is do I scale the real business? Because right now it's from home. Or do I go all in more on like the passions? Because I love being an entrepreneur. Like I cannot be an employee like like it. I just I can't you get like I cannot be an employee. But the tire business is kind of like it could grow, but almost like, man, I love all these side hustles. Like I feel like confused and like almost lost. Well, why? Why can't you do more? Because I feel like if you want to build like a real personal brand, say in like the crypto world, it takes so much time and energy that it pulls away a lot from like like well, how much time and energy do you put into work? Don't pull shimmy, Chris. How much time and energy every day do you put into work? In terms of like my passions, it's a lot like I'm up like seven am I go to bed like I'm in like I'm doing like ridiculous hours on like the side stuff. So it's it sounds like you're doing both. And you also know this, the meme coin thing worked out, but you could have gotten caught. 100 percent, which is why I'm trying to focus less on the speculative kind of gross side of things and build something. Correct. Again, back to my question. How much time do you spend on the tire business that has nice cash flow? As you call it, almost none. As you called it, as you called it the real business. Yeah, you did hear that, right? Yeah. Yeah. So let's let's let's focus on the subconscious of what your brain even thinks. Let's focus on the thing that you called the real business. Let's break this down. You have a real business that takes you very little time that has cash flow and is working. You've played highly speculative crypto behaviors. Thank God it worked out, as you know, for hundreds of millions. It did not work out. Yes. Correct. What do you think? Sounds like I need to focus on the real business. Well, I would say it sounds like you're giving it very little. It's kind of like relationships. Let me break this down for you. Let me paint you a very different picture. Over here on the left, you have this really reliable, wonderful, solid girl. She requires very little, you know, just, you know, even in fact, I'm mad at her because she should be asking for more, but she's happy with what she's getting and you're getting all the dividends of love. In fact, in this story, she's cooking dinner and doing right. And then over here, you've got a fucking stripper. Right. And you're addicted to the glitter and the fake tits. And it's all very exciting. And it worked out like this one time you hooked up. But what do you think is going to happen, brother? Yeah, when you put it that way, it's kind of mixed very clear. So here's like the one caveat I would just throw in there. Please. And like, like, I'm like, I love the honest brutality because that's. I'm wondering if chat Gary GPT gave you the stripper analogy. I'm going to I'm going to go with A.I.'s not there yet. No, it is not there yet. It told me to don't overthink it and just document and kind of just do my thing, which is kind of actually what I had like six, six different accounts for all my different passions. And I moved it all into my personal account, which is which has been good. The one caveat I would ask is like, I love running my business. I really enjoy that. But like doing the tire business, like the work itself, I don't necessarily am passionate about. But then is that just me being kind of a wimp? Like, you're not going to love everything you do. Like you sometimes just got to grind. Yeah, I mean, look, again, I want to have a logical conversation with you. I'm pumped that mean coin trading worked out for you. I'm also just like the reason I stay a theory and Bitcoin in the crypto world is, you know, I haven't done enough homework on the others. Like and I just feel comfortable that I understand the rails that Ethereum was building with Layer 2 and base and all this stuff. Obviously now that stable coins have been legalized by the Genius Act. It gives a lot of understanding to why a theorem's got a chance. Bitcoin, you know, money in the history of our time has always been does the collective believe it's money, right? Whether it's the dollar or coins or like gold and silver when cavemen were running around was gold and silver. It was in the fucking world, but people didn't value it. Consensus of humanity is important. Bitcoin is dangerously close, if not already, at consens of humanity. Definitely very different place than when I bought it for the first time in 2015, 16 big shout out to Aaron Battalion and South by Southwest Jam sessions for teaching me these things. I I just think that you gambled and it worked out and I have a I'm concerned to say like gambling is a consistent like gambling works once in a while, it's why it's gambling. It consistently does not work. Now, building a personal brand in crypto is a different thing, meaning I've I've got a personal brand in crypto. My belief is that one percent of NFTs on Ethereum will be the great collectibles of the next generation. And so I'm comfortable building out my V friends world and taking a real stab at trying to build Marvel, Pokemon, Disney. I believe in crypto punks. I think they've been proven to be very resilient. You know, they're a couple hundred thousand dollars for the cheapest one right now. And if these have sold hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two weeks at a time where ninety nine percent of the world thinks that they were a scam. That is a profound data point, which makes me bullish long term. Bitcoin is being eaten up by all the biggest financial institutions in the world. Literally, the CEOs and executives and boards of the biggest financial institutions in the world called it a scam a decade ago and now are running, writing substantial tens and hundreds of millions of dollar checks to get it. Those are black and white things that are happening. You know, buying vomit coin for point zero zero zero zero one cent, hoping an influencer tweets about it so you can sell it for point zero zero zero four cents doesn't feel like a sustainable model. Very true. What are you going to know? What are you going to? What are you going to build your personal brand on that? You so I thought you guessed on the app hype and it worked out or, you know, like that that you've got to be thoughtful about how you build this. So the way I'm doing it is you are you nailed everything you just said about like this slana stuff. So I thought like when I if I go in there with a totally different mindset and try to build something different. So like what is called it's built daily and it's just about like I bring a long term thinking to a short term game and showing. I think that's great. How are you going to monetize that? Well, this is a good question. I have a podcast and I'm hoping in time that, you know, get advertisements or what what have you. It's a hard game. I mean, I'm for it. If you can build a big enough audience, you can monetize. Here's what I would say. I think the way you're playing it right now is working. I like that you're happy, right? You're happy doing this other thing. I just want to make sure, A, that you're not gambling. B, if you're trying to build a personal brand and then do sponsorship against it, that's a regular business. By the way, no different than your tire business to your point. It's a lot more fun for you to play with the crypto stuff than the tire stuff. I'm fine with that. I would just tell you that in a world where you're 7 p.m. to 12 in the morning, you obviously are able to do that because you're enjoying the shit out of, you know, community, engaging Twitter, spaces, whatever you're doing to get into the space. It sounds like you just need to double down on both, meaning not more hours being more effective. You know, it's not about working more hours. It's it's, for example, my team around me, all of them. I think the second they get close to me and really look under the hood, they're like, oh, fuck, this guy works. Right. It's like, oh, he has 39 meetings every day, actually. And like 20 of them are 15 minutes and I take an hour and a half to do the same thing. Maybe I don't need an hour and a half. So if, you know, the tire business can get three times. What you're giving it by you being more efficient. And a lot of people that are that are playing in crypto or any other genre that plays out online, gaming, personal brands, live, social shopping, they end up spending all their time consuming the scroll instead of feeding the scroll. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's the big aha for a lot of people. I was excited to deliver that for you because I think it's going to resonate with you. Right. Your and listen, consuming is good. By the way, I actually consume a lot more than people realize. It's why I know shit. I'm constantly consuming, but I'm consuming with purpose. Right. Like I'm in my feed for like seven minutes and then I'm out. Like I don't derail. I know why I'm there. I'm not there to be fucking entertained. I'm there to know what the fuck the world is into right now. Get my latest New York Jets news and be the fuck out. Love it. No, that's what I needed here. I think that that's really put the nail nail on it at the end. Yeah, because what you realize is, oh, shit, Gary's right. If I just stop listening or watching. I've you know what the fuck you're consuming three hours a day of something that only took 30 minutes for you to grasp it. You're just using it for more entertainment and leisure than you realize in that two and a half hours that you save. Forty five minutes can go to working out and getting your body right. And the other fucking hour and forty five minutes can go to your fucking tire company, which, oh, by the way, will allow you the oxygen to continue to enjoy the process of the thing you like. What's more important experience or money? I'm a twenty four year old who asks myself this question quite often. I make great money for my age, but I don't know where to go from here. Both are good for different situations. Experience is always good. Money is often bad. Money exposes your truth. The amount of people that have made money and lost money, like made lots, lost lots is a lot because they weren't prepared to know what to do with it. Experience means you know what to do, no matter what it is, hanging a fucking picture on the wall. If you have experience in it, you will be better. Experience is dramatically more universal and more consistent than money. Money is a catalyst. The problem is it could be a catalyst for bad. If you are broken inside and you end up inheriting a million dollars from your grandma and you're like, yeah, my life is good now. You cannot comprehend how bad the next twenty four months are going to look. It is the story is oldest time. People consistently misunderstand how to use money. People consistently believe it is the great trick of our society. People are addicted to this concept that it's going to solve their problems. I've literally watched people get way worse when especially if they didn't earn their money, you know, as a real fucking loser, what playing when it comes to money? I saw I grew up with real fucking scumbag. It's and like dirt kids and like a lot of people were flawed. Do you know that between like fucking 11 and 25 in my life, the amount of kids and people around me that literally spent almost all their time trying to figure out how to fake an injury to collect insurance money? Yo, if you're from the dirt and the gutter like I am, please explain to everybody in the chat how common this conversation was amongst your other loser friends. Watch, watch a chat right now. People will tell you. Look, look at us. You see this? This is real below lower middle class life. If you grew up in this below lower middle class life. Again, I'm going to say it again. People don't believe me because they don't know me like that. Now I had a college 90 percent of the kids that I went to college with were on fucking financial aid and from real fucking ghetto life. Twenty four hours a day. Oh, what if I stop my car a little short and get hit in the back and then get a neck brace and collect insurance? Oh, look, a puddle. Let me slip like I'm being dead fucking serious. Money is going to solve my shit. Every kid that I watched play that game and I saw it. Look, every day was a hustle. Look, look, like people lived that life. Look, I'm an insurance adjuster. I see it all day. This is real shit. I'm telling you. And I've seen people collect on it and that money is gone within six months. Until you fucking get your fundamentals right internally. You have no shot. Go win the lot. Why do so many lotto winners lose? So I don't remember a question. But I know something. Experience is a hell of a lot better than money. Ty asks, I'm 36 and I'm starting over by going back to school. But in the past, I've struggled to complete what I start and I tend to lose interest easily. Do you have any advice for people like me? You just might not deal well with adversity. You might not have resilience. You might not have consistency. You might not enjoy the process of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. And so that might be the issue. Let me repeat this. You might have no resilience. You might not be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You may struggle with consistency. You may overvalue other people's opinions. You may have those issues. On the other hand, what you might have is very good self-awareness. And you just know that you thought something was good for you. And then you changed your mind, which I actually think is a tremendous strength. You're going to have to ask that question, either you're soft and insecure or you're self-aware and confident. I don't know. But I don't beat myself up when I don't finish tasks. When they're creative and on offense, I do beat myself up when I'm not doing things that are important, right? If I'm not spending enough time with my family, if I'm not going to the gym or eating well, these are very black and white things. You know, I don't view school as a black and white thing. There are too many people that are successful and happy that have not finished school. How do you love someone deeply without letting their negativity consume you? By limiting the time you have with them. Loving someone does not require you hanging out with them 24 seven. Right? Like I've been pretty consistent on this point of view, which is we must learn how to limit. Very seriously limit negativity when it is your life, even if it's your mom or spouse or best friend. And we must cut out negativity, complete cut out. If it's someone who literally has, you know, as an acquaintance, a co-worker, I think people confuse loving with enabling. I think this is super important. I think one of the biggest issues people have. And by the way, I've I'm a culprit of this. I think we enable bad behavior. And I think I think that that's something we have to be very, very real, you know, about. It's just real life. We also put words like loyalty on a pedestal. Again, being loyal to your toxic mom doesn't mean to sit and enable her toxic behavior. In fact, if you love someone, the actual requirement is to have candor with them and try to help them. I think that's the answer to the question. I think, again, we put things like loyalty and love and we disguise what we're actually doing, which is enabling. And we have to address that. And in life, like I always say life is fair and people get sometimes struggle with that. But of course, if lightning strikes you and you're dead, you know, one could be like, wow, that didn't seem fair. And I understand that. But I think a lot of people train. I'm fine with background. I'm prefer. I also think that what we don't understand is a lot of times we are manipulating and enabling the behavior that we get. And we blame others without being accountable to our own actions. There are plenty of people who are in narcissistic marriages who need to be honest with themselves to realize they are the enabler of the narcissistic behavior. And if they don't like it, they can force the candor. They can force the therapy or they can force the divorcing papers. They can do that shit. And and that is awfully hard and the hardest and the worst and all that. But again, in life, you either act or you complain and blame. And I just think living a life that is grounded in blaming and complaining is a very unhappy life.
