I've literally had CEOs of companies yell at me for 10 minutes about how bad social media was because it's put democracy on the brink of its knees. And then we would switch over to business and they would then explain to me how social media can't sell their product the way that print can. And I was like, let me get this straight. Social media is powerful enough to put democracy on its knees, but it can't sell lipstick? Get the hell out of here. I did trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life documented. You have one missed call from Gary Vaynerchuk, would you like to play the message? Why is organic social media the most important thing in business? Yet nobody's looking at it. Because everyone thinks it's an afterthought and a nice to have when it is the foundation of the competitors that are eating up the ecosystem. I'm writing a new book. It's called Day Trading Attention. And the thesis is we've never been in time in marketing in the last 100 years where you can steal it or you can get murdered. The reason I use day trading is there's two different ways to invest. You make different big bets and you go to sleep and you know that your grandkids are going to be happy or unhappy with you. Or you day trade and you're making it in the margins hour by hour. Marketing used to be the other way. Nine months, you know, we're going to plan the campaign and we're going to pray that it works out. And now it's, if you are not marketing every single day, someone's outflanking you. It's hard and I'm empathetic. The hardest thing in the world to do in marketing is social media creative. And yet it is deemed the easiest by every organization. And what I mean by that, I mean it's the thing that most people don't actually really care about. Marketers, business people, salespeople like ourselves, will go to a dinner table and we'll have conversations about social media on two fronts. One, how it's ruining the country. Two, how it's ruining our children. I've literally had CEOs of companies and they would yell at me for 10 minutes about how bad social media was because it's put democracy on the brink of its knees. And then we would switch over to business once we were done with our opening cocktail and letting that person ramp. And they would then explain to me how social media can't sell their product the way that print can. And I was like, let me get this straight. Social media is powerful enough to put democracy on its knees but it can't sell lipstick. Get the hell out of here. This is where you can outflag your competitors. Your direct competitors, the biggest companies, will take more seriously a 30 second commercial and spend more money on the catering of that 30 second commercial and the T&E of that 30 second commercial then they'll spend on their entire year on social which is why they're also reliant on influencers because they don't know how to do it. You becoming the influencer though is the Holy Grail. What I do for a living right now is try to get you to be in a place where you're not at the mercy of the influencer and not at the mercy of the celebrity and not at the mercy of the retailer. That is my obsession. And that's what needs to be your obsession. Otherwise, it's going to cost you more money to do business.
