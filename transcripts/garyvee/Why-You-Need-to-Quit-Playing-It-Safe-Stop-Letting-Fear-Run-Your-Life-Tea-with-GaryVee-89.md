## Transcript
Dude, I hate you. Recently started a business. $699 in West Texas? You need to quit your job. Are you out of your mind? If you quit and it fails, you can get another job being a marketing executive. Everybody's gonna have jobs. You do understand you can scale the f*** out of this. This is a big business. Come on! Good morning, nice and early on this Tuesday, post-Labor day, we are now transitioning. A lot of people are crying this morning. They love summer, summer, summertime and now we're getting to the nitty gritty. Others like me will wait to cry on Sunday because we're excited right now because it's football season. But somewhere around four o'clock on a Sunday is when us jet fans tend to start shedding some tears. Hopefully tears of joy after beating Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers, but we'll see. Great to see everybody. Let's go to Noel, who's on video. Hey, what's up Gary? My brother, how are you? Where are you from? Paris, France. Very nice, pleasure. Thanks, I've been following you since 10 years now, so good to talk to you. Thank you so much, I'm humbled. So the thing is, I'm a professional photographer since like five years now. So I had a job and everything. I was doing this on the side, so I was grinding. The five years went pretty well for now, but this year is not as good as the other. And I feel like I've reached a glass ceiling, and I don't know what can I do now. Like I keep producing content, so I'm into fashion, design and stuff like that. And so I keep producing. When you say a ceiling in booking jobs and making revenue, what do you refer as a ceiling? Yeah, yeah, yeah, like having jobs, revenue and stuff like that, definitely. And where I want to be. Where do you want to be? Like shooting big campaigns, stuff like that. Like in my aesthetic, you know? Yeah, so I assume for Gucci and Dior and like big fashion brands, is that what we're talking about? Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. If I'm you, I'm sending messages on LinkedIn to the CMO, Chief Marketing Officer, of the 500 biggest fashion brands in the world. I literally grab a nice glass of French wine. I sit down, I go on LinkedIn, and I literally direct message. There was a hedge fund today that bought a lot of equity in PepsiCo. I think they bought $4 billion worth of PepsiCo. Pepsi's a big client of ours. Literally already this morning, it's 7.40 in the morning, I am looking up the LinkedIn of the partners of the hedge fund. Definitely, that's what I'm doing right now. I mean, I'm DMing and I'm lending all people. Hold on, hold on, how many? No, no, no, I need to double click. Thank you for your big smile. Exactly. Here's the thing, when people want big goals, they have to do big things. I'm actually talking about you sending a message on LinkedIn to seven top marketing executives at Gucci, then BMW, then Mercedes, then Jaguar, then Rolex. I'm talking about you sending a message to somewhere between 3,000 to 4,000 people on LinkedIn, not sending six DMs on Instagram to the account of Dior. Yeah, no, sure. Yeah, definitely, I'm targeting the right people, but I think I'm definitely not DMing enough. It's the same thing, it's kind of like anything. When you took your first photo, were you as good as the photos you're taking now? Of course not, it was experience, right? When I did my first push-ups with Mike 11 years ago, and I started getting my health done, I did eight bad push-ups, that's how weak I was, truly. I did eight bad push-ups, I had never worked out of my life, I didn't have muscles, I was overweight, it was hard. They were bad, I didn't know the form, my left shoulder didn't even know how to close its fucking shoulder blade, it was fucked up. Today, I bang them out all day long, proper form, like a fucking real player, why? Because I did 11 years of the work every day, every day, every day, I didn't wanna wake up at 6.13 this morning, I didn't want to, but I'm trying to make sure I'm in physical shape, same thing for business. I just think it's a, my biggest observation, especially as I'm bringing back tea with Gary V, is people don't realize the sheer volume of the act. They're like, Gary, I do do it, I do post, I'm like, no you don't. I have 25 employees and testing and posting all day long, that's different than posting one on your grid every four days, because you aesthetically wanted to look good. Just a different game, and I just think that if you want to get bigger jobs, it's called networking. The easiest way to network is digitally. You're allowed to go to cocktail parties, you're allowed to show up to places where there's PR people that might invite you to PR parties where you can literally network and rub elbows, but in the 70s and 80s, it took seven years because someone had to go out every night to trend these spots and meet people and hope and pray. Now we could just take that shit on social media. Right, you can go to chat, GBT, and say, give me the Instagram of the 50 biggest creative directors in the world, give me a link to it, it gives you links, you click it, you direct message, I'm here, some of my work, but then there's 4,000 people sending direct messages to these people with their work. So can you actually spend eight minutes looking at their profile, realizing that they like champagne or race cars or Bravo reality TV so that you could send them a different kind of message? You understand where I'm going? Completely, I've been doing that, not enough I guess, but I've been doing that. And I just have another question following that. It's like I have some of these people in my network, some of them are following me, like being like an international marketing manager at John Paul Goutier stuff, like they've been following me on Instagram. So yesterday I was DMing them like, oh, it's been a long time, like you've been following me, let's start, I hope we can work someday. Stop right there, stop right there. If I'm you, I don't say I hope we can work someday. You showed your card. I would just say, hey, let's grab a meal and talk about creativity, right? If for me, when I'm direct messaging people, I never go in for the clues within the first conversation because at some level, I'm too empathetic for the other person, everyone's asking them for what you just asked them for. But if I go look at their last three posts or 10 posts and see that they posted about helicopters or aesthetics that they're saying pastels are coming back, I write them back and be like, yo, I totally agree with you with pastels. I see, like, I'm trying to build a little bit of a relationship to get to the cocktail. You know, to me, I'm respectful above the other person's time. Hey, do you have 15 minutes? A lot of times I'll say, do you have 15 minutes for a coffee before a dinner? Would love to talk to you about creativity or fashion or design. You see where I'm going? It's not just putting in the, back to working out. It's a lot of people, now that I know how to work out properly because my trainers have always been very big on form, not on the pizzazz of being in the gym. Like, I go to a gym now, once at a blue moon, if I go to a public gym when I'm traveling, like watching dudes like swing their whole body just to get their curls up because they want 10 extra pounds for the vanity versus me being willing to do five pounds less to get the actual proper form, now what you and I are doing is we're talking form. You know, I'm giving you the nuance within the action. You see what I'm going? So maybe it's your form that needs a tweak. Get your volume up and get your form up and you're gonna see massive results. Make sense? Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense. Definitely, I will change the way I'm reading to people. I would also reach out to small podcasts around photography and fashion and design and aesthetics. Very small ones that will definitely take you as a guest for two reasons. It gives you an opportunity to like really go deep for 45 minutes, plus you can clip the video clips from your long form and use it for social. It might be good content for you because when someone's asking you questions, they're making you think about things that you haven't thought about yourself. Yeah, definitely. I've been giving people in my DMs like wanting to interview me and stuff and I didn't reply yet. And is that because you think, and this makes sense to me, do you think they're too small and you don't wanna do small shows because it'll make you seem smaller and you're waiting for bigger shows? Yeah, it makes sense, brother, it makes sense. I get it, brother, I see it every day, yet I still will do small shows now and I got to big shows by doing small shows. Yeah, definitely. Like, you know, everybody's so over-worried about optics, especially for someone who's in design, aesthetics, like even you on screen, everyone's like, I love the glasses, I love the hat, I love the rings, like you are in a visual aesthetic world. I respect that to no end, but I promise you very little happens in the world without action. And having humility against your action is always a competitive advantage. Makes sense. The person in your circle that's gonna break out and get to the next level is the person amongst those seven to 10 of you that are the same, that's willing to take the judgment of the other six or seven of you while you do things that are smaller than what the six or seven of you think you should be doing. Definitely, I totally agree with that. Humility is a secret weapon, brother, I promise it is. And it's an incredibly rare weapon of choice these days. It is, okay. Yeah, makes sense, makes sense. But you know, just one thing, because you know, like when I watch, I'm seeing like people who are watching my stories and stuff, or when I'm looking out for people in production or in agency and stuff like that, some of the time I always like see the profile of the, I don't know, like the production manager or the director of the agency, they've been following me and I'm like, look, why do they follow me? If you know, like since, I don't know, like two years of the- They're following 37 other people. Yeah, sure, yeah. You know, it's just serendipity, you know? Don't worry about what they're thinking. I don't, brother, I don't spend one second worrying about what people think. Yeah, true, that's true. I'm not worried about why they're following me, why they're not. Do you know how many people spend a week thinking about why someone unfollowed them? Pablo, don't I have like 4,000 people unfollowing me like every day or something like that? Some like stagger, right? Thank God it's like 6,000, but like, I mean, I just don't want to be like, I mean, just don't worry about why the fuck they are or aren't. Yeah, sure. It doesn't fucking matter. What you're doing, brother, is classic. You're clearly good, like I feel that. And but what you're doing is you're waiting for it to come to you. It has been like that like, that the kind of the five years like- Yeah. You know, they, it's- You know why? You know why? It's being like that. That's a fancy move. You're too fancy. I need you to get some dirt under those pretty fingernails. Yeah, you're right. You're too fancy, my guy. Yeah, you're right, you're right. And I'm gonna tell you something about fancy. Nobody gives a fuck. The only people that care about fancy are other insecure fancy people. Yeah, you're right. I know, brother, I've lived. I'm like, you know, I'm only months away. We're now in the fall. Like I'm months away from being 50. I've lived a half century. I knew it when I was 16. I definitely know it at fucking 49 on the way to 50. You're impressing or worrying about impressing people that are stuck too. Big announcement. As you've probably heard at this point, because I had John from Stan on the show, I'm an investor advisor to an incredible startup called stan.store. I'm sending you right now to garyv.com, garyvie.com slash stan. Go check this out. We've done a garyvie stan.store challenge, which actually has a weekly call with me. This is built for everyone who's been affected, honestly, by my overall content. The tech stack, all these features and the minimal costs per month that stan.store has built is really the tool that was needed for this world that I envisioned when I wrote Crush It, when I wrote Crushing It. And this overall thing I'm thinking a lot about lately, which is the individual empire, right? This creator entrepreneur slash entrepreneur creator economy that I think is gonna eat up the oxygen, very honestly. The thing that so many of you want in your life and the reason so many of you are not there yet is you've got the strategy for me. You've got the ambition within yourself, but you don't have the tools for you to fully maximize it. And I believe you can find that at stan.store, stan.store, but specifically, I want you to sign up for it through my challenge because I wanna get access with you and plus there's a bunch of cool things. So if you wanna go see those cool things, go to GaryVee.com slash stan, S-T-A-N, now. You wanna build a bigger business. You wanna make more for your family. You wanna make more for yourself. Nobody give, like, when you're 73, nobody's gonna give a fuck that you got invited to the fucking off-white party during Fashion Week. Who gives a fuck? Sure. You know? So- But it's a good reminder. Yeah, because it's your currency. It's your currency in your circles who gets to the Louis Vuitton party matters. Meanwhile, it's a party full of completely insecure people who are running to the bathroom to do cocaine because they're socially insecure about everyone's opinions that they have to do drugs. That's a fucking crew. Like, right? Thank you. Right? Like, they're so worried about judgment. Am I number 17 in this room or am I number 31? That girl's prettier than me. Like, literally supermodels in stalls in the bathroom doing drugs because they subjectively decided one girl in the whole place is prettier than them. That's not life, bro. That sucks. And by the way, when you're 49, you're not that pretty anymore by those standards. And what are you gonna do with the rest of your life if that's your value? And then you got dudes in there literally wearing 47, like a diarrhea of brands on them. Because they're so insecure. They want girls to like them and that they have to literally become a fucking billboard of wealth because they don't believe they're worth it without the money. I mean, what are we doing out here? So bro, go fucking humble yourself and start attacking. Start having meetings with people early, late, in between running around all of fucking Paris, meeting people on their way up. Don't go for the top dog. Go for the intern. Because the intern's gonna be the top dog in seven years. And you're gonna have to kiss 30 frogs. I've taken 40,000 meetings that have a mass to nothing. But there's 137 in there that I had meetings with people that they really appreciated and now they run the biggest companies in the world. Now what? All you have to do is be 137 out of 41,000. But most people don't have the stomach to do the 41,000 because most people think they're better than that. No, that's a good reminder. I was like at the beginning and I guess I lost that along the way. That, I love you for that. I don't know how much you consume of me, but it sounds 10 years, you've probably heard this. You know how I always say, I say this a lot, you just got to this part and now you think you have to do something different but what you actually have to do is double down on the shit that got you to this part. That's the fucking thing. That's who I am. I worked yesterday on V-Friends. Yesterday, people out here crying that they want to be more successful. People crying that they want to be 1% successful of what I am and they're fucking chilling yesterday. And by the way, you need to chill in all this but I'm just saying, I'm not saying I'm better than, I'm not saying that was good or bad or indifferent. Like it might've been bad. Maybe I should've been chilling with the fam. Like I don't know, but like I'm just telling you, I did work. That did happen. You know, like, I can't sit out here and say I'm building the next Pokemon and be doing a keg stand yesterday. Do you know how much I hate Bill Belichick? I wanted to watch TCU in North Carolina. I wanted to watch him lose because I knew he was going to lose but I couldn't because I had to fucking do some shit for V-Friends because it's building and I'm building it. So anyway, love you, bro. That was really good. Thank you for that. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Gary. All right, everybody. Next question. The Trendsetter Music guy asked, can I ask what your opinion is on meta ads and social media ads spent for music artists trying to get discovered in the modern music industry? That you need to post organic first and when you have something that pops organic, then you spend media dollars on it. Just like Pablo, back to working yesterday? Was it yesterday when I was like, yeah, yesterday, I told Pablo, the lovely young man who's asking me questions right now. I'm like, here's a piece of content that crushed for me. This is yesterday. Please spend ad dollars against 30 to 45 year old female entrepreneurs because I thought it would hit for that demo. So I'm a big believer in running ads after the content won organically, not before. Got it? Paul Garza, what's good? Where are you from? What's your question? I am from West Texas, so that's a Texas. So I'm 34 years old. I actually just recently started a garage clean out business. We go and clean people's garages out and then we buy the stuff they don't want and we're trying to resell. I work at Brunei. Bro, Paul, I swear on my children's health. I wish I was running this business. That is like my, you just literally described my dream life. Go and eat shit and clean shit. And I'm not scared of anything. I'll walk in dead rodent. I'll pick that shit up with my hands and not wash my hands for a week. I'm not scared of shit, court. That's just unsanitary. That should happen too. I don't give a fuck if it's unsanitary. And, and what, court? I will let him talk. Let me just finish my excitement. And then to find, like if I fucking clean out some dirty, dirty fucking garage and then on top of it, I find some He-Man figures in the corner. Oh shit. All right, go ahead, Paul. No, so we're working through some bottlenecks of trying to get stuff sold out. We're trying what not. We're doing Facebook marketplace. It's going, it's slow. Where I, I'm in an interesting place right now is I also have a full-time job. I'm a marketing director. So I work, you know, eight in the morning. I'm six in the morning really, if you count taking my kids to work or to school. And, and then it's five to whenever to try and get stuff sold. And then we're mostly cleaning stuff on in the weekends right now. Makes sense. So I think it's a process of going through and trying to build that out. I think the biggest thing that question I have is that at what point or what kind of indicators do you look for for like, yes, this works. This is going to be something that I can do full-time. Makes sense. You're asking the right question. Watch this. Have you, Paul, have you heard about the concept of common sense? Yes. Good, let's play common sense game. I'm ready. Can I get some music for the common sense game? This could be an ongoing thing. I'm like, it's time, like, like we got to make a little thing. Like maybe make an AI song with me where I'm like rapping like comments. Like, I think it's like time for the common sense. It's like, price is right. Common sense game. Common sense game. Common sense game. Common sense game. All right, good. It's time for the common sense game with Paul from West Texas. All right, Paul. Question number one in the common sense game. Have you been able to get customers? Yes. How much are they paying you to clean a garage? $699. $699? Yes, sir. You need to quit your fucking job. Are you out of your fucking mind? What? $699? I would do it for $69. And that wasn't a high school joke. Paul, you're getting paid. 700, yes, sir. What? Yep. And how many, I mean, let's go to the next question, even though the game's over. How many garages have you cleaned? We've done 16 so far. We're only about a month in. Paul, you're an asshole. Paul, you're a fucking asshole. You have an enormous business. Do you know how many fucking people in West Texas would clean garages for $3 an hour under the table? You just need to build the infrastructure. Let's go. How'd you get the 16? Facebook. Bro, because you know how to do the marketing, you know I'm right about this Facebook local ads thing. You know I'm right. And you also know that people are lazy or incapable or prefer like me. I'm not lazy, but I'd rather pay for something I don't wanna do. I'll happily pay 700, but I'm rich as fuck. I have no idea why people are paying 700. $699, Paul? Yeah, yeah. We have a longer portion. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Go ahead. Here's the best part. Question three in the Common Sense Game. Play the music. The Common Sense Game. Common Sense Game. The Common Sense Game. All right, back at Paul. Question number three in the Common Sense Game. Have you found any expensive worthwhile stuff in any of these 16 garages? We found a furniture. I found some $600 baseball gloves. I mean, yeah, there's some good stuff. You are a straight fucking Paul. I hate you. I hate you. I also broke these, but that's good because these are broken anyway. Paul, I hate you. Bro, what are you talking about? Quit your fucking job now. I think it's just, it's the security that scares me because I've got three kids. Paul, you can get another job if this fails. You're doing this for like three hours, dominating. You'll be able to sell the shit on what not eBay, Facebook, Marketplace. If you had time, you don't have fucking time. Yeah. Yeah. $700. $200? I'm afraid you didn't say that. Yeah. Yeah. Is the wife hearing this? No, she's not here. I'm sure she'll love to watch this later. Is anyone hearing this? Yeah, I've got my coworkers here at the job I'm talking about, leave. They should quit too, Paul. I mean, this is- They should quit too. You're a hirest bitch, Dad. Paul, if you quit and it fails, you can get another job being a marketing executive. Everybody's gonna have jobs. Don't let this AI thing scare you. I could even just tail by your temperament. Just talking to you for five minutes. By the way, this is how I hire people. Just five minutes, I could tell that you can get another. By the way, I'm gonna make a prediction. If your garage thing fails, and you have to go back in the market, and you're like there, it's that night, right? You're laying in bed, and you're like, play the music. Like this is playing, right? You're thinking about this moment. All right, turn it off. And you're laying there, you're hearing the music, and you go, man, fuck Gary Vee, right? If that's the moment you're in, right? Sure. Let me tell you what's gonna happen the next day. You're gonna get a job that pays you more than what you're getting paid now. Yeah, yeah, it's just, it's fear. You're 100% right. You've sold, did you see my fucking face? $699? Yeah. In West Texas? Yeah, yeah, we got oil money. I know you do, that's fair, but still, man. That's Manhattan prices. Damn it, I was afraid you were gonna say all that, but I think I knew it was coming. Here's what you do. You go ham now on your ads and get bookings for like another hundred, right? You position the ads as, hey, we're taking, this has been massively successful. We're taking clients for November and December. You see what I'm doing? Yeah, yeah. Then you push that as hard as you fucking can, and then you see that if you actually get three, 400 bookings, then you actually get all those people around you right now to quit, and you guys go hard. Yeah, yeah. Got it? You frontload it. You frontload the demand. Create the security that you're looking for, but the real security for you, I gave you, which is you can get another job. Now I'm gonna really stun you. I'm gonna whisper, even though the hot mic is hot mic-y, I'm just gonna go in for it, including maybe this job. Because if you're actually decent, they'll take you back. Sometimes for an increase. Yeah, yeah, that's happened once before, actually. Oh, dude! Dude! Come on, Paul! Yeah, I know. I hate you! Oh, I love you, Gary. I love you too, you know I'm joking. And this whole business model was based around a lot of the stuff that I've been seeing you do. No shit, Paul! Yeah, no kidding! It's pretty fucking awesome. No fucking kidding, Paul! Sorry. Paul, I'm gonna kill you if I check up on you in a week and you're not doing this. Like, kill you, like, you're dead. Okay. Do you want your children to be fatherless? No, God, no. Okay, so come on, man. Are you fucking $699? And you get their stuff? Yeah. A little area of Lex, Texas, you do understand you could scale the fuck into this. You do know like kids built up that 1-800 junk pick up. Like, this is a big business. Yeah, yeah, and even in just West Texas, there's several towns just outside Lubbock, Amarillo, San Angelo, Abilene. No one has any competition to what we're doing. So there's plenty of room for that for sure. I think it's just, well, like I said, we're a month in, so the fear is just, okay, this is working so damn well. Is it just a fever dream? Is this just kind of a fluke? That's my concern, you know? I know what your concern is. It's what everyone's concern is. For some reason, when people see good, they're like, oh, this can't be, but when they see bad, they're like, that's true. You guys are all fucked up out here. Literally, you believe negativity blindly. Like, oh, the neighbor's stealing. Yeah, the neighbor's stealing. But, oh my God, I've proven to myself I have a real business. Nah, that can't be real. It's too good to be true. Motherfucker, it happened. The other shit is hearsay. Yep, I'm with you. Damn it, yeah, I'm with you. AI's gonna take my job one day in 97 years. I better fucking stress about it every minute. Over here, I'm fucking selling garage cleaning for 700 bucks all day long. I even started spending ad money. There's nobody else doing it, and we get their free shit. Let me cry that I don't know how to sell the free shit fast enough. You fucking asshole, come on, Paul. You're right, you're right. I go up right. I appreciate this so much. This was, I needed this. Good man, I'm happy to give it to you. I love you, bro. I'm so fucking proud of you. Go hard as fuck. You clearly know what to do with the Facebook ads. I know it will work. I know it will work, which is why you were able to piece it. I'm proud of you. Like, I've literally pieced this together. I have told people to do this at scale. You actually put it together without me fully saying do this exact thing, which is like, I'm a very big fan of like get you to the water, but I need you to drink, because if I tell you to do it exactly, you're gonna lose, like too many people will do it and lose and like I don't wanna get it muddied. You listened, put it together, have the marketing background to know how to make good ads. I'm giving you some insights. I had a future sell, give you, you know, like it's there, bro. Right, yeah. I'm excited, but yeah, I'm with you. Bro, you can get another job. If it makes you feel better, let me give you another thing to like triple down on your fear. While you're building this 60, 70, 80 hours a day, a week, excuse me, you can interview for other jobs once a week for 30 minutes on Zoom or physically. Yeah. Just to have it there. I think you just need peace. I just think that you need peace of mind. I think it's, so the little backstory, I mean, I think what hurt me a lot, what's going on in my head right now is, I had a marketing agency, I was running pre-COVID, and we had a lot of oil-filled companies that were on and COVID-19. I'm stopping you. That you were running a company versus a job. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's just the fear of going back to... Entrepreneurship. And then going to zero. Because it's different now. I was in my 20s, I had no kids, I had no responsibilities, and so it feels different. Of course it feels different. You're scared. You got the kids, you know? Yeah, you got the kids. How old are the kids? One, three, and six now. I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of that. You're six, three, and one-year-old don't need that much, bro. Yeah. Your six-year-old does not need to go to fucking kindergarten in a pair of fucking Air Jordans. You know, you're hitting on something that's gonna be an interesting, more psychological thing here for me, because for me, I'm okay eating shit. I'm fine with it. I'm pulling fucking rats out of a garage. I don't mind that side of it. I could move back into a cardboard box if I wanted to. Right, so what you're doing is you wanna decide to ruin your kid's life by making them entitled and soft and trust-fun babies. So you don't wanna do this, which will actually ironically get you more success, but you don't wanna do this because of the ideology of going right down the path of what the last 30 years of bad parenting has looked at. So almost, it's not me I'm concerned about. It's a wife conversation. Oh, I know what, no shit, dickface. Yeah. And? It's one, yeah, no, yeah, I don't know, and that's it. I mean, that's the biggest, it's taking the step back. Is she? Me taking the step back is okay. I don't know if she will be okay with it. What is she gonna lose out on? You know, the nice house, the nice car. Well, hold on, you haven't sold the Couser car yet. Not, no, no, it's the fear of taking the step back. Is she telling you not to do this? No, no, she's been supportive. She's been definitely supportive of this. Yeah, so it sounds like you're imposing on her your ideology. Sounds like you're scapegoating her on your own fear. Maybe a little bit, yeah. What do you mean maybe a little bit? You just said she's fully supportive. Paul, you're the worst. She's supportive of this because I have a full time job. Paul, you're the worst, Paul. What do you mean? Yeah, yeah, I'm an asshole, I know, I know. Shit. But you're capable, what's pissing me off. If you were a loser, I wouldn't be saying this. I'd be like, stay with the job, dude. You know what I mean? That's the worst part. Okay. You're the best version of a loser. You're a winner. Yeah. That's putting on loser makeup. Yeah, I miss that in my 20s, not giving a shit and just going and it works so well for me. I don't know, the kids, the kids, fuck with me, yeah. What do you mean the kids? The kids have no fucking idea what the fuck you're talking about, Paul. They don't, they don't. What do you mean the kids? Giving them, you know, yeah. No, no, here's what actually happened. Instead of blaming the kids who have no fucking, the one year old's shitting his pants right now, literally as we speak, your one year old is shitting their pants. So is the three year old probably by the way. And if the six year olds like me, they're pissing their pants, all right? So you've got a six year old pissing their pants, a three year old's shitting their pants and a one year old's shitting their pants, okay? They don't know anything. You have a wife who's fully supportive. Here's what actually happened. You took a loss during COVID and you've not been able to realize that was a good thing, you've decided it's a bad thing. It's you, bro. Yeah. It's not baby mama. It's definitely not the three Munchkins. It's fucking you. Yep, I think that's a lot. Bro, it's actually wonderful, bro. Like I'm proud of you, man. This is fucking phenomenal. First of all, you've done a couple things. One, you've just helped a ton of people. How many people see themselves in Paul and don't be full of shit because you wanna be a winner and associate with Paul because he's clearly a winner? Like don't say that because not all of you are Paul but some of you are Paul. You're winners putting on loser makeup. So you see what's happening, Paul? Like, you know what I mean? First of all, you're helping people because you had the courage to come up here and do this with me. Bro, 699. Yeah. You could always get another job. You do understand that, right? No, 100%. I mean, I've had multiple jobs over the years. Of course, yeah. Paul, you do realize that there's other places to live besides West Texas and America, right? God damn it, yeah, I know. I fucking know. So you're gonna say to me, like I'm trying to go through every angle of what your loser makeup is trying to send you down. Oh, but Gary, if I give up this one, this is the best agency in the area. So if I have to come back and they don't give me a job, I can't get it. Well, then go to fucking Houston, asshole. Oh, but like my wife likes this house. I'm like, get another nice house. Like, I don't know, get the fuck out of Texas and go to Arkansas, I can get a better house. Yeah. Paul, a lot of people wanna connect with you from the chat. How do people find you? What's your Instagram? Do you have an Instagram for this company? What do you do? Cause you're running ads. I would love if everybody could find me on what not and Facebook reclaimed, be honest with you. A lot of the other stuff I haven't quite gotten into, it's Facebook and what not. What not's reclaimed one. Facebook. Hold on, hold on, slow it down. Reclaimed one as an O and E or the number one? The digit, the digit. Okay. Oh, without the E. Reclaimed one, right? Yep. People are, Adrian just tagged you. Is that right on the screen? I can't see it from where I'm at. Well, figure it out. Reagan's gonna look it up. I got a staff here. See? You figured it out. It's very emotional. Does that look right? Yeah, I believe that's right. Great. Anybody can DM him. Paul, you can do this. Yeah. I appreciate it. I just need to get past. Yep, that's it. Yeah, no, I appreciate it. I think it's a lot of, you're right. It's a lot of my own insecurities I need to get past. Bro, what you are doing is very common. You took a macro or I wouldn't say a macro, but definitely not a micro. You took a medium L and you've allowed it to consume you. Yeah. No, yeah, it fucked me up hard. Makes sense. It's real hard. But I don't know if you know about this. Put it on the common sense. Watch this. Common sense time. Common sense time. Common sense time. Oh, let's go. Common sense. Common sense. All right, turn it off. Paul, you got fucked. Stay with me here. By a once in a century pandemic. Yeah. Paul, a once in a century. Pandemic. Not because you were taking your money and going to Vegas and putting it on black. Not because you're delusional and you over hired. Not because you fucking, you know, got high in your supply and just started getting lazy and someone else came up underneath you and got you. You literally got thrown off by a once in a century pandemic, which is what? And there was people on the flip side. Some people exploded during a once in a century pandemic and they decided they were somebody and now they're eating shit today. It was a, from a common sense standpoint, a once in a generation, once in two generation moment. And you've decided to give it so much validity. Yeah. I think I just thought I was hot shit back there and I thought I could do it. You know, and when I did it, yeah. I think you are hot shit. I'm glad you took that L at such a young age because now you're more prepared to build a monster company. Yeah. And you've learned to never think you're hot shit. Bro, the fuck are you thinking you're hot shit for? I think I'm dog shit. That's why I'm picking up rats and not washing my hands. I'll eat the dead rat, Court. In your face. In your face, Court. I think I've just got to get to an in-between of where I feel about myself now and what I used to. That sounds nice. I think it's a nice balance I need to get back to. Don't get to 50%, get to 73%. I like that. I love that. You know what's so funny for me? Opinion B or option B or I can't read it, says no, you won't. People don't know me. I'm fucking crazy. That's why I'm so dangerous. The reason I'm so dangerous, the reason I'm out here publicly selling love and optimism when the whole world doesn't want me to, is because I'm not scared of any of you fuckers. None of you. Cancelled by who? Fucking losing players on social media? Fuck you. What the fuck are you gonna do about it? Oh, you got big bad words on Instagram? You stink, Arivie. Fuck you, dick face. The fuck do you do? I'm coming. I'm not scared of shit. A dead rat to eat or a fucking comment on Instagram. And definitely not fucking going and jumping into a business that I've already proven is good, knowing that I could always get another job. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. You know, reselling, I wish you knew me, bro. Here's the entitled rich kid coming out. Gary, such a clown. I feel so bad for reselling everything. I don't understand why that, what I just did, would trigger that. You don't know me, bro. You really don't. Anyway, I hope everybody's super good. I love all of you. Have the best day. Go get it. Cheer for all of you. The love, the hate and all of it in between. Go get it. Please, if you wanna learn more about V-Friends, DM us, love you guys, DM us. And please use the Paul, incredible moment here with Paul. Paul, I love you, bro. I'm cheering for you so heavy, so heavy. Thank you. I think you can do it. Book all those extra meetings up front. It'll give you the courage to do it. You understand? Yeah. Go ham on the ads and get them. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Everybody, if you wanna learn more about V-Friends, please DM us. All right, Pablo, let's ask T with Gary Vee. It's back and it's better than ever on what not. Mooma asks, how do you remain positive about progressing and taking risk when you have multiple life challenges happening at once? Yet you're in survival mode. I'm generally an upbeat person who can handle a lot, but lately it's been way too much at once. Listen, you're allowed to have like bad moments and you're allowed to have it's too much at once. At the same token, stick with me here, Pablo. You have no fucking choice. Do you know what's funny about life? Pablo, you know life? Let me tell you a little bit about life. Life doesn't give a fuck about your feelings. Some days it's easy, some days it's harder, but it's always good if you realize like you could be dead. You could have never been born. Whatever you're upset about, there's a worse version of that. Like whatever you're upset about, how many people here have children? Say children in the chat. Every person, Courtney, that just said children in the chat, God forbid, no matter what they're upset about, got fired today. Have no idea how they're getting their next check. Still better than God forbid losing their child this morning. You know, that's just life. How do I deal with it? Perspective, Pablo. Putting things in perspective. Deciding to be grateful for what I have, versus dwelling on what I don't have or what's not going well, and just living that life, and realizing that you can go backwards. That's the key. Realizing you can always go backwards. This is what's killing people, keeping up with the Joneses, the people's opinions. Whatever you're worried about, you can go backwards. Toxic job, quit. But Gary, fuck you, you don't get it. Yeah, I do get it, actually. By the way, on the record, none of my answers in my life have anything to do with my own part. I do not come from a focus group of one. I couldn't answer any question that way. I only have one life. I only have my realities and perspectives. This is the cumulation of reading one trillion messages over the last 20 years, and then watching how it plays out. Pablo, Courtney, do you know how many people email me nine years later and be like, now I get it? Nine years later. Watch this. People in the chat right now hated me at one point, but now understand me and are thankful. Put thankful in the chat. Hated me, not dislike me. Like, look at this. Like the chat went so many on one, these are, now let me tell you why there's so many people that say thankful. Like why there's so many people. It's because when I talk, I poke. That person just asked me like, yo, bro, I'm struggling, what's up? And I'm like, fuck you. That's not the normal answer. So no shit. Like, you know, like no shit. So, man, I don't know. Like, I just want this so bad for all of you. Like how do you deal with it? And this person, Pablo, by the way, sounds like they're gonna win because they're normally upbeat. They're just dinged a little bit. Even the best fighters of all time get knocked down. Right? Like I watched Joe Frazier throw a left, I mean, I wasn't alive at the time, or I might have been alive, but I watched the video. I saw Joe Frazier throw a left hook that dropped Muhammad Ali, dropped him right there. Couple of blocks away, Madison Square Garden. But he's the greatest. But obviously in that moment, when he took that left hook, he wasn't better than Joe Frazier, let alone the greatest. That's life. Do you know that, you know, Brandon Warnke? You know, who runs Wine Library? Him and I did 60 card shows together. And we set up next to each other. And do you know that 59 of those 60 card shows, I made more money than him? But this one miraculous day, in the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, for whatever reason, the fucking gods decided to smile down on Brandon. And he just sold card after card after card. Brandon beat me. That's it, Pablo. Piona asked, what would you do if your business partner says, I'm a parent first and can't work more than 10 hours? I would not be business partners with that person. 10 hours, that's not even a fucking employee. That's not even an employee, bro. Partner? 10 hours? I hope she means a day. Bro, being a parent first is remarkable. I'm about that life. I champion. I love people that decide to work 20 to 30 hours a week and spend all their time with their kids. There's just a secondary aspect of that, which is called money's gonna be harder. But that's okay. I'm just confused by someone who thinks that they can work 10 hours a week and have a business that buys them a Benzo and a Rolex and a Four Seasons trip in Miami, which may not be that person. She or he might have their shit right. They're like, yo, I got 10 hours for you. Take it or leave it. My answer to this person's leave it. Find a partner that's giving you 70 hours. But you know, it's fine. Like I don't judge. Like I have no interest in spewing any opinion on how someone wants to live their life. What I'm confused by and I'm trying to get people out of is entitlement. If that person, if I was sitting with those two people, if I heard the person that's got 10 hours a week expecting their partner to do all these things, expecting for it to work, there's no business on earth that is going to get anywhere with 10 hours a week. Promise. Now, if this person's working 100 hours and carrying the other person and their 50, 50 partners, then that person's a sucker. Now, I've been a sucker my whole life. I've done it for my brother, my dad, everybody. That's what I do. I'm a sucker, but that's fine. Cause I love those people. It's good to be a sucker if you love them. It's bad to be a sucker if you don't love them. That's what I got. Next question. Juju asks, what advice would he give to someone who's battling with trauma with little to no money to seek professional help? And it affects their day-to-day interactions. Yet I try to achieve goals in my daily life. What should I do? Well, look, I mean, I think at the end of the day, not everybody's going to be able to afford therapy, but there's a lot of ways to break out of trauma or unhappiness that don't require paying a therapist, hundreds of dollars, exercise, there's changing the people you hang out with. And then my favorite one, which is, I genuinely believe they're doing it right now. Consuming content and information that is optimistic, practical and positive is dramatically better than hanging around with negative people and consuming content that is negative, fear-based, wheezy world. Thank you so much for the raid. That's the answer, Pablo. Like you gotta really face truth. You've also gotta accept a very important thing that people struggle with in life, which is they think shit is their fault when it's not. When you have an abusive parent, when you have a teacher or a coach that does something wrong, these are not indications of you, they're indications on others. I have had plenty of things that have not been awesome in my life. I've had the capacity to understand that they're not my fault. Like I didn't deserve it. I think that's the real issue at hand, right? Like I just don't understand why people, no, no, Threlon said, Bill Belichick isn't a bad coach, UNC is just bad. That's wrong. Bill Belichick is a shit coach. I'm gonna end up being historically correct on this. I've stood on this business that the motherfucker is like terrible in his 11 seasons without the greatest player of all time and miraculously great when he has the greatest player. And by the way, that greatest player of all time left, went to Tampa Bay and won a fucking Super Bowl in his fucking 40s. So, you know, I don't love the guy in football life, Tom Brady, but fuck man, he must be smiling, hard as shit. I couldn't have been happier last night watching TCU dismantle UNC and that will continue because he's overrated. Otherwise, so that is his fault. He's the head coach. Though I'll give him a pass. Let's see what he does over three years because I know he didn't recruit those kids. That is the answer to the question. You must learn to love yourself and you must not take on other people's negativity towards you as an indication that it's you. And then finally, you must, and I mean must, stop consuming negativity. Going through your feed, laying in bed at 9.45 PM for an hour and 20 minutes before you go to sleep, just going through your feed about negative shit of why America is gonna collapse and why everything is bad and why this generation has it the worst and all that shit is doing nothing for you. And then on top of that, you have fucking CNN and Fox News on the background, two places that also sell fear. The whole fucking world is selling fear. Don't consume it. You don't need therapy. E3 Mike says CNN consistently negative news, true. And guess what? Fox News is scaring you all as well. Everything's scaring you. Fox is scaring you, CNN's scaring you, MSNBC's scaring you, ABC's scaring you. Like everything's scaring you. Period. Left, right, scaring you. They got all of you on lock. You are all bunched up. You're on lock. You're on Reavis Island. You guys are all on lock. You think you're not. You think you're on one side or the other. I'm telling you right now, you're all getting fucking hoodwinkled. You're all being told the same shit in a different angle. Be scared. Be scared of the immigrants. Be scared of George Sorra. You're just being, all they're telling you is the same shit. Pablo, give me another question. Oh, we got another giveaway. It's staying, it just popped again. The winner is Drew Conner 1992. I'm gonna assume Drew was born in 92, so that's a nice little win for the young skirt. All right, Pablo, get back to it. Heather asks, I'm working on opening a used clothes store in my hometown. We live in a high poverty county in Virginia and there are no other stores in our county that sell affordable clothing. What should our content strategy be to market our store? Social media. You should post four to five clips a day across seven platforms, pictures and videos of the clothes. I mean, Pablo, do you see what my life is? I see you laughing. You've only been here for five minutes. I've done this for 20 fucking years. People just want the affirmation. Like, are we fucking, like, come on. It's just fucking content. Like, it's always gonna be content. It is content. It's just the way it is. It's just the way it is. It's just content. Your content strategy needs to be what your value. When people ask me what should we post, you should post what your values are. You should post the shit that you would tell people is good about your store. Like, why the fuck should someone come to your store? Sounds like you have better prices. I don't know. Just like, it's not that complicated. Like, you sell, anybody who sells shit should never have a problem making content. You sell shit. Literally Wine Library, my dad's store, can post 93,000 pieces of content a day because they have 93,000 different wines. You know, so. I don't know. All right, everybody, first of all, everything is on what not. Get over here. It's GaryVee.com slash what not if you're new because I'm about to do a giveaway and it's gonna be a good one. Resilient Red Devil signed hat. I know you've all been looking at the hats. You want them, you got it. Auto, literally 200 bucks free. You get this, you win. You literally put it on eBay, you get 200 free dollars. Who can use 200 free dollars? Put 200 in the chat on what not. Not the other social. Pablo, let's go to the next question on Tea with GaryVee. Rebecca asks, how do I comfort someone who's dealing with the death of a loved one? Just by overly trying as many different things to be sympathetic and empathetic. Like, honestly, there's no right answer. Grief is devastating. I say this all the time, and it's important for all of you to hear, when I lose my mom and dad, there's gonna be really no move other than like, honestly, just don't bother me. You know what I mean? Like, just don't give me shit to think about because I'm out anyway. You need to, one of the biggest mistakes that people make in the world for others is they would like to help people the way they want to help people, not the way the person wants to be helped. I'll give you an example. This is lightweight. I turned 50 on November 14th. Everybody, real quick, please put into your Google Calendar right now. November 14th, I turned 50. I expect all of you to buy 50 VFRIENDS items on my 50th birthday, but we'll get to that later. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I might, anyway, my wife, my family, my best friends, everyone is all over me. Nick Dio, Rodolitz, everyone's all over me. Like, you gotta do something. I'm like, I don't want to do anything. I want to have dinner with my family. High five, go to sleep, see tomorrow. Like, I don't like, I don't want to have a huge party. I don't give a fuck. I don't need to be celebrated. I'm celebrated every day. I don't need anyone to celebrate me. I celebrate myself. Oh, I like that. Right, you like that, right? Like, I don't need it. I don't want 500 people there. I definitely don't want some bullshit gifts. You want to get me a gift on my 50th birthday? Fucking donate to Pencils of Promise or Charity Water. Oh, big, big win for Dig Dogs. Dig Dogs with a huge win, this 50 salmon, that makes me happy. And OG. All right, I'm going with a big one. Everybody, actually, if you're new to what not right now, and you're kind of a nerd, you know, like, meaning Comic-Con, you love Marvel, you love the Joker, you love DC, you like Comic-Con, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Manga, your anime, you're into that shit, but you don't know anything about V-Friends yet. You don't know my universe. You don't know this world. Say that's me, because I got a crazy product for you right now. The Manga stickers featuring Steph Curry. Okay, first of all, that's a lot of that's me. Holy shit. Okay, we got a bunch of new people. All right, I'm really exciting right now. For everyone that said that's me, top left corner, you'll see the logo of V-Friends. In the top left corner, you'll see the logo of V-Friends. This little thing right here, this little red button. Hit that. When you hit that, the third thing on the menu, the third thing on the menu is message us. I have dozens of employees in the chat, in the messages, to help people on board the V-Friends learn how to take the quiz. Adrienne, pin the quiz. vfriends.com slash quiz. Everybody should take it right now and figure out which V-Friend they are.
