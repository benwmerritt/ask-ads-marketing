Hey everyone, how are you? Thanks for having me. Can I answer any questions? Actually, how many people here have no idea who I am? Raise your hand. Shit, okay. ["Mackerel"] Sob, I've been telling you. ["Mackerel"] Heading out of Utah. I'm gonna talk this morning a lot of energy. You know how many people here want to build a business or a personal brand so they can buy stuff with it? Like, you know, that thing I said the other day on the vlog, right? Like, I don't want to buy a private jet like everybody tells me to do but they see that I'm wasting an hour on an extra commercial flight because I want to buy the New York Jets. You know what I mean? And like... And so... All this behavior, my man, is predicated on insecurity. You know why 24-year-old dudes buy watches? Because they're not confident and they need that to get a girl. Like, all those dudes that are flashing on social media, I look at them like, insecure. Like, not real confident. You know, puffed up fake. So, you know, it's the same old thing. It's the same reason people buy followers on social... Guys, and some of you did it because one of the people I looked at last night that's here with the hashtag, bought it, you know how I know? You can't have 800,000 followers on Instagram and get 27 comments and 94 likes. I ended my talk with it, which is the worst business is to sell to losers and I promise you there's a stunning amount of people here who try to sell to the bottom feeders. And you never trick winners. When people DM me and they're like, Yo, GaryVee, check me out, I'm killing it. And they've got 900,000 followers on Instagram, but they don't actually have it. I reply, no, you aren't. And then their feelings are hurt. And it makes me feel awesome. Hold your breath, keep building for the audience, bring them value. You know what your next Instagram post should be instead of taking 400 bucks for a sponsored ad? Why don't your next Instagram post be, what can I do for you guys to make this account better? And then read all the comments and then act on them. Got it. Different kind of vibe too, again. A lot of weird roll. Taking different vibes. Stop hiring more services, coaches, people. All with your disguises for you not to actually do the work. A lot of admiration, a lot of love, a lot of selfies. Too fast, ain't no such thing as too fast. Too fast, because they are dropped to the ground. Really interesting moment right now, as you guys know from the CFO episode, there's just a lot going on, like very deep in my business, a lot of new business we're winning. Just a great day in my email. The whole Vayner Daily Digital deep dive. Daily Digital deep dive, Daily Digital deep dive. So many of you coming to VaynerMedia spending, I mean it's so exciting, 9 to 7, like 10 hours at VaynerMedia with all of the practitioners in culture, strategy, paid media, so that's been fun. We've sold a bunch of seats, first day sold out, second day's about to sell out. So that's going well, nice new business unit for us and huge for you. What else? Just a lot of content. I think people are too crippled by content. I call it the 14 year old teenage move, which is so many 14 year olds post on Instagram and then if they don't get enough likes right away, they take it down. There are literally 14 year old teenage girls that take an hour and a half to take a selfie because they put it up 7 times until there's actual engagement. They keep taking it down. And the truth is we all say yep, yep, yep, and yet you're doing it as well. You're overthinking your content. Like think about, like again, eating my own dog food. I believe that all content is valuable one way or the other or it may or may not be valuable. Every person here has put up something on the internet that has done better than they thought it would and has done worse than they thought it would. Why should you test it? It's much faster to just keep putting it out. Like all the thought of testing it and let me overthink it and like why? Like everybody thinks they're going to put out a piece of content that's going to hurt you? Like what is it going to do? It's not going to get as many likes as you like? Like again, way too much ego and insecurity driving decisions. Let the chips fall where they are. Just put out fucking content. Cool, that's a good way. I'm out. Thank you. Bye guys. Thanks again. You're welcome. Bye guys. Thank you. Bye guys. Take care. Take care. Tell her mom emailed us. Which is insane. A lot of offers. I had just a lot going on. Planet of the Apps, my TV show. Just saw the media play. That's going to be insane. We're going to be seeing a whole lot of this face in different forms. My neck. Fixing my neck. Got this new awesome t-shirt. Right? Tortoise in a hair's costume. That's me. Seen fast. And I am. I'm micro fast. But I'm macro slow. You killed it today. I killed it. What's this? This is a bunch of... Am I coming to say hello? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's score. So we'd like to welcome to the stage here Gary Vaynerchuk. And appreciate you taking time to be here. And without a whole lot of introduction, I'm just going to hand him the mic and let him rip. Thanks Gary. No worries. Hey everyone. How are you? Thanks for having me. Can I answer any questions? Actually, how many people here have no idea who I am? Raise your hand. Shit. Okay. When you incentivize somebody to do something that is predicated on rewarding them with something else, you're not actually getting the natural action. I hate it. I hate like watch this video or play this game and you'll get 5000 points and then you get a fucking iPad. Horseshit. Don't like it. They all lose. They all have a run. Somebody exits because whatever. But 9 out of 10 of them lose every time because you're creating your forcing behavior instead of reacting to behavior. Got it? All right. See ya. I continue to build my brand more than any other reason. And there's a lot of vanity that comes with it. There's a lot of financial aspects that come along with it. But I want everybody to know and again, my behavior is proven this because I did it before this happened. The single biggest reason I continue to build my personal brand is it forces me every single day to use Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr. It forces me. And then I become the plumber, not just the architect. And there's way too many architects in here and there's way too many plumbers in here and there's not enough of people that are both. 2030, 2040. I live for the year 2040. I'm not counting my chickens. I'm not reading my headlines. I'm not even incorporating this admiration that I'm getting right now. I'm zero. I'm nothing. I'm fucking dirt. I haven't even started. I'm a kid. I'm not even doing this. I'm not even doing this. I'm not even doing this. I'm not even doing this.
