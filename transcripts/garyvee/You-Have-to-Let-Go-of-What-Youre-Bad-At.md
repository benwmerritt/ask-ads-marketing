We have to understand what we're good and bad at, and you have to let go of what you're bad at. You have to. If you're naturally bad at singing like I am, you shouldn't put your career and your life in a position to become a professional singer. It's a bad idea. And I think a lot of people want to be entrepreneurs and business people, because it sounds glamorous to make a million dollars a year on your terms, on your own schedule. The problem is, it's a talent. It is a talent to be a business person. And you can become the best version of yourself, right? But it's like being pretty. Like, you can become prettier. You can get tans, you can work out. You know, but mom and dad had sex at the right moment and your nose is your nose. Now you can have plastic surgery. There is no plastic surgery in business. So I need people to wrap their head around that. I don't know how to help people do more of it other than scream at the top of my lungs about it for the rest of my life. But anything that can help you get into a place where you can not dwell, not complain, not allow the negativity to seep in, it will bring you enormous dividends. And whether that's a life coach or a therapist or a two month retreat to reset, or I don't know. But whatever it is, please, please, please realize how big of a deal it is. Thank you.
