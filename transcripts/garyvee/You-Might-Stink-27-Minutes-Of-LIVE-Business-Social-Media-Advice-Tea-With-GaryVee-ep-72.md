## Transcript
I've been a stand-up comedian for 10 years. When I started, we were always told, don't put your best material online, but now it's quite the opposite. I don't know who you were listening to, because I got clips from 10 years ago telling you the complete opposite. Keep going. How do I break through this period of being stagnant and social? By making more content. The fuck's the matter with everybody? Everybody now judges themselves on, if I do not achieve the .0001% in the world, I'm a loser. The fuck's the matter with you? Bert, you might stink at stand-up. That's okay too. I am not good enough to be in the NBA. I feverishly and excitingly play basketball. Like Bert might just not be destined to be Theo Vaughn or Eddie Murphy, but everybody's got it so twisted in their head. They don't measure success the right way. Bert, what if this is just your best hobby and a little side gig, because it's your love? Now all of a sudden, you're not poisoning yourself that you're a loser. Wait a minute. So let me get this straight. You're a loser because you didn't make it as big as Andrew Schultz or fucking, you know, Wanda Sykes. So you're a loser? Sean says it's just hard not to feel that way. That's not true. It's easy to feel that way. When you believe it's not hard to feel that way. We have a perspective issue that is broken in modern society. We have a perspective issue, my friends. It's very easy to feel that way, Sean. I suck at most things. I'm below average at most things. Everybody is. How do we find our way again? It's simply a mindset. Yes, Luis, therapy. Reading positivity versus negativity. Spending time around uplifting people. Redefining success for yourself. Putting in the work mentally. Life is only perspective. There is no life. Real quick. Who's the winner in this scenario? Somebody makes $280,000 a year, has 100,000 followers on TikTok, but secretly behind the scenes is miserable. Doing drugs, you know, like has bad relationships, unhappy. Or somebody who makes $73,000 a year, has 19 followers on Instagram, has a tremendous relationship, lives paycheck to paycheck, and is stressed. Who? Who's the better person? By the way, I don't think there's a, yeah. By the way, I actually don't think it necessarily has to be number two. Somebody might say I'd rather have a drug problem than worry about financial stress each week. I don't know, it's fine, you're loud. Platinum Dragon says neither. You know, my thing is that number two is healthier because when Platinum says neither, like you have to understand, no matter what your situation is, you have stress. The second one stresses financial paycheck to paycheck, but they have a loving relationship, right? The first one is fronting for the world and is broken foundationally. And the third one, somebody who's financially good, emotionally good, somebody who's financially good, emotionally good. How about that person the next day? Something tragic happens. There's just always shit. I just, I think we all need to go to the fucking cemetery, dig up everybody, talk to them, be like, yo, real quick, was your life perfect the whole time? I don't think we're finding anyone. It is that simple. Tres says it's not that simple. Guess what, bro? It is that simple. Tres, it is that simple. It's that simple. I live that simple. I know that many people. I know tons of people. DJ Kaufman said it is that simple. I know DJ's living that simple. There's just that simple. It is that simple. Tres, I'm looking forward to hearing your thing. I'm looking forward to our exchange. It is that simple. Because there's nothing you're gonna say to me, not one thing you're gonna say to me. That's not gonna say in my mind that you can control where you go forward. At what point do we become a grown up? Can everybody answer in the chat the year that you think it's time for you to stop blaming your parents? Like everybody, like Mason, what's the appropriate age where you now have to stand on your own two feet and you can't blame your parents no more? At least 20. You think 20. Good. Pops? 18 for you. Mackens? 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. Sid? 18. Great. I don't know. Like, by the way, I'm not even sure what I think. I actually think it's circumstantial. I think sometimes it's 11. I think sometimes it's 31. I think it's all fine. But everybody just answered. I'm just curious. Who the fuck was right in here? Who was right? The first two are about you controlling the situation with an action. The third one is you controlling the situation with a macro action, not a micro action. The first two is you quit. You know, this is the same old shit. If you don't like your job, if you feel your boss thinks you suck, if you don't like it, if you don't feel valued or validated, live on fucking Indeed in LinkedIn until you get a fucking new job. People just love rolling in their mud. Unfortunately, that's what a lot of people are in life. They literally live in complaining about their husband every day, live in life complaining about their job, their wife, their girlfriend. They love, they love to point fingers about how their older brother or younger sister got lucky or they have it so good. Stop rolling in fucking mud. New York City says life is tough or life is easy. Simplify your shit. Take control. McKens, do you know how many people are much happier right now than they've been historically because this last political cycle, they were just like, fuck it, I'm just not even going to pay attention. They took control of what they consumed, and thus they were less anxious and upset. And then the third one is stop valuing other people's opinions. When you go somewhere and people make you feel lesser than, fuck them. The fuck are you looking up to celebrities for? The fuck are you looking up to business people that made more money than you for? The fuck are we looking up to? We completely lost our way. We still look up to fucking our grandpa. You know who used to be famous in 1950 in America? Pilots and astronauts and politicians. Now it's fucking people who are selling sex on apps. Fuck man, like what are we fucking looking up to? Like don't look up to me because I'm good at making money. Look up to me because I treat people nice. Don't look up to me because I'm any followers I have. Look up to me because I'm sitting here and I'm trying to give value. The fuck are we looking up to? You feel lesser than in a room? Fuck that room. Fuck that room. I don't give a fuck about any room. That doesn't fucking want you there. Fuck that room. If a room doesn't want me, they fucking lost. I promise you that. Your self-esteem is broken. You're not confident enough that you can get another job. You're not confident enough that you're better than the room. I've been in every room. I've been in every room. And guess what? I don't give a fuck about any room I've ever been in. Not the biggest board rooms in the world. Not the Oval Office. And they're both administrations, Republicans, Democrats. I don't give a fuck about the room. I respect the room. I'm empathetic to the room. I understand the room. But fuck the room. You know how many events I go into where I don't get into the VIP and the people in the VIP are less money than me, less clout than me, less it doesn't even go through my fucking mind. Good for that. I'm happy for them. You think I fucking give a fuck about a velvet rope? The fuck's the matter with people? Enough. Can I can can we just fucking end this shit? Fuck. If the economy crashed tomorrow, what's the first move you'd make? Stop buying dumb shit. Completely go humble, lean into humble hedgehog and humble hummingbird. I would I would immediately as a matter of fact, there's a lot of indications that the economy might be crashing. More but just took all his money into cash. He's usually right. I would tell everybody right now to go to your credit card statement and unsubscribe to the automatic things that you're being built for that you don't use. Mike, how many streaming services are you signed up for? Tell the truth. Three. Three. Mike, I know how much you get paid. You need to have two. You should not have three, Mike. No. Oh my god, Mike. Mackenzie, everyone's acting a fool out here. People are if people went to their credit card statement, actually, let's do that. Let's actually do something productive. Like, do you know, you know, I love building V friends and I do think these collectibles after 20 years are going to really crush for people. But I'm always scared that I'm like, man, I really hope someone that has like $180 in Wells Fargo didn't just buy a $15 figurine, no matter how much they fucking love me. Don't ever, ever, ever buy it. Let's just clip this for the rest of my life. Don't ever buy anything for me unless you can afford it. Easily. Wine, V friend, don't ever buy something for me. Don't ever buy something for me unless you can easily support it. Mike, right now, I know that you've had all sorts of troubles on the ones and twos. We're going to let that slide. If you cancel right now, that's what's the third one. Let's put them on blast. Okay, peacock. All right. Did you order for like a sporting event or a WrestleMania or something real quick? That's how they get you. That's why they pay so much for that shit. Everyone's like Jake Paul's overpaid. No, he's not. He's underpaid. Everybody signed up and now they have an unsubscribed. A lot of you are spending money on dumb shit at scale. And before the economy collapses, why don't you start saving that money? I feel afraid of missing out in life because I cannot teach you any big things. I have big goals. Like I want to be a successful entrepreneur or like public speaker like you. But every time I'm struggling with, I'm doing the full-time job as well. Yes. But every time I'm struggling with like what to I wanted to pursue like in the long term. Like I want to do the public speaking for years. Otherwise I want to pursue the entrepreneurship. How old are you? 23. I know you get the beard and shit and you think you're 27, but you're 23, bro. Right now, what you're probably doing is you're checking the box to, you know, get your foundation, you know, help yourself, help your family. I understand. I did that. But you have unlimited time to achieve your goals. What's the crucial type to take like? Action. Yeah. By taking action, by emailing every, by emailing every single conference that is within two hours driving of you or train or bus and emailing them and saying, I would like to speak for free at your conference and having 50 of them say no. And then one says yes. And then you gave your first talk and then you learn how to give speeches. Yeah. I'm doing some like creative content and building my personal brand as well. For this foundation. You know, brother, you know the answers. Every time I'm struggling with this, why it is not working? What means I'm doing on the wrong stuff? Only because you're only because you're judging actions and you're judging things and too small of a window. When I was 27 years old and a customer came in and they were grabbing a bottle of wine and they dropped that bottle of wine and the bottle falls and it spills. And I went to the back room and got the mop to clean it up. Do you think anybody watching me at that moment at 27 years old, mopping up wine in a liquor store in Springfield, New Jersey said, you know what, that kid is going to be a world renowned entrepreneur and on the cover of magazines and fucking taking the biggest stages in the world. Do you think people thought that? Don't judge your actions within a little window to justify where you're going. Do you know why I like patients? Yeah. Do you know why? Because it's great in state time maybe. No, because we have no choice. It's practical. Here are your options for success. Believe in patients, do the right things and build your foundation or say, fuck you, Gary, and go try to do quick rich schemes until they all fail and you're 40 and you're a fucking loser and nobody wants to be around you. You don't know. I don't want any exams and all. Yeah, I want to get it. Even I have that goal as well, but I want to build the right skillset. So go do shit. My man, my man, what, how many hours a day do you work at your job? I do like nine to 10 hours. Like, yeah. Great. What do you do with the other 14 hours of your life? I'm creating some content. Another time I'm learning from this person brand, like attending these workshops and all. Another time I'm exploring some new ideas, like how to like speak on the stages and practicing the public speaking skills and all. I think you're what, how much do you sleep? I sleep like six to seven hours. Wonderful. You're winning. You're winning. You're doing everything right. Yeah. Stop being scared. I think I'm not like a mortise. I'm not on a right track because I know I am here, but I have these goals like past since two years, but I procrastinate on it. Why? So I regret now why I have with the waste at that time. So I have that regret. Brother, you can't. Listen, having ambition is phenomenal, but beating yourself up on little technicalities is a problem. Yeah. Yeah. And I struggle with procrastination because I cannot say discipline and self-affordable for myself. So I'm learning that how to be disciplined and how to stay consistent on my game. Can I, can I ask you one favor and then I have to go on. Can I ask you one favor? Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. Now that we have this moment, could you promise me one thing? Yeah. Be nicer to yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Have good confidence in myself. Yeah. Not confidence. Be nicer to yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Last year, I would say my impact was miniscule. I had to build a foundation for VaynerX's infrastructure. I had to build a foundation for VFriends to be a live commerce and product company. You guys all know here, you all know here. I sat in that fucking room 12 hours a day the whole year. I didn't Gary V. It. I wasn't on stage. I wasn't making brand happen. We struggled with content all year because I wasn't feeding you like I'm doing finally now again. I would fucking sat in that fucking office for 12 hours a day. No big meetings. Nobody fancy. You watched it. Yeah. You just not you hearing my stories in the liquor store. You fucking watched it at the height of my career. I sat in that fucking office for 12 hours a day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a cool. So bro, I don't know what you're worried about. I don't know what you're worried about the last two years. What? Last thing I have, I have a smaller one. When I'm passing my entrepreneurship, I'm helping with my mom's business like food business. And I want to do other business as well. And I'm exploring some ideas. What's a good firm when starting a business? A good book? No book. Use chat, gpt and ask a questions that are on your mind. Yeah. Like even I have some new ideas, but I'll struggle with what I have to start like have some like a startup ideas and want to sing like build some like what is even hosting platforms. Brother, you don't have you don't have ideas problems. You have action problems. Yeah. Maybe the execution is the game. Yeah. And the action will come once you build a nice foundation from your patience. You understand? Yeah. All right. I love you. I got to move. That was good. Listen, I got a little emotional there for a second. You guys know how I roll. Like, did you see I fucking sat in that room? Like, please, everybody. There's going to be years that are not like how you thought they were going to be. There's going to be moments. Then there's some real gangster bad shit that happened. By the way, nobody's crying for me that I sat there for 12 hours. Some people lost their mom and dad. Some people lost their spouse. Some people had their child diagnosed with leukemia. Many people had their whole fucking house burnt down in Los Angeles. The fuck are we crying about out here? Everybody forget about those fucking unbelievable amounts of people. That lost their fucking home in LA. Of course they have. Most people didn't even think about it in the first place. Because you're all worried about your fucking shit. And your shit is good. I promise you right now, if it's 937 in the morning Eastern, and you are watching me on what not, your life is good. The way you do that is by realizing, unfortunately, that's just the game. And, you know, again, the problem with business is it's not charity. It's not altruism. It's not a fucking fairy tale. The best thing you can do is do right by the person the best you can afford. Right? And so give them better severance. Give them a warning. Give them respect by telling them the truth. That just did. It's fucking hard out here when you have to make those decisions. Because you have a lot of love and gratitude for that person. I think the way to do it is in order, clarity, respect. And then if you can afford to be a little gracious, because you feel like they put you on, they helped you, they were there, then you're in your spot. And very honestly, I was great at number three. But it took me a while to get decent at number one and two. And that's that lack of candor that I've talked about. And so I encourage this kid. I wish somebody told me this when I was a kid. Candor is going to make this the best it can be. You know, you were an entrepreneur from a young age. Like, what did your parents do to help you and support you? And what ways, like, did they blow it? Because I kind of wanted not to blow it with my kid, you know? The way that my parents helped me with my entrepreneurship was by staying the fuck out of it, which is the number one hard thing for parents in 2025. Parents are too involved. I'm trying to stay out of it. My husband helped him find shoes to flip. So they kind of have that's amazing. Yep. That's amazing. Yeah, it's really helped him, you know, to get somewhere with this up front. But yeah, okay, that's good to know. That's good to know. And I mean, like, he'll go days without doing a show and we'll be like, hey, you're going to do a show, you know, we just kind of nudge him, but try not to pressure it, I guess. But first of all, I love talking about parenting, but I never ever will ever give a parent direct advice about their direct situation because every situation is too nuanced. And who the fuck am I? I don't know 99.99999 of it. So that's number one. So I would say that, you know, as parents, we always want to help. And you just got to rely on your intuition on when you should be as far away as possible to let him breathe. And then it's great that you might feel like there's a moment where like, look, if you're a parent and the kid is doing this thing, now he's making money. And now he's with that money, he's starting to howling around with kids that you don't like. That's a place where you can nudge, right? You know, and and how and how you nudge needs to be, you know, like strategic, like one of the I like to talk to kids that are 15 like grown ups. Like if I was talking that kid, I'm like, so let me get this straight. You work your face off to build a sneaker flipping business. Now you got a little bit of money and what you're going to hang out with dudes that smoke fucking weed all day and be a loser. That's a fun like that's now that would work for some kids for other kids. Maybe that's not your temperament. Maybe that not will work. Like there's just a lot of different ways to look at it. But what I would say, what I would say is that for an entrepreneur, he needs to lose the biggest mistake that your dad, your husband and you can make in this situation is protect him from losing. Do you know how many times I made money and lost to all of it between 13 and 17? That's why I don't lose it anymore. The best thing that can happen to your son, the single best thing is for him to lose all his money that he's made up to this point. It is the single best thing that could happen and it's not even close and it's not even close. Good. Good. Well, that's different. That's not losing it. That's not what I'm saying. And I love that you're making pay for a card. That's like great parenting to begin with. But I'm telling you right now, the number one thing that you and your husband have to watch out for the best thing that could happen to this kid on earth and it's not even close. Is he decides to go put all his money into something because he wants to get a better car and it goes to zero and you don't buy him a car. It's the single best thing that can happen. Okay. That's that's actually great advice because the last thing we want to see our kids do is like work so hard and then lose everything and then we think that it's going to hold them back. But really it's it's not so correct. Yeah. What do you want him to be a fake entrepreneur? No. So no entrepreneur's fucking lose. Let him keep going. Let him win and lose. Let stay the fuck out other than if he's doing something egregious or illegal or something that's against your moral compass. Well, it sounds like this. Do you have any advice for him? Moving forward? Probably. You know, I just need to talk to him and understand what his questions are. But you have him. Let him email me at Gary at vfriends.com. What's his channel so people here can go check him out? Yeah, it's at Texas sneakers. So at TX and then S and K. R. S. He went cool like that. I like it. Listen, I got two final things to say. Number one, your boy sounds like you got very lucky in his DNA and that's you and your husband. And two, it sounds like he's got really good parents. You're doing a good job. Now get the fuck out of his way. I'm going to answer by living it right now. These are the very rare series two cards before the top scrum card comes out. These are $40 a pack. If you're into Pokemon, that kind of stuff, you'll know what's going on. All right. So packs are up. There you go. So here are packs, right? So I'm doing tea with Gary Vee right now. I'll interject. Now real quick, everybody, if it's your first time ordering, you can actually get this for 25 bucks by clicking this little show notes. E-Wast Direct just bought. So I'm having a show, but there's commerce in it. Right now, what's going on in social shopping? Why does it work? Because human behavior likes to buy in real time. I personally, me, Gary, who's extremely disciplined and doesn't like to buy stuff, have bought things on whatnot and TikTok shop in the live experience because of the momentum. You're almost paying for an experience. What do you get when you go to a standup comedy show or a concert or a sporting event? What do you get? What do you take home? Nothing physical, but you're paying for the entertainment. I believe that there's a subconscious underlining layer of the entertainment value that's going on. And I think the hype and the excitement is why people do well and not well on QVC. Some people are good at it. Some people are not. And it's enjoyable. It's a more fun way to shop than to see like a picture in your Instagram feed. Think about the difference of somebody just seeing a picture of this. Me and Sid, we do our best. We have a picture, even a video or even a video of me being like, this is the next Pokemon. Get in early. You're going to regret not buying this for 40 bucks. I'm fucking Gary Vee. I'm telling you right now, you're going to regret not buying this for 40 bucks. That's a good ad. It'll do fine. But I'm telling you, it'll do even better right now in real time because I could also interact. Right? Commerce payment to me is when you're doing a live show, selling stuff like I am now, but you're more focused on entertainment and value. Tea with Gary Vee. I'm more focused on bringing people value right now. And there's an element of them tipping me for that and wanting to support me. They know me. I'm bringing them value and they're like, you know, this is important to Gary. Let me buy $40 pack. Shit. He might be right. I might be happy I have these in a couple of years and sell them on the bay. The bay is eBay. I'm feeling very, very scared that I'm going to quit my high paying job and start everything from scratch with being very unsure about my income potential. I have some money accumulated, which I have considered as my freeway for the next six months or one year to survive. I am not earning. I can't motivate you out of your fear consistently. I can make you feel better for the next hour. But I'm going to give you information that might make you feel better forever. I have no idea if you're going to pull this off or not. But I'm so happy for you because high paying jobs for someone like you are always going to be there. Even if you were meant to win, maybe the global economy melts. Right. Anything can happen. This is business. This is life. But you've already won, brother. Here's why. The amount of people that are 67 year old you who wanted to try and did not. And every day it eats at them every day. You will never have that. You may lose your savings, but you're a fucking kid. You're going to make more savings again. And there's nothing embarrassing about not being an entrepreneur. There's nothing wrong with being a great team player in a corporation or company. It'd be nice for you to pick a company you enjoy being in. You enjoy the people you're around. That's important. That's a real quality of life issue. But you'll never, ever, ever wonder if you could have. And it's going to be a tremendous experience. And I'm proud of you and I'm happy for you. Tony asks, you keep mentioning organic social media. What do you mean by that? When I say organic social media, I mean just posting on social media without using media dollars to amplify your post. I don't have money to go back to school now. How do I reset by getting a job outside of the fact that I met Sid at the college that I was speaking at? I do not know if anyone here graduated college and even more funny if they even where they went. I could not tell you where any of you went. Have no clue. Get a fucking job, bro. So anyway, that's where I'm fucking at. I'll see you later.
