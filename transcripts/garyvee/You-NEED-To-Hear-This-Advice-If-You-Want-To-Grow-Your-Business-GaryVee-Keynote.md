You picked a really good fucking time to be alive at this age. The opportunities, I think a lot about us that came up in the game pre-internet. When I think about what you have at your disposal in your phone to do business, my mom literally, she's like, if you had the internet and social media, you would have never graduated high school. You must weaponize time as you go on this journey. It is the biggest asset you have. Use it to get deep, to get knowledgeable. Entrepreneurship's the best. If you're an entrepreneur. If you're not, it's real bad. Because what's crazy about entrepreneurship is it is the closest thing to sports. It has merit. You can't hide behind being crappy at your job and you get fired and you're like, the boss was a dick. And they're like, yeah, the boss is a dick. You can hide in corporations. You can hide in academia. You can hide in government. You can hide in parenting. You can hide in most society. The greatest thing about sports is you can't hide. Somebody wins, somebody loses, we watch it. The next closest thing is business, is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is getting so cool that people want to do it for it, for the glow of it, for the brand of it to be cool. That's great to a point. If you leave with anything here today, this is not to talk you out of being an entrepreneur. This is to talk you in to being who you actually are. I promise you, the number 23456789 and 10 at Facebook made a lot more money than the number one in 99.99999% of businesses. If you leave with anything in my talk, anything, please leave with, it is remarkably okay. And actually, wildly recommended to actually be who you actually are. And you might be an operator, and you might be a salesperson, and you might be a charismatic leader, and you might be a developer, and you may be a lot of things, and you may be a CEO founder. But please do not demonize all the other things you could be on a winning team because of the framework of the explosion of entrepreneurship. It is absolutely in my mind the greatest. But I just got lucky that my mom and dad had sex at the right exact moment. And I think about that a lot. Not my parents having sex. I think a lot about just DNA. I just think a lot about how many things come natural to me and why that's important in my success and how many things don't come natural to me and my thought process on, do I want to get better at this a little bit because I have to close this vulnerability, or do I want to get better at this because it really matters? Or do I want to do what I have done my whole career and I've watched many others do from a far or up close on boards, being as investor of understating some shit you just suck at, and that's okay too. That's why you fucking hire other people to do it. So to me self-awareness would be the biggest thing. The other thing is your timing's impeccable. You pick the really good fucking time to be alive in this age. The opportunities, I think a lot about us that came up in the game pre-internet. When I think about what you have at your disposal in your phone to do business, my mom literally and I joked about this a couple of weeks ago. She's like college, she's like, if you had the internet and social media, you would have never graduated high school. And then she like took a beat and she's like, maybe even middle school. The timing of your opportunity is obnoxious. It's remarkable because there's so much opportunity. It's also a little bit different because you're competing against everyone. We're really competing against everyone, but some of the trends, and this is where I hope to get into Q and A, the timing is remarkable because there's so much going on. There is so much going on right now of opportunity in the world and there's a couple of trends that I wanna call out before we go into the Q and A. And I'm just gonna give you straight stuff that if you're sitting in this room and you're hyped about your journey, but you don't know exactly what company you wanna start or what you wanna build, I'm just gonna give you a couple of macro things that I see. One of the core pillars of my career is seeing what consumers are about to do a little bit earlier than others. The first one, and it's not even close, live shopping, social live shopping is here. It's been in China for seven, eight years. It's very easy for you to look at what's been going on over there, see the pattern recognition, but it's tipped. It's tipped in North America. If you have an apparel brand, if you wanna start a retail store, if you wanna start a beauty brand, shit. If you wanna sell anything, if you wanna sell anything, I am more interested in pushing you to do 20 to 50 hours of homework on live shopping, social, than opening a store, than opening a Shopify, I know that's sacrilege in Canada. Though you should open a Shopify. You should contemplate, well, you're gonna need it to integrate into the backend, but instead of affiliate, which is also a great move, live social shopping, TikTok shop, an app called What Not, how many people here are familiar with What Not? Raise your hands. Nine. Like it's, and I'm telling you, it's big, big, and it's real, real. And so when I thought a lot about, what do I wanna talk about? I'm like, I wanna leave them with tangible shit. Like this is exactly the point in your life where you can like leave right here and go get a $1 cheeseburger and get the fucking work. And so live shopping is real serious. I highly recommend you looking at that. Next, for all these inspired, aspiring influencers, I have bad news. Virtual influencers are coming and they're gonna take your money. So the other space that I would highly recommend you look into is I believe in the next decade, most of half of the influencers that matter, the Charlie deMilleos, the Logan Pauls, the Mr. Beasts, will not be actual human beings. They will be AI avatars in real form, not McKayla that looks like a robot. No, no, like the girls that some of you see on Instagram that you think is a real girl, but she's already fake. That's gonna happen for everything. It starts with porn and like sex tend to innovate first, but you'll see 73 year old grandmothers that are fake people pushing grandma shit on social in two years. You can own that. Intellectual property, I see some of you which I appreciate rockin' the entrepreneur elf gear. I have an intellectual property called V-Friends. I'm building it because I don't know if you know this, but Pokemon is worth $100 billion. Let me say it slow for the kids in the back. Pokemon is worth $100 billion. Intellectual property, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney, Hello Kitty, monster businesses. I've been following it for a long time. I've always wanted to buy one. I decided to start one. Intellectual property is a monster business. The fact that intellectual property is now gonna sleep into fame and celebrity is bananas. I believe that 50% of the most famous people on earth in a decade will not be actual real people. They will be owned by people and companies. And I highly recommend, again, what's so, let me tell you what the man whose name is on the building and the man who's got the mic on the stage, let me tell you what our envy is of you all, time. What you have is when I say these two things, the smart business people in the front, they don't have the time to allocate the 100 hours, the 200 hours to go deep and put in that sweat that's required to actually really crush. All of you do. You must weaponize time as you go on this journey. It is the biggest asset you have. Use it to get deep, to get knowledgeable. When I saw the internet, like I talked about in that video, freshman year in college, koo kooch, that thing, the second I saw it, I was like, that. And then for the next four months, instead of doing fucking keg stands, I fucking just worked and figured it out. And that became the foundation of why I even get to stand here today. If one of the first two things I just talked to you about, live social shopping or virtual influencers, gave you that, the next 400 hours of work on doing something about it is gonna be the punchline. The greatest thing about entrepreneurship that's very different than politics is you have to actually execute on it. I don't know if you know this, but you can't read about push-ups. You have to actually fucking do them. And that's how this game is. You can read all you want about live shopping or virtual influencers or anything else that you want to do, build a direct to consumer tennis racket business or whatever you're thinking. But the only way you get good at this game is by practice. And the great words of Alan Iverson, practice. Yeah, we're talking about practice. It's the only way you can actually win this. For everybody under 30, raise your hands. I thought you were gonna raise your hand. One more time, hi. This is disproportionately my favorite piece of advice. I know that it is not commonly thought of, but I cannot wait till I'm in heaven looking down when the world fully agrees with me on this one. From 20 to 30, the only things you should be doing is ridiculously high risk, high reward activities based on shit you fucking like. I'm telling you. Cause this is the age where you guys can get together and have six of you in a fucking studio and eat dog shit food and be fine. If Rick fucking ate dog shit food, he'd be out of commission for two fucking days. Shitting his pants. Right? I'm telling you, you gotta look at the OGs. We know we fucking lived it. This is, so the answer to your question is, what do you like? What is your favorite shit on earth? Like that is what the business you should start. Not where you think the money is, not what you heard, not what you saw. Like what are you most into? Music, sports, nightlife, fashion, whatever it is, that's what you should do. Because if you love it so much, you're gonna have the energy to actually put in the 18 hours a day that is actually fucking required to actually build something. My question is, so I recently started a business and a podcast. Yes. I wanna know how I can grow that and I can leverage that to help me reach my goal, which is to donate $1.5 million to Sick Kids Hospital. And I wanna leverage using my podcast and my business and I wanna know how I can make that money so I can donate. So why 1.5? Because I just feel like, I feel like that would be, that's just a base number for me. If I could do more, it's even better. The reason I asked that question is, I think you should take that number out of the equation. Even based on your answer, meaning 1.5 is remarkable and unbelievable. 3 million, unbelievable. But so is 10,000. And I think when I think about goals and I'm using your question to make sure I bring value to everybody, one of the great mistakes people make. And that doesn't mean have big goals and big numbers. There's a lot of smarts to having goals. But sometimes when people's goal becomes the energy, they start to make wrong decisions. You are more likely to donate 1.5 million dollars by focusing on everything but the 1.5 number. So let me tell you this. Far as the podcast, how can you do it? What's the business? So my business, I create websites, blog loads, I do video editing. Love. And I post on LinkedIn and try to get people to reach out to have my services. From my podcast, I interview professionals and I ask them what their advice is through young people to work with them success. How many podcasts have you done? I've only recorded my first episode last week. Amazing. So basically, I think the way you will do this to pull it off is you need to interview dozens. Probably a hundred is gonna be my guess based on your goal. A hundred people. And when you put up the podcast, I'm sure you know this because you're growing up in this era, you need to make sure that you clip the best clips from the podcast and post them all organically on the seven social networks that matter. And so to pull that off, you basically have to spend as many hours as you can DMing as many prominent people that have audiences as you can and be prepared for 99% to be no and build off of that. I'm gonna make you a deal. I will do your 55th podcast if you can get to 54. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. How do you moment a side project and become your main gig? You don't. This entire summer I've been working on. You don't. You don't. So like, I mean, you do, if your side gig explodes and everybody's buying your shit, it's kind of like, oh fuck. But like, do you know how many people, bro, jumped off three months before it was gonna happen? And do you know how many people hung onto some shit eight years too long? You don't. You know, like there's just all of us again who've been in the game. We know this. Timing is everything. It's real. But do you know you don't? What you know is your situation. Why I, why others that I admire win is our tolerance of pain. Tolerance. Please. So how do you know like, you can take that down because like can I just explain the situation real quick? This entire summer I spent my time just like working on how to build an AI real estate agent. Okay. And like I use my dad's real estate license. I use my friends as connections. And like I just use my friends like open the iCredit and like we just built something together. I did eight pieces. Now I don't know if that's enough to just pursue it as a main gig or like. What's holding you back? Eight sounds good. I thought you were gonna say zero. Eight's amazing. Right? School's holding you back. Quit. I don't want to. My terrible situation. You have to stay. I don't want to. So quit. So you should just pull the trigger? Yeah quit school. Oh my God. I mean, I mean, look at you inspired those who's, those four dudes are leaving right now. They're quitting school right the fuck now. Let's fucking go boys. Let's fucking go. Entrepreneurship is not taught in a classroom with all due respect. Are you, I assume you're worried about what your parents are gonna think. Yeah, that's my only worry. About because you love them or because you're on the payroll. No, because I love them and they expected something. Like they came to Canada for me so now. I get it. So then do what I did. I did that. I ate shit, played video games, played C-Lo, played spades and got the fuck out. This, if you're a real entrepreneur, this is the, how many more years you got? I have four more years. Great. This is the best four years of your life. This is the last fucking vacation of your life. Go enjoy the shit out of it. Just get by and get whatever fucking grades this place needs you to get and fucking go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As a founder, I'm putting my ears to the ground. I'm speaking to a lot of customers and trying to sell what I need to do. But I have a co-founder and I want to know, like from your experience, how do you take the information that you're getting onto the ground and communicating it in a way that's inspiring to your team so that they don't get burned out from the constant changes? You said in your book, your assistant has like a funny term for a word that's super, super important. So just curious how you drag your team during that process along. Empathy. Empathy is a superpower. Like I understand that I may be driven or have more natural energy than the people around me. I've never from the day that I started operating thought that my employees should work as hard as me. I think one of the great mistakes that founders and leaders get caught up in is thinking that their employees should work as hard or harder than them. If you want them to work as hard as you, give them half the business. You know, so I think in a co-founder situation, that's a little bit different. You know, are you talking about the rest of the company or are you talking about your actual co-founder? My actual co-founder. That one is hard. Have you guys divided and conquered the business? We've been talking about conquered. He does the product and engineering and I do the sales. So I'm speaking to the customers all the time. Got it. And so you're coming home and you're like, hey, you gotta make these changes. I'm doing just. By reminding him that if you don't make the changes customer wants, you guys are gonna go out of fucking business. Correct. And then, and then you just get a sense of like, how he's reacting. Usually in this scenario, if you think he's epic, but it's too much and you're smart and you're like, fuck, I need seven more features that's not feasible with him and the two person team, where you wanna get into a place is, how do you add more resources to the team? Right, do you raise more capital? Do you borrow? You know, like, and then sometimes you have to make a tough decision. The amount of sales driven co-founders that have had to force out their technical co-founder and the amount of technical co-founders who were capable, but their sales focus leader wasn't able to sell. That's a very common game in co-founders. It's a great partnership when it's right. I would just recommend kind candor. I think kind candor is something that took me a long time. Believe it or not, I'm super candorous on stage. I just did it, yay. But in real life, if I like you, it was hard for me to tell you the truth because I'm overly positive, optimistic, and I eat shit, I do it for a living, and I put it on my back, I'm that guy, and it allowed me to build resentment, and it made me sloppy in firing. And so I think kind candor, because a lot of people use candor, radical candor was a term for a while. I think people use candor a lot of times to weaponize politics and just being a dick. And I think kind candor is a different game. It's like, yo, how long have you guys been together? 14 months. Right, you're like, listen, we've been on this journey hard for the last year, plus I get that I'm asking for these things. Maybe you wanna come with me so you can see what I'm seeing because it's not gonna matter if they don't want it. You just gotta try honey, vinegar, optimism, fear. Like you gotta be like a fucking Swiss army knife, right? Like too many people just have a screwdriver and they try using screwdriver. You need 78 moves to make it happen. And then sometimes you have to look in the mirror and be like, is this actually the right partnership? Thank you, thank you. You're welcome. I'm Mario Gaa, 21. Pleasure. Currently founding a health startup currently. Awesome. One of our big focuses is going to be digital marketing. Yes. You talk a lot about it. I like guys like Russell Bunson. Yes. About what the next thing is going to be and staying ahead of the game. What do you think is going to be that next thing that comes for digital marketing that will reinvent the business? Live social shopping. Now what's cool about live social shopping, obviously we sell wine or trading cards or t-shirts, easy. It's QVC, it's home shopping network. It's whatever you had here in Canada. I'm sure you had some version. If you're selling a SaaS business, if you're selling a service business, it would seem counterintuitive. But I do think that live streaming in that environment is going to work quite a bit. Other than that, usually my answer to your question is I don't know. I don't really know what's next. My skills over the last 20 years has been to act fast when I see it. Like I know that way too many people don't market on LinkedIn enough. That's why I made a big point of it in this book that everybody has. I know that YouTube shorts is really good because people don't realize that YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world. So I know that Google AdWords is in trouble because AI is coming and people are using chat, GPT and Proplexity instead of going to Google. And if you're not using Google, you're not gonna see Google Ads. So people that are 100% reliant on Google AdWords are very vulnerable right now over the next five years. Not tomorrow, but five. So I know influencer marketing is still grossly underpriced depending on how smart you are and how you deploy it. Some people are a great deal, some people are a rip off. It's not just following count. There's a lot of art and science underneath these tactics. What's the health startup? We're a platform that allows health service providers to connect with consumers from within their own home. You shouldn't live on LinkedIn. Live. The way, if you read the book or if you see my current content, what I'm trying to get all of you to understand is organic content first, if it does well, then media. The last chapter pre-IOS 14.5 update was A.B. testing variants with media, $50, $100, $500, get what works, then pour lighter fluid on it. Today's world is organic social to see what actually pops, then convert it to performance. If you live on LinkedIn and make content that you think will bring value to the people that you're targeting and that thus brings awareness to what you do, if you see something pop off, your first post might get 13 views, might get seven. But when you get that one that gets 400 or 5,000 or 20,000, if you convert it into a free trial or a seminar, you need to really, really spend a lot of time in LinkedIn because for free, no media spend, just organic, that is where your customer is. Thank you. You got it, brother. Thank you. Thank you. You got it, brother. Thank you. My man. Hi, Gary. My name's Francesco. First of all, I just want to say thanks for coming out. Of course. Any time today. I'm pumped to be here. I love your idea of the Jab Jab Hook. Yes. Well, what I want to ask you, you got any advice to not put your media, your people, unsuccessful ventures in, honestly, sure what kind of value to provide or what that kind of thing will be? So I wrote a book called Jab Jab Jab Right Hook. And it was basically the precursor to the purple book here, wrote it 10 years ago, when I could see that people didn't understand how to do social media marketing. I explained that at the time in 2013, to be honest, even now, too many people, every post, is a sales pitch. We don't want that. And so the concept was give value, give value, give value. And then you can ask, Jab Jab Jab Right Hook. Obviously, when I was selling wine from my dad's store, I was educating people about wine, educating people about wine, educating people about wine, and then I might sell a different kind of, I would ask for the sale. Well, I think first you have to decide what the fuck you're selling. So if you decided to sell a stunt hand lotion, you might provide value in the terms of how to do things at home to protect your skin. You might be educating people. You take what you're doing, and then you're giving them value. When Rick was in the apparel business doing cool hoodies and shirts of that nature, they could have done a lot of content of tips to do when you go out. Best advice of nightlife in a market. I think people have to think like a publisher and a news outlet and a provider of value, and then go in. So it depends on what you're going to sell. If you want to start a company, before you figure out how to do your marketing, you have to figure out what the fuck you're selling. Do you preach balance on young age? How do you manage their time? Yeah, I mean, look, here's the fun thing about balance. Who gets to define it? Like when you ask me about balance, do I preach it? Yes. My balance for 17 years was working 19 hours a day, and I loved it. I have a funny feeling that's not balanced by most people's point of view. So of course, but you have to realize, you have to define balance for yourself. Work-life balance, balance, who gets to be the judge? So what do you consider balance? I guess doing what you love and if you love what you're doing, then you can do it for as long as you want. Correct. So the reason entrepreneurs, more often than others, are workaholics is you don't think it's working. I would punch myself in the face 5,000 times right now if I had to go to a fucking class on this campus. I don't want to do that. Right? But for a lot of people here, they can't wait. And that's awesome. But not for me. But working, like working this morning from 7 AM to 2 30, driving to the airport, on the phone working, getting on the plane and having an hour meeting with JTU, who I can see his face right now to plan our entire reorg for next year, was the best hour of the fucking week. Landing, working, quickly calling my son, catching up with my friend, meeting my new friend, and then standing here and working to bring value, to now go back in the plane, work the whole flight, land, work, and then get home and hang out with my kids. All that work is better than any fucking thing else I could do. I don't want to fucking go skiing. I don't want to fucking play video games. I don't want to fucking golf. I don't want to watch a fucking movie. I don't want to do, I want to fucking work because I love it. So for me, the balance is good. There's people that work 40 hours a week, nine to five. They live for being on the softball team or going home and watching a movie. And they can't wait for the weekend. And they love a fucking national holiday. And I don't think they're balanced. I think they fucking hate 40 hours of their week. That, got you. And by the way, brother, I love that question, because that whole little rant, that's entrepreneurship. That's right, my man. Right? And people get it twisted. That doesn't mean like, don't be healthy and fucking die at 47, who gives a fuck? Like fuck money. I'm gonna say it slow if you get confused about what I said. Fuck money. Of course you need it, you need a roof over your head. The game. Would you rather do it than anything else? And then, by the way, I understand passions for other things. You could call me this Sunday at 1 p.m. and tell me that the internet has been banned. So has the alcohol, so has the blockchain. You can't do intellectual property companies anymore. Entrepreneurship is banned in North America. And I would literally pick up the phone and say, I'll call you three hours from now, the Jets are fucking playing. I understand passions and doing other things. But like balance, what's balance? Every family's got their own balance. Every person's got their own balance. And so we get into these ideologies without really defining it. It's like parenting. I have lots of passions about modern parenting, but I would never tell another man or woman how to raise their child. That's how I think about balance. I have lots of balance. I just share them. But I do not have the audacity or the delusion to tell you what balance is. I'm 21 and I was wondering, you talked so much about social media being such a powerful tool of inspiration. But for so many of us, I think in this room, it's such a big distraction and distracts us from our passion projects. And I know when students have asked you in the past, you said, don't like Instagram, delete it. But a lot of times, that value that we get from social media, it's difficult to give up. So do you think a healthy relationship with social media is possible? Of course. Or if so, how do you foster that healthy relationship where it's not consuming it all your time? By not judging yourself on your consumption patterns. You just said to me, I'm distracted from my passion, but I'm getting value from this. So then it's like alcohol. Alcohol out of balance is bad, bad, bad. Within balance, nice glass of wine with a nice meal. Pretty epic. So I think what's happened now is we are paralyzed by analyzing every fucking thing. Let me tell you about something funny about the 80s in America. Long before you were born, slightly down there, America, 1980s, do you know that at 10 p.m. every night in America, that on the television, this pre-internet, so the TV was live, there would be like a commercial that would pop up that said, it's 10 p.m. Do you know where your kids are? You remember that? Any Americans, anybody, anybody know what I'm talking about? Parents had so little clue what the fuck us kids were doing that the television had to remind them that we might not even be fucking home right now. We now live in a world that we wanna analyze everything. Of course I think that people can have a healthy relationship. Unlimited people do. We over fixate on the ones that don't. It's an indication to where the world is right now. Do you know any wonderful acts of kindness and graciousness and respect happened in the world in the last 24 hours? A lot more than despicable. Yet, all we do is pay attention to the despicable ones. We are over fixated on the wrong thing. If you get value from it, then you should use it. Of course you're gonna spend some time on it. But if you're not getting to your passion projects, that's not social media's fault. That's your fault. That's called discipline. That's called you're talking out of your fucking ass and your actions don't match it. I come up with all sorts of bullshit excuses to why I don't eat as well as my fiance wants, but they're fucking excuses. Nobody fucking made me eat those bullshit M&Ms on the plane. That. You're capable. Everything that's happening right now is the world is trying to tell you that you're not capable. Fucking, do you kids have this phenomenon too? There are 20 year old kids in here who have an app on their phone right now that their parents are tracking and know where you are. Most of you actually have that shit on your phone. You should delete it right now. That's fucked up. You're fucking grown up. That's a good sign. Love you guys back. Hi, how are you? Good. I'm so happy to be here. You can't imagine. So as the question going on, I think it's more final fucked up. Maybe they should say some more explanation a little bit. Please. I see no one was known about TRT, so I'm TRTQ. I'm an international student, PhD student coming here. And here I get to come here with entrepreneurship. They started my PhD in health science, but now going to entrepreneurship and do a little bit more different things. Yes. Integrating everything. So it's hard for me first is I think it's too late. That's crazy. That's crazy. You're 32. You're a fucking kid. You are. I get it. You're looking at like little kids around you, but you do know 32 is very young, yes? Yes. Okay. Don't listen. You're here. You should enjoy it. You should absorb this youthful energy. In fact, you should be 32 acting 22 because of what you're surrounded by. That's not a disadvantage. There's plenty of people that are 57 that are making a good decision today and starting their journey. Take it from somebody who's about to be 49. I feel 22. You should feel 22. Good. I'm a person, so... Yes. So I'm starting in... So creating a content. I'm studying a startup. Yes. So I started a website just recently to start creating content and gather a general audience for myself. Good. And the general thing is about integration of AI and health sciences. So I'm a physiotherapist also. I work with patients. Good. So there's a lot of things that you can do in this content. Good. But in your advice and social media and you're mentioning that AI is getting there. So we have virtual AI coming up. So everything is being more challenging. Of course. And how we can be more attentive. So maintain our authenticity and stand out in the years coming, especially with AI and it's gonna be much easier, much harder for us to be more attentive. I don't think so. I actually think authenticity doesn't change with the challenges of technology. On a human level, if you wanna be authentic, you're authentic. I get that it gets harder. I'll give you an example. You might've been super authentic in high school and then you came here and you wanna fit in and that first couple months, you've gotta navigate and maybe you're not fully yourself because you're trying to get the sense of what's going on. Makes sense. It's the normal flight of going to university. But the reality is some of the kids in this room, maybe when you came as an older student being, they just were authentic. They were comfortable like fuck it. Whoever's gonna be my friend's gonna be my friend on my shit, I'm gonna stand in my business of who I am. So to me, authenticity is not gonna be hard with AI. We will consume AI, things that are technology, but for a human to be able to stand out on their authenticity, charisma is a very powerful trait. Knowledge is a very powerful trait. The ability to be funny and humor powerful. So there's a lot of ways to stand out in your authenticity. The thing that nobody does, brother, is they don't do it. Do you know why I'm on this stage? Cause I posted 700,000 fucking times and I didn't give a fuck what anybody thought. And if I got one like, I'd be fine. And if I got a thousand, I'd be fine. The mass insecurity problem of the judgment of other people is literally stopping people from having an enjoyable life. That. Thank you sir. Thank you. I'm working on a company right now and I have a very specific question. How do you build sales in a low trust environment? I'm working on something in tax and it's traditionally a very low trust environment. Companies don't wanna work with these, we do. I'm just starting out at very high sales. No sales, I'm a product, I apply to YC, I've applied to these places. I've got a lot of interest cause it's a very interesting industry to be working on. Working with renewable energy tax credits. So I've got a lot of interest but I'm struggling with sales cause they wanna work with people to establish and I'm not established. I can't establish myself without getting sales. I know the game. How many people have you asked? About 30 calls still now and I've had the same problem every time. And how many people are in the addressable market? How many more people can you sell this to? We're targeting people with 10 to 100 million dollars in revenues, that's 200,000 people in the US. Great, sounds like you have to call 199,970 more people. . . . . . . . You know, it's fun to see who gets it, clearly people get their fucking name on the building. . That's the right answer. 30? . Like leave right now and go call 70 before you go to sleep. Thank you. . . . . I want to make sure it's not like going over like when you have a sales problem, but you know this shaman's lucky He knows who he's going after and he knows like he answered a bunch like I'm Optimistic for him because he knows his got a 200,000 person, you know businesses addressable market He's gone to 30. He literally actually has to DM email Send a message on LinkedIn or make content that he targets to the employees of those 200,000 Addressable people on LinkedIn like he only needs one. Yes, you know that right? You know like you're like loser friend who never like has a girlfriend or boyfriend But then like finally they get one and then in the game that The answer always whether it's business or you're going out tonight is just ask the next person I Gary my name is Ian. I'm 18. Thank you for coming up tonight. We all have a new year. Thank you You said that you were blessed with a gift of Yes, I've heard some shit that fucking bailed good How do I know that if that's just part of my journey or if I just don't have the same gift? Have you had any successes? Look you're in the best spot, bro at 18 I don't know. I'm not fucking no Stradamus But you need to go and try three or four more things and real the most There was a lot of things I'm happy that I got to say today because I'm very improv in the way I roll This whole thing about do high-risk shit until you're 30. I promise you it's big It's big big especially if you do it around things you really love Right like really love snowboarding or the city of Paris. I'm being serious. It could be literally anything The answer is you're gonna have to try some more, you know, but this goes back to the new game like by the time I was 18 I like 747 businesses are like 39 of them did well. It's all I thought about. It's why I got such bad grades I was very pure bread There are plenty of entrepreneurs who are far more successful than me that didn't go crazy in their youth the way I did and started it around now and found their way I think you just got to try two or three or four more and then if you wake up and 24 years old and you remember this talk And nothing has happened for the last six years Maybe that's when you need to latch on to a pure bread entrepreneur Because your DNA might be a number two three four five six seven eight nine ten because you love the entrepreneur thing But you just might need to be the 12th employee in a great company not the ten thousandth one day Make sense. Yeah, gotcha My man you're looking sharp You came correct Fucking sharp, bro Yeah, you brought a suit Look up for you. Yeah, man. You look great Yes I think the glasses you're wearing right now in seven or eight years might take it out Like you know because when we go the phone was conducive to Being our primary device to allow social to be quite effective. I think when glasses come and I don't know if you saw Zuckerberg's keynote I was actually in it so I've actually previewed the new glasses That's some different shit and even though I wore them and saw my Instagram and things that nature You can start developing how other things will emerge because the whole context of VR and AR will change The phone just like the television Just like the radio just like the printing press will have a run and Then it will start to decline Right now social is remarkably effective because of the format of the distribution as our distribution of information and Entertainment changes new form factors may come alive. So yeah, of course it will max out The reason I wrote this book day trading attention is it's not maxed out right now and no matter what a person's hopes and dreams are here professionally socially globally Family-wise it is stunning how a free platform social media is free Free when you post it's free when you buy a full-page ad in the newspaper here It's not free when you go try to buy a commercial On the BBC not free when you try to get a sign inside the stadium not free Nothing's free direct mail not free social media is free and the way it's written now with the tick-tock Vacation one post can get to everyone it can change your life one LinkedIn post can get you for Customers and we can change your life I'm just flabbergasted that people are not going all in on this free thing and that's why I wrote it And so right now it's the most underpriced lever to make good shit happen Um I Don't know like this private equity thing really fucked me up They made a new rule in the NFL that private equity firms can buy into teams So it's gonna skyrocket the values so I keep fucking like it's this fucking never-ending chase I keep getting bigger and it's working, but the fucking value keeps outpacing me But this goes back to what I want to tell you all it is my dream to buy my favorite football team I've had it since I was literally in fourth grade. I Believe I will but I promise you I will not be disappointed if I don't Chasing it is more fun than getting it Yeah, you touched on platform businesses software businesses in 2005 to 2008 how just Optimistic and rich these businesses and the people behind these businesses were yes What do you think? What lessons can we take can we learn from from that time in software and what can we take it? It's a great question, but I think what you can learn is that when Few see something it's always gonna attract the right kind of people It's really cool. You ask that question you the people that are innovating right now in virtual influencers and AI characters and in live shopping Have a different gear than the person that's just starting another social media agency or another AI bot You know AI's got a lot of that element But the new emerging things that are just on the verge of tipping off not ten years from now For example, I just talked about glasses. You seems like a lot of you raised your hands. You got a sense of me I'm not talking a lot about VR and AR you guys know that if you follow me. I'm watching it every day But I will talk about it when it's ready I've been watching virtual influencers if anybody here has family or has lived or spent time or pays attention to Japan This shit's been going down in Japan for a minute, right? I see some of the people shaking their head So live shopping I'm sure at this point some of you have seen the viral video of the lady in Japan just whipping fucking like Handbags and making eight million dollars in a fucking day eight million in a day So it was I'm always watching but I wait for timing. We talked about timing earlier What you can learn from 2005 to 2008 social media was that was the best talent because that was the thing that was about to tip All right, thank you so much. Got you Thank you
