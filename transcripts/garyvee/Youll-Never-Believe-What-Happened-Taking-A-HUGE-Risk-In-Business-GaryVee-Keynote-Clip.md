I'm like, read the tweets. They're like, bears, stop doing that. Jake Cutler, why'd you do that? Jake Cutler, I love you. Jake Cutler, stop throwing touch up. Jake Cutler, great touch up. Jake, this guy was obsessed with the bears. Jake Cutler, I said go to eBay and buy a Jake Cutler signed jersey and send it to him with a note that says thank you for shopping at Wine Library. They're like, the jersey's like 400 bucks. I'm like, I don't give a shit. Send it to him. Done. I'm like now pumped. I'm like, here's what's gonna happen. He's gonna get this framed Jake Cutler jersey with a note. Thank you from the Wine Library. He's gonna lose his mind. He's gonna tweet about it constantly. He's gonna convert all his business and all his friends. This is gonna be a great case study. And then four weeks go by and nothing happens. I'm boarding a plane to go to Napa. I get a phone call. Hey, hey, you'll never believe what happened. I believe that if you call every single person you've ever done business with over the last five years and said, hi, I'll use Peter Holland here. If I'm reading my eyes, Peter. Hey, Peter, Holland, it's Gary. Just calling you. I know we obviously did some work for you for 18 months ago. Just checking in if it's going well. Is everything fine? Good? Thank you. Hope you have the best day. That's the lowest thing you can do. Number two, you could also remember, because so many of you do, or the people that work with you do, you could also remember that Peter liked wine or like the Kansas City Chiefs or had 16 dartboards in his basement. Cause I don't know, he's a fucking dart enthusiast. You could go buy a $50 dartboard and send it to him with a note and say, hey, just wanted to thank you for your business 18 months ago. I believe that if you scale the unscalable. Right, we're in the whole talks of AI now and everything's so efficient and it's all technology. And I think if you go back to doing business, the way that our great grandparents did it, and call, not new people who are gonna give you money. No, no, no, thank people that already gave you money, that those people will actually on that action, even more than the quality work you did, the gesture of kindness when it was not expected, even a phone call or a letter or some flowers, chocolates, a bottle of wine. That that itself will substantially grow your business while everybody else is on defense. I believe this in 2011. I had an idea. I said to my internet department, I said every single order that comes in, Google the person's name, see if you can find who they are and then find them on Twitter. This is 2011. This is, Jesus, 13 years ago, it's crazy, time flies. So a lot of people have very common names, so it's kind of hard to figure out. But finally they found a name and the team calls me and says we found someone. I said good, you found him on Twitter? Yes, we found the gentleman on Twitter. I said who bought a very low end Pinot Grigio, I don't think it was Santa Margarita, but this gentleman literally bought like a hundred dollar case of Pinot Grigio, eight bucks a bottle, shipped to Chicago, nothing. We made like $3.09 on the whole order before overhead. We lost money on the order. But they found him and they said we found his Twitter. I'm on the phone, I'm like, what's he tweeting about? They go, we'll read him to you. Here are the tweets, ironically ties back down, probably why I'm telling the story of how I opened this talk. I'm like, read the tweets, they're like, Bears, stop doing that, Jake Cutler, why'd you do that? Jake Cutler, I love you, Jake Cutler, stop throwing touch, Jake Cutler, great touch up. This guy was obsessed with the Bears, Jake Cutler for all the football fans, if you remember, it was the quarterback at the time. The team goes, what do you want us to do? I said, go to eBay and buy a Jake Cutler signed jersey and send it to him with a note that says, thank you for shopping at Wine Library. They're like, the jersey's like 400 bucks. I'm like, I don't give a shit, send it to him, done. I'm like now pumped, I'm like, I finally found something, this is my thesis, the thank you economy, here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna send this Jake Cutler jersey to him, the guy bought a dinky hundred dollar case of wine, he's gonna get this framed Jake Cutler jersey with a note, thank you from the Wine Library, he's gonna lose his mind, he's gonna tweet about it constantly, he's gonna convert all his business and all his friends are gonna come and shop with us, this is gonna be a great case study for my thesis. I did a bunch of versions of this, but this is the one that really has a good story to it. I'm pumped and then four weeks go by and nothing happens. I'm like, this son of a bitch is so fucking ungrateful. And then I'm boarding a plane to go to Napa to go taste wine to buy for the store, and I get a phone call, hey, hey, you'll never believe what happened. And just the way he said it, I knew it was that, you know, because that was a month later, I really kind of forgot about it. I go, the Cutler guy did something, he said no. I said no, he said, we just got a $6,000 order, from Plano, Texas. I'm like, okay, for a bunch of high end burgundy and Barolo. I'm like, okay. He goes, I wanna read you the note that came on the order. I'm like, okay. Hey Wine Library, can you please hold these wines because it's the summer here in Texas and I don't want the wines to be shipped in this weather to be compromised. PS, your prices on red burgundy are remarkable. Can somebody call me, I have a very big seller in collection. I'd like to see if you have some other things. PSS, my friend who you sent to Jay Cutler Jersey too, told me about your store. PSS, I'm a huge Bruce Springsteen fan. You have two choices, in my opinion. The choice you don't have, is the choice you have to make. You have to make a choice. In my opinion, the choice you don't have is to keep doing what you're doing because I know that whoever does social hardcore organically and then has the right model will outflank you locally or the person that goes most old school. Do not be in the middle, it is the worst place. Go OG, OG, thank you economy. Or go new school, new school, social media, plumber of the year, but don't be here because here sucks. Thank you.
