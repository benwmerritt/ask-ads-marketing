Being somebody who makes $80,000 a year being a blogger about basketball is like being the 12th man on a team. You made it to the league, but you're not LeBron. You're one of the best basketball players in the world that nobody knows who you are, kind of thing. Like, there's no shame, as a matter of fact, the practicality of making $80,000 a year being a blogger about basketball, because you love it, versus making $109,000 a year as a lawyer is a great arbitrage for a lot of people. It's the unlocking happiness. Like, is your life better making $109,000 a year being a lawyer versus making $80,000 a year being a full-time basketball content provider? You know, I don't know people's situations. You may have loans, you may have this, but if you can afford it, I promise you, you're gonna be way happier doing the stuff that you wanna be doing. And those are choices everybody has to make for themselves. But when I say not everybody's gonna be LeBron, I mean not everybody's gonna be Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs. That's right, got it. But within their hobby and their job and making their career their hobby. That's right. They can be the 17th, there's a level of practicality that's different for everyone predicated on how fancy they wanna be. Like, where's your happiness and where's the things you want that you need money for? Where's that Mendoza line? There's a lot of people, for example, right now who are watching this, who are doing well and making $200,000 a year, but if they made 140, they'd be much happier. Got it? They start working, the machine takes over them, business eats them up. Like a lot of people think that happens to me when they don't understand me, they don't get it. I already won. I've won. I'm getting to play the game that I wanna play. Like, I don't need to make more. It's not like I need to make more. I need to make more because it means that I'm succeeding in the game that I'm playing. And that's where your passion comes in. Of course, I'm ultimately patient. I've already won. T-Rock, this game's big. I already won. I figured myself out. I know what makes me happy. Nothing in the world makes me happier than being able to. And by the way, this is for everybody. Everybody is the happiest when they get to do what they wanna be doing. When you get to do what you wanna do, you've won. That is the seductive nature of entrepreneurship because you have control. There's no boss. But the company can become your boss. Over-extending yourself and paying for your lifestyle can become your boss. Not paying attention to what makes you happy anymore can become your boss. And that's why I try to stay grounded in that stuff. Like, when people don't know me and a video goes viral and they're like, oh, this guy's just gonna be miserable. And he's, because he just wants to make money. You don't know me. You don't know me. Like, there's plenty of people that are miserable that are home all day. Misery doesn't come in the way you want to judge it. Misery comes in the way that it is for that actual person. And for me, the time I get to spend with my family and then the fact that I get to spend a lot of time playing the game that I wanna play is ultimate happiness. I would suffocate and die if I worked nine to six. I wouldn't be happy. Sorry, that's not politically correct. It's selfish. Like, I wanna work, that's six to nine, that so many of you go out to dinner with friends or watch shows or play volleyball or a part of that. That's what I'm doing. It's just three more hours of work. I like, my meeting is your card club. My meeting is your book club. My meeting is your pool table night. My meeting is your dart team. My meeting is your going to the shore and surfing. My meeting is your yoga. That's, like, you don't understand. That's what makes me happy. That's what makes me relaxed. I get relaxed when I'm working. Like, I'm sorry I'm not wired like you.
